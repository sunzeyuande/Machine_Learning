<text>college crowd obviously, but i needed to mention that the sampler appetizer platter is a complete ripoff at $10.79. you get three items, but hardly any of each. four mozzarella sticks, a few lousy boneless wings and they sliced the avocoda egg rolls in half, maiking it appear that you got more. as a matter of fact, there more sauces than food items on the plate and those were the thing that had leftovers. no late night happy hour like most other chili's either. it was good to have blue moon on tap since last night was the rare "blue moon". my version of a double double.</text>
<u_review>wanted to try the famous breakfast buzz drink. i did not like the fact that it was already prepared ahead of time. that might have caused some stomach issues. i paid and one second later there it was. i don't care if your busy, make my drink fresh or don't make it it all. plus at about 6 bucks, i think they are taking advantage of consumers cause of the popularity of the beverage.</u_review>
<u_review>some happy hour action here on a friday night with hh running until 7pm. they give you free chips and salsa and that salsa comes in weird flower like vases. not sure if they are trying to be different, but you might as well give us something we can dip our chips into cause a chip ain't fitting into that salsa casket. so, now you have to dump the salsa onto the plate and use two chips to get the chunky salsa onto your chip. dumb. the "hot" salsa really had no kick and was more sweet than anything else. beers were reasonable at $2.75 a pop and we tried two appetizers. the tostada's were standard with refried beans and lots of lettuce basically, but they gave about five per order at 4 bucks each. the better choice was the mini chimi's with fresh chunky guac at 6 bucks. get it stuffed with ground beef, it was pretty good and you get four of them per order. fairly crowded in the bar, but emptied out soon after hh ended. good value for the stuff we ordered.</u_review>
<u_review>kind of a mixed bag here on my first visit. this is the ultimate neighborhood bar experience because nearly every dude that entered during my two-hour stay was greeted by name. i had read about happy hour specials online prior, but when i asked about them to the heavily tattooed bargirl, she didn't mention them, instead telling me about the higher priced all-day special. how can you get new regulars if you treat the newcomers like we are from planet mar?  maybe they got enough regulars, but they might need to get younger cause some of regulars are getting old. she did become nicer after i chatted up one of her old buddies at the bar and she even put the yankees game on the small bar tv for me. the food i ordered to go contained the worst version of sweet potato fries ever - burnt and undercooked at the same time (see photo). the western chicken was pretty good though featuring two giant onion rings and a rather large thin cut chicken breast covered with cheese and bonus bacon which wasn't on the original description. the bun took a beating with too much bbq sauce, but overall not bad. it is supposed to get crowded at night, might check it out then and happy hour prices are good on domestics also.</u_review>
<u_review>gotta say, i usually only order pancakes at denny's and they usually are solid each time. several times though, i did order a burger in a vegas denny's and it was actually hand formed and that was good too. here at 9am today and can't say anything bad. dining companion had a big omlette that was well cooked and served with english muffin and hash browns - she said it was good. i wasn't that hungry and went with a short stack of three buttermilk pancakes with fresh sliced bannas on to for $4.50. waiter refilled my coffee three times and was pleasant and there was also some regular's there that the servers knew by name (i hope i don't become one of them), but it was a nice touch. menu is now huge and grand slam was on special for 5 bucks. seats in the booth are well worn, so slide your butt to the end of the booth and you should be fine. not as crowded (half full) as you would expect, but a goiod start to the day and coffee was hot and hit the spot.</u_review>
<b_review>ok so i am on vacation and generally love to try the local hot spots.  but we decided to come to chillis.  after all i did want ribs.  our service was pretty good.  he recomened a few late night hot spots and brought me a great local beer.  devil ale i belive. a great hoppy little beer.  the ribs were.. well they are what you come to expect.    chillis has great queso dip and friendly emplpyees  it was a good choice.</b_review>
<b_review>i had the most bizarre experience here last night. as the location for the b-day dinner with family, i arrived a bit late (hey, i parked near n. mill and wanted to walk) and walked in hurriedly, looking around to spot familiar faces. to my left, i saw a young woman waving at me. i looked at her; she looked at me. i looked at the hostess; the hostess looked at the young lady. i looked away to try and spot my family. the young woman waved again. i furrowed my brows and looked around - was she waving at somebody behind me? i looked at the hostess again, who looked equally befuddled. i walked in the direction of the young woman. she said happily, "alison!" i stepped closer, leaned down to let her get a good, clear look at my face and whispered, "i'm not alison." then i walked off, turning the corner and locating my party. of course i had to tell the story to my family. it was bizarre, after all. the hostess walked by a couple minutes later (while i was telling the story) and said, "did she think you were someone else?" i pointed at the hostess to add credibility to my story. "see, exactly."  that set the stage for a very enjoyable and often humorous dinner. from the topics of "best friends with naked benefits" to dirty playground jokes to politics, we discussed a wide range of topics. we also enjoyed our meal. i had a salad with shrimp. the waiter was happy to accommodate my request to substitute shrimp with chicken. i also ordered a 22 oz blue moon (on happy hour price). since it was both my and my brother's birthday (we are 5 years apart), we got two free desserts. i let my family select what dessert they wanted. i would have gone with something chocolate, though. my brother went with the white chocolate lava cake. so did my parents. i ate a little bit of it, but soon noticed that my inability to eat white chocolate hasn't change. it's just way too sweet.   as for the meals, everyone seemed to enjoy theirs. my dad got the guiltless salmon with extra veggies. my brother order fajitas. my step mom got something she didn't order, although it did have chicken and shrimp in the mix. she picked at it. when i tasted a piece of her shrimp, i noticed it tasted burnt. gross. no wonder she didn't eat much. she didn't seem to mind, though.  as for the service, it was great. the waiter knew it was a birthday dinner. he was attentive and fast. when the check came, a manager came over to ask whose birthday it was. i, slightly buzzed, gestured wildly and unrestrained to communicate it was mine birthday, as well as my little brother's. the manager thought that was cool. "it's also their grandpa's birthday," my step-mom said. my brother chirped up, "and the cat's!"   we hugged our goodbyes in front of chili's and my brother and i set off down n. mill to find something else to do to celebrate. all in all, a very nice birthday dinner. chili's may not have been my first choice in "fine dining" on such an occasion, but i know it's family-friendly and pretty standard in the food and service it delivers. usually i avoid chain restaurants like genital warts (or so i try), but i can hang at chili's. after all, they have a little bit of something for everyone.</b_review>
<b_review>there is a new chicken quesidilla that has breaded chicken in it. the 1st time it was ordered it was burnt and folded very strange. didn't taste good at all. second looked better but still had breaded chicken in it. management did not offer to refund us for 1st ruined item but offered another item like an appetizer for free and then was rude when we commented about the fact that we didn't like the fact the chicken was breaded. bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit.</b_review>
<b_review>i haven't been to a chili's in a long time so while roadtripping it through tempe with a friend, it seemed like a logical choice.  i've always been pleased by past experiences at the ones near home so i was curious whether or not i would have the same experience here.  i did. my friend and i got there pretty late so it wasn't terribly busy. we were immediately seated and our server was there in no time.  i ordered a blue moon and a chicken salad.  the beer came out almost immediately and the wait for the food wasn't long at all.  our server checked in frequently and was always friendly.  even though i've been to quite a few chili's, this place did slightly exceed my expectations. i guess that's what happens when you take a break for awhile.  either way, this is a good location in my opinion.</b_review>

<text>3.8 stars.  pretty good pub atmosphere, great chips and pretty good fish, especially for the desert.  my fish could best be described as a plank.  three good size cod fillets that were bonded together by the beer batter.  in the traditional english style, i prefer the haddock fillets but you really only find that in england and new england.  the batter was laid on a bit heavier than i care for but it was still good batter.  the chips were nice long slices...perfect.  the tarter sauce was slightly sweet, i prefer it tangier.  portions were good, particularly for the fish.  *fyi-  fibber mcgee & molly was an early and long running radio show and is considered by many to be a precursor to the modern sitcom.</text>
<u_review>latkes and blintzes and pickles oh my!  i just came from dinner here - best ny style deli in the valley.  i am thrilled and a little frightened at the implications of chompie's opening 5 minutes from my office.  i thoroughly enjoyed the crispy, slightly oniony latke (potato pancake) appetizer.  my chocolate phosphate was to die for.  maybe not that good but it was spot on.  my corned beef on rye?  like buttah.  oy like i need a great corned beef sandwich 5 minutes from the office.  i loved the decor and the hustle and bustle the place already has.  great ny scenes all around blended in with an open modern feel.  bonus wifi room past the deli counter.  yes, you'll see me there with my laptop, coffee and some of that divine looking chocolate ruglach i saw in the case.  mazel tov to the borenstein's on this great addition to the southeast valley!</u_review>
<u_review>i had some visitors from corporate in town - one for our annual operations inspection, one to have a look at some of the tactical marketing we're developing in my region.  anyway, they wanted to eat here so...  here we were at traders vics.  the atmosphere is nice, island themed opulence and texturally pleasing.  we were greeted very warmly and sat in the bar for cocktails and a snack before dinner.  the drinks were tasty.  the appetizer "tidbits for two" varied from good to uninteresting.  we moved on to the dining room.  it was a thursday night and the place was d ecidedly e mpty a nd d evoid (dead) of customers.  i tried one of the specials which was some sort of thai inspired noodles with curry and some seafood and peanut and some mild pepper spiciness and...and...and...i frankly don't remember what it was supposed to be because it frankly wasn't anything.  too many things going on, nothing made a big impression.    the other diners apparently chose better because 2/3 of them were happy with their dinner.  wait, if there were 4 of us and i wasn't thrilled and only 2 of the other 3 diners were happy that means that 2 of the 4 or 50% of the diners were underwhelmed.  now if trader vic's had been traveling north on a train at 75 mph and had 160 miles to travel...wait i think i just had a flashback to sixth grade math.    ok, my bottom line impression of trader vic's - kind of cool atmosphere, interesting history (i think they were owned by merv griffin) and the food was average at a premium price.   oh and the bathrooms were very nice.</u_review>
<u_review>if you go to cafe carumba try the charuscurra (sp) sticks.  and the rocky point pizza.  and the spicy jalepeno sausage slider things.  and the mini chimis.  and the...well try whatever you can but unless you are with a big group for an event you may not that far through the offerings.  i attended an event at cafe carumba and i was impressed with the food and the service.  i would keep them in mind for corporate gatherings or even a small meeting (they have a private room for such things).    the staff at the bar was great as were the servers.</u_review>
<u_review>save money!  eat at lolo's!  go here for an early lunch and you are set for the day!  perhaps a small snack 6-8 hours later but that's pretty much it!  my second visit to lolo's didn't quite measure up to the first visit...and still it was 4 stars.  great company with a group of yelpers and my family too!  seriously, i was full 6 hours after eating here.</u_review>
<b_review>i was disappointed with the fish & chips last night. we've had it many times before and it's always been a go-to menu item for me. but last night the piece of fish was half it's usual size and they must have changed their fries. they were small schnibbles of fries & were on the greasy size. i'll go back but i'll try a different menu next time.</b_review>
<b_review>just tried out fibber's on the way home with some friends the other day. all of us would agree that this is a 5-star. the atmosphere was very cool, open and easy to get around. the service was excellent and our waitress was very attentive. the beer was great and great selection! the food was outstanding. 2 of us got fish and chips and it was huge! a large piece of fish right on top a gigantic order of fries, definitely a knife and fork meal. 1 of my friends got a shepard's pie and it was also huge. he said it was delicious and judging by the dent he put in it, he wasn't lying.    myself and another friend got a burger and it was so damn good and  cooked perfectly to medium as i had asked. i got bacon because i'm a man and it was a different type of bacon but was insanely delicious along with the great fries. $5 burgers on mondays or all you can eat fish and chips on friday's we saw there, so we'll definitely be back. huge fan, would love to see some live celtic music that people are talking about below. try this pub, especially if you love a good atmosphere and pub food!</b_review>
<b_review>we have been coming to fibbers for over 8 years.  have always enjoyed the atmospher, staff, and fair prices.  they have good food for a bar.   lately the staff they have brought in is less than spectacular.  they are slow, unfriendly, and need to learn a little bit about customer service.  we sat at the bar last night and waited over 10 minutes just to have them take our drink order.  we had to flag down the bartender pj several times to get food orders and our second round of drinks.  i found him to be rude and condescending when we dealt with us.  also noticed several other customers had to flag him down to order more drinks. not what i consider good customer service.  there were a few people in the place but it was not what i would consider busy.   food took well over 30 minutes to arrive.  we just ordered flat bread and a salad.  in the past this would have been there in under 15.  the flat bread was cold and a portion of it was missing.  it must have stuck to the pan when they were making it.  in the past the place always felt like the comfortable bar to stop by after work, now it felt cold.   like i said, we have been coming here for years but if the service is like this the next time we stop by, we might need to look at other options.</b_review>
<b_review>fibbers, it had been a while.  went down on a wednesday night, and it was perfect for a second date. the background music was at the perfect level for conversation and the staff was friendly.  while i'm still sad that they took my favorite item off the menu, the food was excellent.  i had a chicken sandwich, and it was juicy and perfect.  kevin had the shepherds pie, and loved every bite of the tender lamb.   later on, there was some live music, but as it was one singer with an acoustic guitar, it was the first time conversation was possible with live music.  she played at the right level for the smaller weekday crowd.  our server was great, as we moved from patio, back inside, back to the patio, and was friendly and prompt all night.</b_review>

<text>ever since i started getting daily e-mails from my bureaucratic overlords reminding me of the impending layoffs, unpaid furloughs and "department consolidations" i have to look forward to, i've been cutting back on going out and actually enjoying myself. mostly because they cut all my hours and i still need to find a way to pay my therapist.  so for the last week or so it's (haha, proper use of the apostrophe, bitches) been ramen noodles, rice, ramen noodles, peanut butter, and ramen noodles.   i've been trying to make the most of it. i look up ramen recipes on the internet. i make aesthetically pleasing bentos out of them. i even put pictures of my lunch on my livejournal, perhaps to maintain the illusion that i'm "challenging myself" rather than desperately clinging to the edge of poverty.  alas, no how i try to psyche myself, there is no pick me up for the buzz kill one experiences when eating 15 cent noodles in front of your computer when your stomach and smug sense of culture are screaming for something...more...  like dim sum. like great wall's dim sum.  this morning i was stewing another batch of "failure food" when the insane craving for dim sum hit me like homosexual tendencies striking a fundamentalist preacher giving a sermon on how g*d hates rastafarians.  on the outside, great wall looks like another two-bit strip mall attraction. you know, like all the stores next to it. but inside it's like the dining room of hotel awesome, where somewhat discontent-looking servers push around carts of delicious and deliver plates of fuck yeah to your table where you and your party can divvy them up/fight over them. whatever fits your interpretation of darwinism.  to be honest i'm surprised more people don't fight over the food.  for a mound of their delicious lo mein i would probably break a chair over someone's face.   for a plate of their pork buns i would falcon punch someone in front of their kids.  this may seem a little aggressive...but it can be a fucking battle royale in there.  especially when you don't have anyone in your party who speaks the language.  "uh, yes, i'll take some of that, no, that, yes the thing with the shrimp in it. oh, and some of that, too. no. to the right. yes. oh shit, where'd our ticket go?"  i remember watching a muppet babies episode once where the children were eating gruel or something and they suggested trying to imagine it as something tastier.  i tried that. it's a lot harder than it looks.  you swirl those nickel-and-dime noodles around on your fork and you try to imagine crab puffs or plates of peppered shrimp or mango pudding.  you try to imagine being surrounded by all your friends, plus some people you've just met, plus a whole restaurant of people speaking in their cafeteria voices (i.e. screaming at the top of their lungs).  and then you open your eyes and take a bite.  and you realize that you're alone in front of your computer screen with a mouth full of chopstick because in your daydreaming you drop your ramen all over yourself.   fuck.  i would crash a mini-motorcycle into someone's groin right now for a plate of their lumpia or shrimp dumplings.  dammit.  does anyone need someone to paint their nails and take them out shopping?   i can't keep living like this.</text>
<u_review>i often wonder if atomic comics is the result of black magic, if through a faustian pact the owners acquired the same interior design secrets that make places like wal-mart and target formidable labyrinths of compulsive consumerism.   there is literally nowhere to go in atomic comics. the aisles are thin and take too long to navigate, whatever free space that would normally be available is taken up by displays and t-shirt racks, and unlike samurai or all about crooks & comics, who usually staff one or two guys at a time, atomic usually has like four or five people on shift at a time, who all want to know if you need help looking for something.  yeah, actually, i'm looking for the section of your store that isn't laughably overpriced.   in an attempt to drown out the mindless musings of the many nerds, dorks, gamers and "trading card enthusiasts", this atomic comics has a large-screen tv on which they play movies, usually obscure anime or the latest animated marvel movie.   this is becoming commonplace in comic & gaming stores and i tend to like it. however, like time travel and the music video, this originally good and beneficial idea is made belligerent and threatening to human goodness when placed in the wrong hands.  imagine trying to search for alan moore's top ten or grant morrison's run of doom patrol while poorly dubbed anime and kevin smith movies are played at full blast, with a soundtrack provided by doughy keyboard jockeys arguing comic book logic.  "okay, so mjolinr can only be held by the righteous, right? but let's say it's laying on a chunk of earth, and the hulk lifts the chunk of earth up. does the hammer just fall through? does it stay on that patch of ground?"  my satanic pact theory becomes more and more sound by the second, doesn't it?  the only reason that i spare atomic comics from my 1 star of fury is that i have always been able to find what i've been looking for. unlike samurai, which splits its inventory between two stores, and all about crooks and comics (yes, i said crooks, not books), who stopped giving a shit after all the other stores started springing up, atomic comics have an excellent selection in every shop.  granted, you have to search meticulously through their "by title" system, unless you're looking for a crossover or whatever graphic novel's being made into a movie at the time, at which point it will have it's own display.  perhaps worst of all, atomic comics is not local-friendly.   gasp.  ac refuses to carry any comic that bears advertisements for their competitors (mainly samurai). this wouldn't be such a dick move if mike at samurai wasn't like the bob ross of comic store owners.   i was told once this was a result of bad blood; most of the samurai crew were once employees at atomic, and somewhere the guys from aab&c fit in there somewhere.  it was one, but split into many and became enemies.  like if the greek empire was a bunch of comic book stores.  i'll admit i have no idea if my analogy has any factual basis. professional rivalry aside, though, you shouldn't fuck an up and coming artist/writer just because they wanted to show their gratitude to the local scene for helping them out.   personal tastes aside, atomic comics does have a really good selection of comics, manga, and all that useless memorabilia shit that you buy, put on a shelf, and never look at again.  i will say this though; they have the coolest fucking merch bags evar.  in fact, they're too cool.  i bought the kingdom come trade a day before leaving for a flight to texas. i'm really picky about taking things out of their packaging too early, so i just stuffed the book, still in its bio-hazard design bag, in my suitcase.  the next day, on my way out totexas, i was chosen for a surprise inspection.  the tsa employee saw the biohazard bag and nearly tased the ever-loving shit out of me.  whenever i pass an atomic comics, i think of being accosted by airport security. and whether or not hulk could in fact lift a patch of earth carrying mjolnir.  your results may vary.</u_review>
<u_review>people often make the mistake of assuming i know what i'm doing. that i'm a woman with a plan.   it's an easy error to make; i'm a somewhat articulate woman working towards a bachelor's degree who holds multiple state credentials. yeah, i guess a certificate with a photocopied signature on it can count as credentials, right?   but in reality, there is no method to the madness. like a jazz soloist or a republican defending anti-gay marriage laws, i'm just making this shit up as i go along.   i am often overwhelmed by seemingly trivial decisions, like "what color should i paint my nails today" or "should i give this place 1 or 2 stars?"   places like coldstone or baskin robbins, therefore, frustrate me to no end.  do i get a flavor i know i'll like? or do i branch out? but what if that flavor's totally nasty and i can't finish it? what mix-ins should i get? oh god there are people in line behind me, make up your mind, voice in my head!!!  when amanda b brought me to chill, the first thing i noticed was the wide array of gelato flavors. immediately, i felt myself paralyzed with indecision.   oh shit. pineapple and coconut? dulce de leche? sweet zombie jesus, they have a twix flavor! oh eris, goddess of cha--oh wait, you wouldn't do me any good in this situation, would you?  off-handed, perhaps sensing my panic, amanda's sister allison grinningly said to me "you've got to try the chocolate pistachio. it's the best."  at first i was a little hesitant to take her suggestion. while chocolate is awesome and pistachio is awesome, 2 x awesome does not always awesome squared.   other examples of two awesome things that suck when put together;   babies and movie theaters. girlfriends and strip clubs.   roleplaying games (fuck yeah i slayed a dragon!) and the internet (sorry guys, i can't go out tonight, gotta stay home and do a raid with my guild).  but allison assured me that this would be all the chocolatey pistachio goodness i could ever ask for. i was sold.   legend has it that once, an italian merchant once gave buddha a bowl of gelato. buddha was so delighted with the dessert that he reciprocated the gesture and gave the merchant a book of buddhist teachings to bring back with him to italy. unfortunately the merchant's ship was sunk on the voyage home, and buddhism didn't reach italy for hundreds of years.  what does that have to do with my review? nothing.   the chocolate pistachio really was amazing. and at 2.59 for a small it has a reasonable cost/delicious ratio (i'm assuming anyway. allison covered me in the event i didn't like mine so she could finish it herself).   i may not be as well versed in the art and science of gelato as others, but i can tell you from my limited experience that it was creamy, chocolatey, smooth, nutty and everything i am told gelato is supposed to be.   maybe next time i will choose a flavor by myself. but i wouldn't count on it. i was late for work today because i couldn't decide which pair of pink flip flops would better match my sarah jessica parker jeans.   i am completely flabbergasted as to how i get out as much as i do.</u_review>
<u_review>there's really nothing i can say about lost leaf you don't already know, so i went ahead and put together small, manageable lists of my completely unwarranted opinions.  things i like: -the "someone used to totally live here but we made it into a party place!" vibe so characteristic of roosevelt row.  -everything comes in a can or bottle. i don't know why, but it seems so futuristic, like those automat's you see in movies set in the 50's (there was one in dark city, i think). that and draft is overrated. there. i said it. anyone who's been to yard house knows that for every draft beer there is a bad pipe and inexperienced bartender waiting to permanently defame your favorite beer.  -all the kitschy "art for art's sake" pieces that didn't make the cut to be displayed at modified arts.  -a menu that clearly states the price of each spirit in a font that is universally legible. the prices might be a little high, but at least they're consistent. none of this "today i think i'll charge five dollars instead of four" hooey you get at other bars (you know who you are...)  -total safe space. as amanda's boss most eloquently said "girls keep going into the bathroom in twos...i think they're doing drugs...or something...."  things i don't necessarily care for:  -the tables that go up to your chin. this is not a reasonable way for anatomically correct adults (especially those consuming liquor) to be seated. you're a bar. lose the lifeguard chairs.  -they only stock two lambics. at 8 dollars a can, you can afford to have more of a selection than just framboise and peche. jesus, what are we, barbarians?  -the sore throat i got (admittedly in vain) trying to speak over the music.</u_review>
<u_review>==warning: much of this review will contain lingo pertaining to the lgbt community. if you come across a word you aren't familiar with, wikipedia it.==  ever since homme gave me the boot, i'd been looking for other lgbt-friendly bars to take my business (and obsession with pool, which i totally suck at).  when my friend fenyx (a fellow tranny in the "ftm" vein) first suggested going to bunkhouse, i was admittedly a little anxious. don't get me wrong; i have no problems being around bears. but gay bars are opened so that people of that orientation can mingle and socialize within it, and i don't like being anybody's unwanted guest.   bunkhouse is like a living, breathing outback steakhouse commercial; "men's men" sit around a fire pit, joking and laughing underneath the gaze of totem poles. the interior is so fabulously "frontier". multiple big screen tvs play muted cable programs that are ignored by the patrons. it's like a bizarro sports bar. and i know bizarro.  one of the many reasons i prefer lgbt-bars to "straight bars" is that every gay bar i've been to in this city, every drink i order, no matter how obscure and/or hard to memorize, is given to me enthusiastically. sometimes it's outrageously expensive, especially if i'm not the gender of the bartender's preferred company.   and sometimes i'm given the stink eye when i insist on being given the correct, iba-sanctioned garnish with my drink. i'm just trying to get the most out of my pbsa education. don't judge me.  but never once have i been told "you want a what? are you gay?" (river city) or "yeah, that's not going to happen" (tiki lounge). not even at homme.   at bunkhouse i asked for a colorado bulldog, and the bartender just nodded and made it happen for me, even though everybody around me all turned their heads and said "what the fuck is that?" and it was delicious. so delicious that i overlooked the fact that it was not served to me in the bucket glass as deemed appropriate by the iba. i think i officially need help.  i'm sure there were plenty of fun-loving interesting people at bunkhouse, but i didn't make any attempt to talk to any. i was too busy blowing all my quarters on the pool tables, pinball machines and electronic dart boards. surprisingly, these attractions were unmanned during my entire visit to bunkhouse, probably because, as mentioned before, people were too busy like, talking and socially interacting.   making new friends? fuck that, they have south park pinball!  at first i was a little uncomfortable, being the only girl in the bar. but by the end of the night there were other girls, a lesbian couple, and even some drag queens from the show at cruisin' 7th. and everyone was just as welcome as the bears and leather daddies.   the staff at bunkhouse was really friendly, in that genuinely swishy way. (oh noes, another strange and foreign word! i checked, wikipedia has an entry for this one too.) the staff at any bar really set the tone for the behavior of the patrons. the bartender could've given me that "what the fuck are you doing here" look when i came up to order my drink, thus setting off the alert to the patrons that perhaps i didn't belong there and needed to be treated as such.   but they were really nice to me, got me anything i asked, and when the soda gun started pouring out syrup-less soda water, they dumped the glass out into the sink and made me a new drink rather than just passing me the diluted soda water and shrugging. i've had my heart broken by bartenders in the past, but i think bunkhouse may be able to set me on the path to healing.  on sundays they have $3 burgers and $1 drafts. and on thursdays everyone runs around in their underwear, though now that the weather's getting cooler i don't see that happening so much. but i could be wrong.  you know, like i was about homme and setting my nickname as "transzilla".  now i think about it, i'm wrong a lot of the time.  but that won't stop you from taking my suggestions, will it?</u_review>
<b_review>i came to great wall tonight with my mom after reading the positive reviews from yelp. the location is fine, it's in a strip mall that is just about empty so there's plenty of parking to choose from. in terms of food, there's plenty of options. i opted for the chicken and broccoli and my mother got the chicken with orange sauce. we also split a delicious appetizer of meat dumplings. we were brought tea and the food came out after about 20 minutes.    the food portions were much larger than we anticipated and we could've split either one and would've been full. other than that, our experience was great and we look forward to coming back. the bill for two plates and the appetizer was $30.00. not the best deal out there, but you get what you pay for. the food was fresh and great and overall i would give great wall 4 out of 5 stars.</b_review>
<b_review>i think i have a discerning taste for dimsum being asian and all so it's hard to find a really good dimsum place in phoenix.  a friend recommended this place and it's pretty decent.  i can't say it's the best i ever had but i'd say pretty decent for phoenix standards.  the only place i have to compare this place to though is the golden buddah @ the chinese cultural center and i'd say great wall is definitely better.    we got there at 10am and were seated immediately.  however, they didn't have all the selections out until close to when we left, around 10:45.  it was disappointing but the foods we did have were good.</b_review>
<b_review>great dim sum!! it's very popular and my wife and i find it the place to be after early church on sunday. there are so many dishes that it's hard to find a favorite. the do serve noodles and rice is a rarity, if at all. we come every sunday. great food!! try the chrysanthemum tea which is next to impossible to find anywhere else.  you have to ask for it though or else you'll get the standard jasmine tea.  otherwise just sit back and enjoy</b_review>
<b_review>i went on a weekday a little before lunch time for some dim sum.  the place had maybe 8 tables occupied.  we were seated quickly.  there were more dim sum carts than there were workers.  since i didn't know the name of some of the items of i wanted, i ended up using my iphone to show the waiters a picture of the food.  a lot of the dim sum items were packed with meat, which ended up being too overwhelming for me.  the sticky rice seemed bland.  the daikon cubes were flavorless.  my favorite item would have to be the tripe.  i've had better luck at asian supermarkets that sold fast food dim sum.  does az have anything like that?</b_review>

<text>ken is still tops in my book, but just a quick update as today i experienced not only a perfect mani/pedi from julie/lia but lia proceeded to give me an acupressure massage for 20 minutes on my feet up to my knees.  note, it was an extra $30, but thirty bucks for twenty minutes in heaven isn't bad in my book!  every time i visit ken's, i get an extremely warm greeting (thank you amy and ken) and i leave pleased and feeling pretty.    take advantage of the yelper specials when you go; ironically, i keep forgetting to do so!</text>
<u_review>i've been in arizona almost five years already and until just last month, i never stepped foot into the galleria corporate centre.  but now that i have, i am pretty sure that coming into the office here will become a regular part of my schedule... and all of this because cafe conmigo is located in the atrium of the galleria building.  this morning i stopped to grab a cup of coffee from cafe conmigo and i met the owner of this little cafe, nancy.  just from my quick conversation with nancy, i could tell that this place has a lot of character and that nancy puts her heart and soul into this business... in addition to gourmet coffee drinks, cafe conmigo serves up all kinds of breakfast food, snacks, sandwiches, soups, etc... i checked out their website and saw that they update it weekly to post their daily specials too.  i'm finishing up my coffee and feeling a nice caffeine buzz as i type this review.  if you're in the area of the galleria building in old town, go check out cafe conmigo and say hello to nancy.  they are open monday - friday from 7:30am until 3:00pm.  ***oh, and the best part of all? my coffee with steamed soy milk was cheaper than at starbucks!</u_review>
<u_review>i'm a sucker for popcorn... i've never had a bite of popcorn that i didn't like... really, i swear!  i've had all kinds from healthy plain popcorn with nothing on it, to orville redenbocker, salted, buttered, caramel, cheese, herb, movie theater, and everything in between.  i especially love kettle corn because you get both salty and sweet, the best of both worlds.  so, when i thought about what to bring to the pool party i attended today, i decided i would bring a sampler package of poppa maize popcorn... i actually didn't realize how far poppa maize's location was from me at the time, but i went nonetheless and guess what? it did not disappoint!  it was worth the drive...  everyone at the party loved the popcorn and there was so much of it... i am sure there will be leftover and the beauty of the sampler pack is that the flavors are individually wrapped, so they will last awhile if need be.  i snagged a kettle corn flavor right off the bat - loved every bite.  i'll have to venture to try some of the other flavors next time, but for now, i'll just request one thing: poppa maize - please pop up another location closer to old town... if you do, i promise to pop in often!  mmmm... popcorn!</u_review>
<u_review>since i'm a regular at this location of the jungle lately, i only feel it fair to review this one too... (i reviewed the indian school location back in january).  this jungle is still one of our regular restaurants on the rotation - it's cheap, healthy, casual, and huge portions.  still consistent and i've never had a bad meal at any of the jungles.  i pretty much order the macro platter every visit, but on occasion i'll mix it up with a salad, wrap, or pizza.  most recently, i really mixed it up since i was feeling adventurous.  i ordered us an appetizer of 1/2 hummus and 1/2 garlic dip.  i really liked it!    the texture was smooth and it went well with both the pita and cucumbers we requested.  call me crazy, but i mixed it up even more and ordered the spinach pasta salad and added tofu to it for my entree - and again, delicious!  as a matter of fact, so good that i didn't even add my normal squeeze of sracha sauce!  if you haven't been to pita jungle, go soon - don't expect a fancy schmancy place; just go in with moderate expectations for good food that comes in big portions.  speaking of big portions, i'm off to eat my leftovers... :)</u_review>
<u_review>sorry natalie -  although i did enjoy the top secret pimiento cheese spread, and of course the company, i thought that my overall experience was only mediocre for the price... i'd been to j. alexander's before - i think to one of their michigan locations.  it didn't make a huge impression then, and it didn't this time either.  i think houston's food, service, and atmosphere actually blow this place away.   our server was justin and he did an ok job.  i went with the cobb salad and ordered a side of their butternut squash for the table to share.  salad was decent and squash was tasty.  maybe the way to go is to sit at the bar (or so natalie says).  i don't see returning anytime soon, but i would if someone twisted my arm.  although the food was decent, i'd rather spend my time and money elsewhere!  just meh, mediocre, average, etc...</u_review>
<b_review>gabi's review definitely influenced me to go here...   i've been trying to find a decent nail salon close to where i live, since getting "ripped off" by the last place. and i think i found it - -thanks gabi!   first of all, the pedicure massage chairs actually feel somewhat good and last longer than 45 seconds. ha! but i since my last mishap at a different salon, i really appreciated being handed a card here to select exactly what services i was interested in. (so you don't have to worry about pushy technicians... sneaking in extra and expensive services.)  and the pedicure itself was wonderful! a lot of detail went into my pedicure, maybe my toes were that bad?? ha! no, i think that's just the excellent service they provide here... they really take extra time with each client.   the massage during the pedicure was awesome, and i had originally extended it by $10. (good choice!)  also my manicure turned out really nice too. when my nails were drying they put a special oil drop to speed the drying process - - cool, never had that before!  great service for a mid-day afternoon. the salon only had a few customers when i entered, but got much busier... but the staff still maintained their personal service and was not rushing me out the door to get to the next paying customer.   i'll be back for sure! :)  oh, yes.. and that kids pedicure chair was so cute!</b_review>
<b_review>i was referred here because i needed a super hot manicure for my last minute trip to vegas.  i was able to make a reservation and this place did not disappoint. very clean, fast and the staff did not talk excessively to each other in another language, which was nice. this is my new place!</b_review>
<b_review>i was new to the area and needed a new nail salon, so i did some research on here and ended up at ken's. despite the fact that their decor could be updated and/or changed... i'm in love! all employees are kind and helpful, the entire building is clean, and i have never had a problem getting exactly what i want. they understand what you're trying to say and their work is phenomenal in my opinion. i would absolutely recommend this establishment to anyone... this is my new permanent nail salon!</b_review>
<b_review>thank you fellow yelp peeps. this place is a find. i was looking for something close to arcadia and listened to everyone's glowing reviews.  i just got home from a wonderful experience with kathy. mani (gel shellac) and a deluxe spa pedicure. i wasn't planning on getting anything so fancy, however, once i was settled in my chair and observed how thorough my neighbor's pedicures were i decided to splurge. i'm really glad i did. i got there are around 2:30 (on a saturday) and there wasn't a wait. (it did get crowded around 3:30.) i left incredibly satisfied around 4:30.  my technician was incredibly thorough and gives one of the best nail place massages i've ever had. my nails look great! i can't wait to come back. oh! and i received 10% off my entire bill for checking via yelp. can't beat that kind of a deal.</b_review>

<text>as a bar, monkey pants seems to want it both ways.  they have a 1:00am shirtless shot routine that makes the place feel like an annoying college bar.  at the same time, the atmosphere is decidedly low-key, especially considering the "wacky" and "outrageous" name.  i've been there on a few friday nights and, each time, could count on one hand the number of patrons.  if nobody is going there, it must not just be me.  maybe it's better during lunchtime...  time out lounge is in the same strip-mall.  i'd recommend drinking there instead.</text>
<u_review>yes, lifetime fitness is expensive.  when i joined, i felt that $40/month was a little excessive but appreciated the wealth of amenities i was provided.  i eventually canceled in favor of a cheaper rate at la fitness and have learned that lifetime has raised their monthly dues to an astronomical $50.  if this is true, i can't imagine why anyone would sign up.    sure, the facility is more like a compound in size, but how many people will actually take advantage of everything offered to them?  i used only the cardio equipment, free weights, and basketball courts.  i estimate that most people don't even utilize that much.  if you're the type of person that appreciates pools, water slides, squash, rock climbing, tanning beds, day spas, cafes, an uncountable number of saunas, and watching television in the locker room, then this gym is for you.  me, i just want to work out for 47 minutes, shoot some hoops, and go home.  this gym clearly isn't for everyone, but i guess it's for someone.</u_review>
<u_review>ok, so i moved to the neighborhood recently and finally found the time/energy/will power to go to the gym.  i used to frequent the 48th st/chandler blvd location and am now wishing i still could.  a couple points:  1. there is no towel service.  what gym doesn't have towel service?  i had to drive back home to get one so the person behind me didn't have to bathe in my grossness.  3. they close at 10pm.  this is way too early.  11pm i could understand, but a gym should really be open until midnight.  not only that, but when the lights suddenly went out in the middle of our basketball game, we kept playing because nobody came to tell us to leave.  i only found out the hours after i checked the website at home.  weird!  other than that, it's a gym.  you lift heavy things and run in place.  you wait for a machine.  you feel good about yourself when you go, but you don't go that often.  fortunately, you don't have a contract.</u_review>
<u_review>the pizza is really good. just make sure you're on your a game - like other people have said, there are so. many. rules. i've never caught attitude from an employee, but they've got me terrified.</u_review>
<u_review>valle luna bats .250.  not high enough to put in the middle of the lineup (hell, probably not enough to even start), not low enough to send back down to aaa.  completely average.  i'll admit, however, to frequenting the restaurant primarily for its bar which seemingly promotes about 17,696 drink specials and more on football sundays.  other than that, there isn't really a whole lot to say one way or another.  perhaps that says more than a lengthy review ever could...</u_review>
<b_review>i really didn't know what to think about this place after i heard the name. i was pleasantly surprised when i went in. old style cocktails available as well as ample seating for watching sports. i did get to play ski ball too. definitely a great local bar.</b_review>
<b_review>it doesn't look like much when you walk in, but the staff is friendly, the drinks are inexpensive and if there is karaoke going on it is great fun, even if the dj is a little scattered. almost everyone seemed to know each other, but even being from out of town and not knowing anyone i felt welcome. nice fun dive bar.</b_review>
<b_review>the cheese curds are absolutely amazing. the prices and specials are great. they lost two stars because their service lacks. usually have to ask multiple times for a check, get a lot of "wait what did you all order again?" ask again for the check...again, you get the idea.</b_review>
<b_review>food was almost average couldve been better had hot  wings and fries blah!..service incredibly slow on a friday afternoon,had to take my tab and go find the waittress to cash out.guess cant wrong with the drinks and bottled beer here(only miller and coors on tap).sports on tvs all over gives it 2 stars.......</b_review>

<text>had lunch on a hot sunday.  they are not open but owner will whip up lunch for you while he's prepping the next weeks food.  had pad see ewe - good.  had khao soi (curry noodle soup) - hard to find and often bad -downright awesome, just like i had in chiang mai - turn out owner is from there.  makes authentic nam prik (look it up) if you ask.  damn! right here in chandler, i'm tearing up. going in the rotation for sure.</text>
<u_review>thanks, joe for saving gilbert!  great, casual place like a slimmed down dish urban market (rip).  the pizzas have awesome crusts and without the wait! (take that bianco)  nice place to stop by for a quick bite.  i hope they opne up a grill too.</u_review>
<u_review>we stopped in before a concert.  the food was good, solid fare, nothing too special.  the prices were a bit high.  if i'm in the neighborhood, i'll definitely stop by again.</u_review>
<u_review>we had the sunday brunch.  it includes an entree and a seafood, appetizer, ad dessert  buffet.  the buffet was better than the entrees but everything was very fresh.  drinks are very expensive but what the heck, you're at the biltmore.  it is definitely oooooooold money here.  we loved it. woof!</u_review>
<u_review>the first time i went here, the food was pretty good and i really had no complaints.  the second time - what the heck happened???  the name of the game that night was how much salt can you ingest in one meal before a stroke occurred?  everything was a salt bomb.  especially the seafood pasta where beside the gross, old mussels the only spice i could taste was salt.  the sad part is - i love salt!  i won't go back or recommend it to anyone who has hypertension.</u_review>
<b_review>this place looks a lot worse than it is. the poorly shot photos of their food on their windows and walls do not do them any favors. i wound up eating here by chance when i was bringing back a group of teens to the jcc a few doors down--we had a few minutes for lunch before bringing the rest of the kids back to tucson. most of the kids wound up in the mexican place next door, and seeing as we were pressed for time, i decided that id get some thai food since i love thai. i asked the lady in there if i could get something very quickly to go, she said no problem. i asked if i should get the pad thai or the yellow curry, she said get the yellow curry. so i did. she asked me how hot (and knowing that i had a cold and wanted something kinda spicy, but also momentarily forgetting that i was in a thai restaurant) i told her "make it pretty hot". in retrospect, i might have used a bit more caution with that statement. i also ordered some crab puffs which i know is not authentic, but i was in the mood. the crab puffs turned out to be excellent. just different enough from your standard chinese food arrangement and yet still delicious with their different style dipping sauce. the yellow curry was amazing, albeit a little bit spicier than i would have liked on a normal day...well, actually, it was a freakin inferno...but it felt good to eat it with my cold and all. just be advised ;) would definitely go back next time im in the area. my only complaints were that it took a little bit longer than i would have liked considering my situation, but had i been sitting down it would not have been a problem, and secondly the price was a little high i felt. it was after 3 (so a late lunch, i guess) and wound up having to pay the dinner prices. the two orders, without a drink came to about $15. not terrible, but a little more than i would have liked to pay.</b_review>
<b_review>the tom kha always brings me in, then i have to stay for the drunken noodle and a thai tea! the restaurant is pretty tiny and you can sometimes hear awful karaoke from next door, but the food is worth it. i resorted to thai rama once when my thai craving hit and they were closed, never again...the taste does not even compare. it's never been busy when we go in, so if you're looking for a new thai place give it a shot; i would be heartbroken if they went out of business.</b_review>
<b_review>oh no.... i just ate all the crab puffs. this place makes everything from scratch, even the sweet and sour sauce. the curry is the best around and the pad thai, basil chicken and sweet and sour chicken rocks!  come here and taste the difference. best thai food in chandler!!</b_review>
<b_review>second time here. still like the place. i had the chicken bbq. it was a special not on the menu. the chicken was well marinated and cooked. i feel like the rice could be better, but i am not complaining!  for less than 10$ this place is a steal . very tidy and clean especially considering the price of the food. what's even better is that the chicken is halal!</b_review>

<text>9/3 walked in ten minutes before 6p.  just in time to order a few apps during happy hour!  however, half-priced happy hour apps and beverages were very limited in number and marked with smiley faces, and they were so hard to spot on the menu!  perhaps having only ten minutes to hunt them down exacerbated my difficulty of spotting them, but i hope the managers consider having separate easy-to-read menus printed and used.  liked that martini-drinkers have many martinis to select from. tried a couple of rolls, but i can't recall much to write about except that i would probably come back to try other apps and entrees not on the hh menu, but i'm in no hurry to go back.</text>
<u_review>09/02/10  i've dined a few times at arizona grand's restaurants, many of them now gone (latitude 30 and the phantom horse grill).  the lobby grill is a smaller version of tphg- same furnishings, different location.  i'd have eaten here earlier if i could've found it-- just follow the signs until it seems you've gone too far, and you're almost there!  don't worry about finding parking spaces-- it may look like a long walk, but it's really just around the corner, down the "hill."    there was a little confusion as it seemed that the main dining room was closed and seating was only at the bar, but the host was nice enough to let us sit at a booth; this was a relief, as it looked cold and dark inside the bar, and warm and bright inside the main room.  service was a bit slow, despite the facts that there was only a family of three (one was a toddler) seated before us, and i'd already perused through the menu online-- i knew what i wanted to try!  (oh, how i'd rejoice when the day comes where i can place my order online so that it would be ready to serve when i am seated!)  we ordered the filet bleu cheese pizza and the reinvented waldorf salad.  this order took awhile (35-40 minutes!) to arrive, so it would be in your best interests to bring something to read if you're dining alone, or if the members of your group aren't into small talk.  thankfully, there's a gift shop across the hall!  as far as resort gift shops go, this isn't shabby at all.  it even carries brighton jewelry!  be warned, their inventory doesn't carry the newer items you'll find at the mall.  but i'm not here to talk about silver watches...  i included the prices of our entrees and they were a bit high, but when my mom is willing to overlook the higher costs to have another slice of that wonderful pizza, w/ such tender chunks of filet and pungent bleu cheese (we ate all but a small slice, which i took home and ate for dinner that evening!), or the terrific salad (the candied walnuts were addictive!), then i know i've found a winner of a dining venue!  we'll be back very soon!</u_review>
<u_review>i've tried dining here twice.  the first time i visited, the resto was so packed, i waited ten minutes and then left.  the second time, debated on leaving, but stayed.  had fried chicken, a waffle, cornbread, and the candied yams.  best thing were the yams!  chicken was alright.  waffle was too thin, light in color, and soggy.  it didn't help to witness one of the help sneaking in the back with a bag of bisquick.  i thought the waffles and batter were homemade??  cornbread didn't even compare to redfish or z'tejas!  honestly, it tasted like the dried versions i tried at big city bbq and marie callender's... tsk, tsk.  if i were to return, it would only be for the candied yams/sweet potatoes.  those deserved 5 stars!</u_review>
<u_review>on my first visit here, i ordered #27, which was charbroiled beef, shredded pork, steamed egg, and rice.  the charbroiled beef is excellent- slightly sweet, smoky, and salty; it reminded me of the skewers of barbecued meat i'd eaten as a child in manila (philippines).  the shredded pork was ok, but not something i'd order again.  the steamed egg was delicious!  so good, in fact, that i knew it had to be bad for me.  sure enough, i spied something that looked like it might be finely sliced mushrooms.  indeed, the ingredient was dried mushroom.  so, so tasty, but i soon felt vertigo (a food allergy symptom).  the texture of the rice was also very nice.  very satisfying meal, save the vertigo and the pain that came afterward from the mushroom** :(  one thing i am not looking forward to when dining here is that most of the staff do not speak or understand english.  be sure to look for a short-haired middle-aged woman or a young man in his late teens or early 20's w/ short black hair behind the cash register (i specify only bec. there are many young men with long-ish hair w/ highlights running around).  they can speak and understand english.  the young man is the son of the owners, and he is able to translate your questions to the kitchen staff if he doesn't know the answers himself.  you may order items to go.  i definitely recommend the charbroiled beef* (one pound costs $9.50 plus tax) and the deep-fried cornish hen ($5).  oh my, the cornish hen!!  so delectable, so juicy, so garlicky!!  it comes with extra broth on the side, but you really don't need the broth.  be sure to try the che 3 mau- the vietnamese version of filipino halo-halo.  while halo-halo has many ingredients, including red mung beans, coconut sport strings, ube, jackfruit, leche flan, cooked plantain, palm fruit gel, and tapioca pearls (many combos exist, depending on what you feel like having), com tam's che 3 mau has only two types of beans, crunchy red bean and creamy yellow mung, and green jelly strings (for added texture), and the belle-of-the-ball coconut milk over grated ice.  i order it sans green jelly strings (extra mung beans, please!).  to die for!  what makes the icy dessert beverage so great is the yellow mung bean!  you definitely must try this refreshing drink!  (*i've ordered the beef to go twice, and both times i'm blown away by the flavor and texture of the beef!  however, please note that it's best to let the meat rest for a few minutes before digging in.  otherwise, you'll end up with a lot of sinewy pieces that will end up in the trash, not in your belly.  better yet, refrigerate and eat the beef cold- you can have it over hot rice.  just trust me.  ok, don't trust me, and re-heat those babies.  you'll kick yourself later.)  btw, the restaurant gets its name from the specialty it serves, com tam (broken rice, which i could figure out from the myriad selections that begin with "com tam") and thuan kieu, which i was told was a generic name, sort of like john smith (sounds like "thank you" but take away the "h" sound and say it more like "ten" with a "k" in the end- tenk you).  thank you com tam thuan kieu!!</u_review>
<u_review>had the new roast beef with au jus sandwich.  i was able to sub a caesar salad for the default bottomless fries.  server was friendly and understanding as i had a few questions for her before i could order.    the fourth star was for the complimentary birthday sundae that was waiting for me when i had arrived back from a visit to the restroom.  now why would i rate an extra star for this, you ask?  since i actually paid for the meal with a birthday coupon, i had not expected the complimentary sundae.  quite thoughtful of the server, i thought, and this act garnered her a few more dollars in tips!</u_review>
<b_review>blue wasabi is not your traditional sushi bar. the decor, music and menu are trendy and modern. and if you are wondering, yes they do have blue colored wasabi. now with all that said, if you are more of a traditionalist this place might not appeal to you. you can find some traditional rolls, but most of them are of the "fusion" variety. this restaurant is a decent place to hang out, but i would considerate a "sushi bar". when i cannot order fish using their japanese names it sort of detracts from the ambience of the joint.  also that blue wasabi takes getting used to. overall i would have to say food is ok, nothing special although a little pricey.</b_review>
<b_review>first of all, i thought it was pretty cool that this place actually did have blue wasabi. i went in a group of 6 for happy hour...the rolls and drinks were half off. the sushi was ok, but nothing special. they are also pre-made so you can't order the rolls to fit your liking which for me is important because i dont like crab, and many rolls contain that ingredient.  the service was not very good, but to give our waitress some credit it was crowded and she seemed pretty busy.</b_review>
<b_review>this is the climax of the "wanna-be, uber-cool, all flash no substance sushi chair".  everything is overpriced. the food and drinks are standard at beat. service is unimpressive. there are so many good authentic sushi returants that are owned by families that you should try before this corporate cafeteria. oh and the tables are terrible also.</b_review>
<b_review>3 weak stars for 3 weak specialty rolls.. we tried the "krusty krab", "wango mango", and "me soy horny". dumb names to go with mediocre rolls. the flavors just weren't that great. creative combos, but they just didn't taste that good. sorry! to be fair i did take a chance with the special rolls. i should have stuck with traditional basic rolls because the fish did look appetizing & by no means did it taste bad. the menu offers plenty of non sushi items  so your picky friends "who don't eat raw fish" can join you. i'm a central phoenix kinda gal, but was in the area and of course open to try a new spot. definitely wouldn't hike that way to go again, but would probably give it another chance for the traditional rolls and sashimi if i needed a sushi fix and was in the area.  doubtful that happens!</b_review>

<text>"why is everything i touch sticky?"  that pretty much sums things up for saddle ranch. we sat at the bar for a quick drink before heading in to jobbing.com arena. we were robbed, sweated a bit in the lack of air condition, and got sticky in the process.   also, what's the deal with the plastic cups that are supposed to look like glass? they just look scratched up and dingey. nasty.  for $25 all we got was 1 beer, 1 mixed drink and 2 sad shots. waste of money. go  to the yard house for better beer and atmosphere.</text>
<u_review>my mother, sister and i are annoying. i recognize this and embrace it. we involve shopkeepers, cashiers, janitors, sales associates, servers and anyone else in the near vicinity  in our squabbles and lighthearted  disagreements.   last night's dinner was no different. our server tony was great. he played along and totally made fun of us. we loved it.   highly recommend making a reservation on the weekend as they get very full. i overheard a couple leaving saying there was a 50 minute wait without one.   the drink menu is full of fruity froo-froo drinks but they have plenty of wine choices and full bar for any other drinks. my sister loved her lemon drop martini (ugh) and my hendricks and tonic was damn strong.  we had the stuffed mushrooms to start and they were delicious. loaded with garlic and butter and there were probably 15 of them!  the entrees are good, not amazing. i had the lobster carbonara, which isn't really a true carbonara but it was pretty good otherwise. they put snow peas in it which i find weird, but the lobster pieces were massive. for $20 (the most expensive pasta dish), they had better be!  if you order a 'classic pasta',  you get to choose another order to take home for free! what! that's the weirdest, coolest concept i've seen in a chain restaurant. be prepared to walk out with tons of food.  overall, pleasant experience.</u_review>
<u_review>dog friendly patio!   dude, seriously brah, i love taking my dog riley here to chill on the patio with a beer and a burger. the beer list is extensive with local beers and imports. the burger list is huge! so many choices, or a build your own option. they're served with your choice of tots, sweet potato tots or fries.   i've eaten here twice and both times were great. the patio is a little on the small side, so i try to come during an off time so my dog isn't bothering anyone, she's just way too friendly and nosey. she'd be all up in some lady's tots like "gimme one of your tots!".   if you arent a burger person, although why wouldn't you be?!, they have chicken sandwiches, salads and wings too.   check it out, and look for me and riley on the patio!</u_review>
<u_review>these charming charlie stores are overwhelming with a capital o. the amount of rings, necklaces, purses, earrings, bling, glitz, sparkle, estrogen and pleather is off the charts. thank the gods of accesorizing that they organize everything by color because, holy crap. i wouldn't be able to handle it if everything were jumbled together like a flea market. my head would pop off in a spray of sequins and fake gold links.   i walk up to the cashier with my one little $6 fake gold ring and feel pretty damn proud of myself when she says "that's it?" with a smile on her face.   i'm all... "hell yeah that's it! i almost lost my mind in this place. i'm proud of my one, tiny, insignificant ring. bish."  the ladies working here are comically nice. they're all, "can i help you find anything?" and i'm all, "um... no. unless you found my ocd cowering somewhere on a shelf with the purses and sandals... i'm good."</u_review>
<u_review>i would like to say that i came back to this location yesterday and the nice guy was there this time instead of the condescending jerk face mcassmunch. i actually looked in the store before going in, that's how much i dislike this other guy.  i was there to buy a protein bar, the guy (i really should have asked his name) was very friendly (again) and picked me a great meal replacement bar in the flavor that i wanted.   so i decided to tell him about my horrendous experience and he obviously knew exactly who i was talking about. he agreed that this other guy is a douchetard and knowingly tries to get people to leave the store by intimidating them if they don't want to buy what he's selling. unreal! my new buddy even offered to punch him in the throat for being such a jerk.. now that's romance! disclaimer: we were completely joking and not being serious at all about punching the guy in the throat even though he may completely deserve it.   i'm updating my review a few stars because of this nicer guy. he was apologetic and genuinely felt bad for the way i was treated. the two times i've interacted with him, he's been courteous and helpful. the other guy, however, should seek a different profession.   i'm still not planning on using this store as my primary, but if i see my new buddy working, i'll stop in for a protein bar or something.</u_review>
<b_review>i've been here a few times...love the happy hour! chilie is really good and enough to share...don't bother with the steak!!!</b_review>
<b_review>we made it to saddle ranch a couple of times.  the first time was for dinner on my birthday.  the food and service was very good.    the second time was a few months ago when we had gone to mcfaddens for drinks.  my wife apparently had a few too many 7 and 7's and decided(without my input) that she was going to "ride the bull" at the saddle ranch.  so, we made our way into the bar area and she paid the $3 fee and signed the release papers.  she was then taken to the bull and seated on top, awaiting the beginning of the ride.  i asked the operator to "take it easy on her".  he did not listen or did not care.  the bull started to move and made less than one rotation and she fell off, landing on her back, facing straight up looking at the bull.  i am not sure she knew what happened or how quickly it happened.  needless to say her mechanical bull riding days are over.  hopefully anyways!    this place is worth a visit.  you will have a good time.</b_review>
<b_review>i visited this location a few months back but my experience is still fresh in my memory.  i visited the la location on sunset strip a few years back for drinks...the atmosphere is fun.  i returned in march at the glendale location for dinner with my parents after a white sox spring training game.  we all had steak - which we all enjoyed, even my very picky father who refuses to eat in any kind of "chain" restaurant.  the service was decent as well but go early as this place does get crowded. (we ate the night before at margaritaville also at westgate)  finding a decent place while on vacation can be a difficult task at times but we did well with this place (being from chicago)  it's a decent place to grab a decent dinner or go for drinks and get entertained by those riding the mechanical bull :)</b_review>
<b_review>following my brother's suggestion [he's been here before], about five of us headed out to saddle ranch on a saturday night.  while going through their ridiculous i.d. checking [twice], we finally got our flashing-beeper-thingy.  we waited for about 45 minutes so it wasn't too bad -- after all, it -is- a bar at westgate.  so our table finally opens up and we all sit down.  we had such a friendly and funny waiter.  i had ordered a mojito but apparently they didn't have mint leaves.  damn.  so i had a texas tea and two others ordered their fruity drinks [those guys  -_-;;].  our drinks had arrived in carafes!  after viewing our huuuge drinks [about $12 a pop] and the crazies on the mechanical bull, we all decided to leave after the booze.  maybe it's not my kind of scene but  i definitely didn't like it there.  so the highlight of that saturday night:  denny's.  hah!</b_review>

<text>i've gone to honey bears now twice. first time was when i was a teenager with my grandparents. was not impressed. since it had been st least 15 years, i figured is give out another go. honestly, i've made better bbq at home. for the price they charge you, of rather go to famous daves.   pork was dry. ribs were fatty. cobbler was gluey and tasted like it was comstock pie filling.   thank goodness we ate using a deal chicken offer.</text>
<u_review>time my colleague and i walked into panda - between 12:05-12:10pm time on my receipt - 12:33:26pm    my colleague and i get there to find a line backed up to the door.  now, at the other pe that i've been to (on 40th/thomas), this isn't a problem.  the 40th/thomas location moves people.  this old town/south scottsdale location on the other hand assumes people don't have anywhere to be or that no one that comes in on their lunch hour.  there was plenty of food on the line (at least plenty of what we were going to order) so waiting on the "kitchen" to get out food was not an issue.     we stood in line waiting to get up to the counter.  we stood in line waiting to pay for our food.  there's no excuse for there to be 3 or 4 people on the line jumping over one another to fill orders when there is only 1 person at the cash register.  and about 95% of the time, the person at the cash register was also filing orders.    i think the people that work the food/customer line are in need of training.  cause it was a total cluster-fuck.  and, if a customer's order is on hold cause what they want is being cooked, how about take the people that have a complete order and ring them up and get them out the door.    thank goodness my next work meeting wasn't until 1pm.    i doubt i'll return.</u_review>
<u_review>in a nutshell, if you need to speak to a pharmcist at this location (in person of over the phone), make sure you're dealing with matthew (who is awesome).  eric is not very friendly, and short with people.      5 stars - matthew 0 stars - eric</u_review>
<u_review>i am in a semi-sugar coma while writing this review.....   heading back to work from an ajs salad bar lunch run, i mention to my 2 colleagues, "wanna get a free sprinkles cupcake?" they both say sure as we pass through the light at camelback. the driver proceeds to make a u-turn (an illegal one at that) and we head back north up scottsdale road. providing there had been a cop witnessing the law being broken, that free cupcake wouldn't have been free after all.   now, i having only had sprinkles (red velvet) once, my original opinion was unfavorable. i made the cardinal mistake of putting my purchased cupcake in the fridge. big no no! after trying the dried out cupcake, i wondered why anyone would spend over $3.00 on a cupcake!   with the whisper word in hand, i figured why not give them another try! its free after all! so my coworkers and i head inside. the smell upon entry is heavenly. we say the magic word "90210" and get our free vanilla cupcakes.   after eating my cupcake, i have to say that the frosting was awesome! almost a little too sweet for me, but the flavor was excellent! the cake however was a little off. it smelled and tasted of cornbread! i immediately start thinking about beans (my gram used to make cornbread and beans a lot when i was growing up, which i hated!) and can not eat anymore. even my coworkers said it had a cornbread taste to it. very strange! i ate the "muffin top" and gave the rest of it away to a friend in another department who coincidentally does not like frosting. worked out perfectly.   will i try sprinkles again? most likely. but only if i can get another one free. hopefully they'll have a whisper word for the cinnamon sugar one, cause it looked awesome in the case! the guy at sprinkles said it reminds him of a churro. sounds good to me!!   so 5 stars for free. 3 stars for the cake part tasting like cornbread. averages out to 4.   ps - i think i've met my sugar quota for the day. ugh</u_review>
<u_review>stopped by this fud location on our way up to the anthem outlets last night.  j had a free birthday burger coming to him.    we were informed that the coupon only covered a basic burger.  no cheese..nada.  and that toppings were à la carte.  so if you wanted to order a inferno burger, you had to pay for the cheese, jalapenos, and whatever else comes on it that you cant get at the toppings bar.  $1 a piece.    i got a 1/3 lb burger (1/3 is unfortunately the smallest you can order..i seem to remember ordering a 1/4 at the tempe location for my birthday in feb..maybe i'm mistaken. *shrug*) with satueed onions and blue cheese.  the burger was cooked to my liking, which was a plus.  and they didnt chince on the onions or blue cheese.  the fries were maybe luke warm, at best.    one of the positive things about dinner last night -  monday's all kids meals are only 99cents.  baby c enjoed his grilled chicken sandwich.  the chicken seemed on the small side as it did not take up the whole bun.  i tossed away most of the bun cause i didnt want him having all that bread.   it came with fries or fruit, and i got him fruit.  what came was half an apple, sliced.  coulda gotten that at home.  *shrug*  at least baby c's meal was only 99cents.</u_review>
<b_review>i like the sauce here a little better than bbq company.  this is a little more vinegar while bbq co is sweeter.  the pulled pork sandwich at lunch is one of my favorites.</b_review>
<b_review>not too impressed. the baked beans were way too sweet as is the bbq sauce. so-so cole slaw and dry meat.</b_review>
<b_review>went here saturday after a long absence and was reminded why there has been such a long absence.  the food was mediocre and the facility is pretty run down.  i had the bbq pork, coleslaw and peach cobbler while my wife had the bbq pork and potato salad. we both thought the bbq pork was a 3 or 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 and the coleslaw and potato salad were no better.  i was so looking forward to the peach cobbler but even it wasn't very good.   if you're in the area and want good bbq go two minutes away to hap's bbq on washington and 48th.  of course joe's bbq in gilbert is great too and even famous dave's kicks this place.</b_review>
<b_review>the guy at the cashier was very chill and friendly.   we ordered the value meal with 3 pieces of ribs, pulled pork sandwich plus a side of mac  & cheese. the bbq sauce was goood. the ribs were good too but i just hiked squaw peak for the first time when i went there so i was really really exhausted and hungry that i'd pretty much eat anything. so, i'm not sure. it's worth a try though!  by the way, thanks to yelp we got $2 off! we also ordered peach cobbler and sweet potato pie for dessert, and they were delicious!  will we visit again? for sure!</b_review>

<text>the dirty rice and boudin at baby kay's are really quite wonderful - a local treasure in phoenix. baby kay's and papadeaux's take the prize for cajun restaurants so far in phoenix, with good food at reasonable prices. the lunch is a little pricier here - and so i recommend baby kay's for dinner because it's the same price. but hey if greekfest across the street is full for lunch, pop over to baby kay's. the food is consisistently good - gumbo, jambalaya and oyster po-boy. highly recommended.</text>
<u_review>chloe's is an excellent place for a quick and casual lunch in north scottsdale. located in kierland commons, it has an old style counter behind which the magical grilled sandwiches are prepared. the tuna sandwich and the tuna melt are both very good. the best thing about chloe's is that it's simply good, clean and has 50 cent coffee - with free refills. tough to beat - one of the best, clean, tasty and easy in-and-out lunch places around.</u_review>
<u_review>it's an interesting mix of opinions posted about chino bandito. frankly on my first visit i wasn't sure what to think. on my next visit i was hooked.  whenever i find myself near the 17 and greenway i'm thinking about stopping by for eat-in or take-out.  chino bandido is definitely a funky place as everyone says. it's in a not so fancy strip mall with not so fancy decor inside. but look past it and you'll have some fun. even though it's kind of funky i did find it to be clean - and i'm extremely finicky about cleanliness.  some of the menu winners include the #13 pollo diablo, which delights with garlic and hot peppers. besides that the #10 emerald chicken has a wonderful flavoring including ginger that is well-teamed with the jerk fried rice. enjoy the hot sauce and interesting mix of flavors.  i also like the chocolate volcano which is only available on certain days.  yes it is an odd mix of mexican, chinese and caribbean flavors, but it works. chino bandito is very inexpensive and highly recommended. just keep an open mind.</u_review>
<u_review>i've been passing lao thai on scottsdale road in south scottsdale for years and finally stopped by. it doesn't look like much outside, and it's not a whole lot better inside, but i was pleasantly surprised by the food and service. i had the pad thai - delicate, spicy and delicious. the service was friendly, and my eating mates were all pleased with their food especially the spicy lemongrass - which i want to try next time. excellent - don't judge a book by the cover.</u_review>
<u_review>shinbay is a step above roka akor - and reminded me more of walking down a tokyo street and dashing in for a creative culinary adventure. we nearly ordered everything on the menu and were delighted at every turn, starting with house made tofu, through a perfectly seasoned and textured black cod, to fresh and thoughtful sushi, tempura to die for, a steamed mushroom dish, a seafood sampler that included a fresh kumamoto oyster with sea urchin, and finishing up with custard dessert styled from okinawa. every dish was something we had never seen prepared that way. get the chef's course or do what we did - order a variety of dishes off the menu, which for us cost about $75 per person (with a couple drinks each) versus the $125 (or so) chef's course that the house recommend. either way, if you appreciate creative and fresh japanese food, you will be in heaven.</u_review>
<b_review>my boyfriend and i are both from louisiana so we were excited to try baby kay's. we both had the bloody mary which were spicy and full of veggies which we loved. he got the shrimp po-boy and i got the veggie étouffée. both were quite good. on our second visit he got the sampler which he was less impressed with. next time we'll stick with the poboy! no vegan options unless you are in the mood for a salad.</b_review>
<b_review>i love baby kay's like pirates love stealing. it's good enough to wipe clean the memory of taking a horrible girlfriend there for our first date. the craw fish ettouffe is something i have to stop to contemplate each bite of because i struggle to comprehend why it's so delicious. the gumbo and jambalaya are also stellar. i like to merge all three in the cajun combination.   they make a raspberry vinaigrette there that deserves it's own paragraph and is mandatory on your dinner salad.   another fantastic creation here is the apricot habenero glaze that one would think would over-power a chicken salad, not the case. now i know most of you see the h-word and imagine terrible pain, this dish is not prohibitively hot, it manages to catch the flavor of the much maligned pepper and only a fraction of its fire.    if you happen upon baby kay's  on a day when the special is seafood enchiladas, get them and call me for a refund if you anything less than amazed.    staff is pretty low key and nice here. not a good call if you're in a hurry, but worth being late over. i usually sit at the bar if minutes are precious and outside if my time is my own. for what you get the prices are very reasonable.</b_review>
<b_review>this has become one of my favorite local spots. i got take-out here once a year or so ago, but wanting to use our entertainment book coupons, we came twice recently. we dined in the last two times and really enjoyed our meals. the service is attentive and friendly and the atmosphere is very chill and low-key. last night (thursday), there was a blues performer alternating between his violin and guitar.   i have been to new orleans many times and having lived in the florida panhandle, i love, love love, anything with crawfish. boy, do they do it right with their crawfish etouffee! fair warning that their food can be spicy but that is typical with that food genre. i have had their seafood gumbo (chunky, spicy goodness), jambalaya, fried catfish, fried shrimp....everything is very good. i particularly love their hushpuppies with the spicy remoulade sauce. you can tell it has a lot of horseradish in it, which i love.   they also have great mixed drinks (my favorite is the creamsicle) and they have a good selection of louisiana beers. i honestly think this restaurant is a great representation of cajun style food and feel lucky to have it my hood!</b_review>
<b_review>as a new orleans native, i am going to hold any "cajun" restaurant to the highest standard. 3 stars in this case is actually a huge compliment from me because i expect a lot when ordering this kind of food.   i had the shrimp po boy and seafood gumbo...i have to say, both were quite tasty. is the po boy equivalent to my favorite place in nola? of course not - the bread would be slightly different, and the lettuce should be shredded. does it do the trick for a quick fix? absolutely. the seafood gumbo was actually pretty delicious as well - i was impressed with that dish for sure. someone at my table ordered jambalaya, and he said he loved it...but my husband's looks a lot more appetizing.  i will definitely come back here during crawfish season to see what that's like....depending on how well they do that, i might even add a star. the service is friendly but a little slow.  this place is not the nicest restaurant or the nicest ambiance, so don't come here expecting a 5 star experience. however, it does a pretty damn good job of making a native new orleans girl feel slightly at home in this crazy desert. i had a positive experience and am eager to check out some more of what baby kay's has to offer.</b_review>

<text>service here sucks. i love the food still.  but the service is so bad, i never want to come back. honestly.  sorry zinc, ya'll need to get new servers or some shit.  awful service. awful management.</text>
<u_review>not the best not the worst  i'd go back  i got the sunrise sampler breakfast meal  the biscuits were great! the gravy was a little bland and old-people foodish the eggs were buttery i didn't care for the bacon, ham or sausage cheesey potatoes were great! grits... yucky.  so all in all... i'd go back, i just wouldn't rush back.</u_review>
<u_review>it was good. but the menu was very limited, and while i can appreciate a small menu... this one just didn't have much that i was interested in.  so i ended up ordering the bacon sandwich, which was delicious... but.  it's just not my cup o tea. i looked over the menu... then looked over it some more.... and it was one of the first times i thought "meh" ....  usually at a restaurant i want to order like 5 different things because i get so excited.  so i was pretty disappointed that i didn't see one thing that i thought sounded exciting.  i wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, no no.</u_review>
<u_review>i thought this place was fun found the food to be very heavy  i got the buffalo burger with the recommended preparation and a beef burger with cheese and foie gras!  the foie gras was just ok.  they overly pan seared it.  but hey, $6 for foie gras is ok in my book.  the sides were great though.  loves the sweet potato fries, tater tots and mac and cheese.  loved them.  more than the burgers.  so yeah, i thought it was fun.  don't know if i'd go on a regular basis, but whatev.  i liked it better than delux anyday....</u_review>
<u_review>errrr..... i'm 29 and i felt way too young on a friday night here at 10pm.  i'll wait ten years, then come back.  ps.  i had the pork sliders with sweet potato fries, and it was all delicious and reasonably priced.</u_review>
<b_review>i really like the atmosphere at zinc bistro, and it has wonderful outdoor seating (unfortunately it was all taken).  french onion soup ($10):  i'm a sucker for fos, and it's pretty much a guarantee i'll order it if it's on the menu.  for $10, i had high expectations, but sadly they were not met.  there was just a little too much vermouth for my liking.  crispy duck confit sandwich ($12):  now this was a winner.  crispy duck, garlic aioli, and onions...yum!  picture:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2lp2q37fzgh__feb-vrlig&userid=wmlaiomjm-y8euwz_edjla  our waiter talked us into getting this "amazing" fries and went on for a couple minutes about how they make them and what not.  i thought they were average at best. *shrugs*</b_review>
<b_review>my boyfriend chose zinc bistro for a friday date night spot for two reasons. 1: the quaint kierland location and 2: the mussels appetizer. he was right about both.   the mussels were divine... dipping the bread into the tangy juice followed by a glass of merlot was just heavenly. if our meal ended there i would be back in a heartbeat.   i did not care for the dish i ordered. at first glance the crusted black sea bass sounded perfect but i soon remembered the reason why i avoid the daily specials. shame on me. the bass was tasty but the mushrooms and endives did not pair well with the fish. separately, these three would be a delight. but something was off and the flavors just did not blend.   the boyfriend was happy with his filet topped with a generous portion of foie gras. two bites of his rich meal with the side of mac and cheese made up for my lackluster entree. if we try zinc again i'll be sure to ask for recommendations.</b_review>
<b_review>approaching zb for a sunny february lunch i was struck by the crowd at the tables outside seemingly trying their upmost to convince themselves they were in st tropez and not the keirland commons shopping mall. it was such a motley crue of burberry wearing benz drivers that it was quite an effort not to burst out laughing. needless to say i asked for a table inside!  greeted by a surly host we were shown to a table for two which in classic bistro style was on the small side but it wasn't a busy thursday so we had plenty of space. zb has done a good job with the recreation of french bistro decor but you had the feeling it was more american french than french french. as if they had been to bourdain's les halles in new york and tried their best to recreate the look and feel of his authentic bistro.   i ordered moules marieniere with stringier then usual shoestring fries (frankly they were so thin they were worthless). the mussels were tasty and the buttery white wine sauce has a nice kick to it and stood up well to bread dipping at the end of the meal. the mussels themselves were a little rubbery but if you order seafood in the desert i always think you have to be forgiving.  my fellow diner ordered a burger and the small taste i had was a delight, one of the best tasting burgers in some time and a nice lunch size, not huge so you wouldn't be weighed down for the rest of the day.  this was my second visit to zb. last time i ordered a really unimpressive duck confit sandwich and so i was hoping it would be a better experience all round this time, sadly not ... should a burger be the thing that impresses you most at a french bistro?  this joint is a classic example of having the look but not delivering the product. french bistro food should be fresh and simple but my second time here delivered just an 'ok' dining experience. small things like the waitress pronouncing the 's' on moules and the wine menu offering george duboeuf 'morgan' when the wine is actually a 'morgon'. if you are going to attempt french authenticity you should make sure the details are correct.  the final reason i won't be back was when i turned round and saw the same surly hostess taking her shoe off and rubbing her foot before putting it back on and handling menus.  non merci.</b_review>
<b_review>my wife and i went here for dinner last night.  it was a monday night at 8pm and the place was not too busy at all.  there were only 3 or 4 other parties in the place so we were seated quickly.  the decor of the place is actually pretty neat.  i got the "france" vibe even though i've never been there before.  it also goes without saying that i'm not super experienced in the ways of french cuisine.  while almost everything on the menu looks decent and pretty unique to my american eyes, but my wife and i decided to try something simple.  we split the flat iron steak.  it was very good and perfect to share.  we also shared the truffle and parmesan fries and they were awesome.  i also had the iceberg salad to start and it was unique and delicious.  i would get it again.  i know, i know - i didn't go all out and order some hardcore french cuisine.  next time i come i promise i will be more adventurous.  the service was friendly but a bit off.  our waiter asked if my wife wanted more wine which she declined because she had 1/2 a glass left.  when her glass was finished, they took it away and didn't ask if she wanted another to accompany her entree (which she would have liked).  also, a half hour went by after our salads until our entree came and there was no sign of our waiter who seemed to abandon us.  the place was almost dead by now so it was odd.  all-in-all it is an ok place and i would return.  i'm not sure if i'm going to rush back but i'm not crossing it off my list just yet.</b_review>

<text>if you are looking for an old fashioned ice cream parlor this is the spot.  the food is also old school diner type food, the meatloaf is pretty good, but it is meatloaf after all, not a porterhouse steak.  the desserts are rich and the ice cream is decent, wish they would have more flavors though.  the servers are mostly young high school age kids who sometime spend too much time talking with their friends.  it is what it is.</text>
<u_review>got talked into going twice to give it a second chance by some beer lovers.  stayed away from the seafood this time and enjoyed a nice cheeseburger, not super huge but very tasty. service was better as the place was not busy as before. the beers will still need to improve for the long haul to compete with other brew pubs but the food was a big improvement over this past weekend. stay away from the seafood and you should be safe.</u_review>
<u_review>since i haven't been to the midwest full menu places i can't compare but base this review solely on my visit.  it was dead in the place being asu was on break.  food menu is pretty limited but the prices were fair. was disappointed in the milk shake as it was rather plain. had the guacomole burger and it was ok also. i'm knocking it down from 4 stars to 3 because the place was dirty.  all the tables looked like they hadn't been wiped down all day, and like i said the place was empty so no excuse for having a dirty restaurant.</u_review>
<u_review>even if the decor is from ikea the food is anything but ikea. really eclectic mix of scandavian, polish and canadian food. desserts are wonderful. huge portions and dirt cheap prices. shhh, don't tell them they can easily charge more. if they were in a real sit down restaurant and not a strip mall fast food locale they could charge twice as much and still be considered cheap.  all food is handmade and should remind you of what grandma used to make for you from the old country.</u_review>
<u_review>if you aren't easy big greasy cheeseburgers, cold beer and hot waitresses who really turn on the charm then stay away from this place.  it isn't for those with weak stomaches and narrow minded chain driven people.  a little bit pricey but well worth it.</u_review>
<b_review>ah, sunday morning... okay, sunday afternoon.  i wake up slightly hungover with a desperate need for water and realize that i am not alone.  my best friend spent the night because she was in no shape to drive home and she is still passed out in my bed.  i nudge her and say, "time to get up and i'm pretty sure we missed yoga."  we always promise each other that we will make it to the gym for a yoga class on sunday, but we never do.    fast forward to us squinting into the sun as we drive up scottsdale road looking for something to eat.  i spot the sugar bowl and flashback to fond childhood memories of drinking chocolate malts in my dance uniform.  i always went here after dance recitals and that may have been why i went through this really awkward chubby stage in 4th grade.   anyhow, my friend thought the sugar bowl sounded good too.   we park our butts in a seat and order broccoli cheese soup, of course i got the aforementioned chocolate malt too.  the soup was seriously good.  it was creamy and satisfying.  the chocolate malt was as good as i remembered.  they don't exactly compliment each other though, so maybe next time i will go with the tea sandwiches.</b_review>
<b_review>craving something sweet, but tired of the usual small ice cream shops? then i would recommend the sugar bowl in down town scottsdale. step back in time into a pink ice cream parlor with a soda fountain and a huge menu full of ice cream treats. the sugar bowl offers pretty much anything that you can do with ice cream, including fantastic sparkling ice capades! in case you are wondering what a sparkling ice capade is, it's sherbert blended with sprite and the end result tastes like a push pop shake! the sugar bowl is almost always full of people, usually a blend of tourists and locals, but i have never had to wait to long to get a table. also on the weekends they usually have a balloon artist walking around making whatever you please. i would recommend the balloon hats. so whether you are walking around the art galleries in old town scottsdale  or hitting up the nightlife for a fun detour try the sugar bowl!</b_review>
<b_review>i've been living locally the past 14 years and didn't try the sugar bowl until just last night. i love that you can sit at a table and be helped by a server just for dessert. the menu was full of classics and different concoctions of ice creams, sauces, and other sweets--the hardest part of our visit there was making a decision. i opted for the buster brownie (sub out the chocolate for caramel), my boyfriend enjoyed the top hat sundae and omg--yumbo.   overall this place has the right price, impressive dessert, and a super cute atmosphere. great date night spot for old town scottsdale.</b_review>
<b_review>walking into the sugar bowl is like stepping back in time to my grandparent's kitchen.  i have never eaten anything here besides desserts, but, sweet sassy molassy, they make great ice cream sundaes!  satisfy your sweet tooth here.</b_review>

<text>the salsa they hand you with the chips tastes like, i don't know, agent orange?  it doesn't taste good.  my tostada was swimming in a pool of grease.  my enchilada was decent.  the taco i had gave off an aftertaste that was remarkably similar to a fart.  it had a crunchy shell that can cut up your gums.  goddamn, everyone who works here is so nice.  i feel bad giving it two stars but the food was really, honestly, not very good.  i am not a picky eater, really.  i am easy to please.  if i tell you a place has lousy food, then man, you are gonna shit your pants.</text>
<u_review>i stopped into the horse and hound to wet my whistle one night before i saw a show at the clubhouse next door.  i looked around and i thought that the décor was alright, it was a little tacky but i like to have my bars a little on the tacky side.  keeps shit edgy.  i saw that they had shuffleboard there and virtual bowling.  everything looked quite promising.      i started off with a vodka and red bull.  the drink was watery, but i didn't mind too much because i seem to remember it was pretty inexpensive.  i played me some virtual bowling and discovered that the trick to do well is to put the least amount of effort into the game as possible.  once you start caring is when you start fucking up.  all night, i was determined to have a good time, dammit.  i don't like not liking places.  i can overlook shit.  bathroom smells funny?  that's okay.  vomit on the light switch?  kind'a gross, but okay.  but the bartending staff was so rude to me that it was ridiculous.  it felt to me as though i was not welcome there.  my friends and i asked this one middle-aged lady bartender where the discs to play shuffleboard were and she said, "well, did ya look over there?"  i don't mean like, "oh, did you look over there?"  i mean, balls out, nasty, "did ya look over there?" with the same offended gestures you might expect from someone if you'd just asked them if they bleach their butthole.  in truth, no, no we didn't look over there; we decided to ask first due to our geographic location being situated closest to the bar at the time.  big goddamn deal, just answer the question.  i was gonna get a drink but realized that i was standing under a sign that read:  "do not stand here!  your order will not be taken!"  how inviting.  once my drink was finished i asked the bartender if i could have another drink.  i tapped my glass and asked if i could have "another one of these," to which she replied, "what's another one'a these?" with the shittiest tone of voice you can muster and her head indignantly shaking at me like i just spit in her face.  every bar i've ever been to, my bartender knows what drink i had last.  if they don't know, they ask me and they're nice about it.  bartenders are supposed to be nice, for god's sake.  i was also pretty high as i had only moments before smoked a ton of pot and that was a major buzzkill for me.  nothing un-highs me like someone being completely unreasonable.    if i would take more than two seconds to order, i would get an audible, raspy sigh.  "hi, could i get... hmmm..." *gaaaawwwwwwww!!* perhaps it's better on different night.  i don't know.  i'm not real anxious about coming back.  instead of being shitty, treat me like a human being.  i'm like the easiest customer you can get, so to be shitty is really lame.  i've never given back a burger, never complained about a drink and kept my lips zipped that time i found a dead rat in my fries.</u_review>
<u_review>ahhh.... the stab lab.  this was a sad, sad, sad time in my life.  i've got the plasma scars to prove it.  someone once asked me if i had ever been involved with heroin because of the scar tissue bunched up on my veins.  i can't say i ever had a "pleasant" experience donating plasma.  i give this place four stars because it saved my ass, not because it was a magnificent way to spend my saturday.  when i didn't have money for food, this place gave me money for food.  i'd stock up on mac & cheese, buy a pack of smokes and two forties.  i was good to go, man.  you go in, they prick your finger and get blood out of it, then you lay down on a bed in the back and they stick a spike (not a needle), a friggin' spike into your arm and you pump and pump until all this blood comes out.  they spin the blood in this machine until clear, water-lookin' liquid comes out--that's your plasma--and they put the blood back into your body.  all the while, they have a movie playing for you, usually a movie you would never consider renting, something like monster in law or hitch or the great mouse detective or something.  at the very end of the ordeal, they replace your plasma with saline.  i can only describe that feeling as getting injected with mentholated blood.  your mouth gets all cold and you feel a little sick.  but hey, you just scored out on some hard, non-taxable cash, so the feeling fades once you walk around for a little bit.  the people you meet there, you are not likely to forget.  you will always have a story to tell your friends after a day of getting stabbed.</u_review>
<u_review>i love having hotels close by in my own city that are nice.  sometimes you just don't feel like falling asleep at your own house.  so, make it a date night and get comfortably drunk without having to worry about driving home and killing a line of cute baby ducks or hopping on a bus with a bladder full of beer-induced urine.  the property itself is, of course, very, very nice and big and sprawling.  the rooms are pretty nice themselves.  even if a suite is small, i always enjoy having a separated living area and sleeping area.  it really doesn't do much for a lot of people aesthetically, but i love it.  even if it's the size of a regular room, i just enjoy having that segregated living area with a couch and a tv.  the ballrooms and the meeting spaces are all uniformly gorgeous.  if you're hosting a corporate even and need to have dining arranged for a couple hundred attendees, this place is just about perfect for it.  of course, i have my complaints.  some of the decor around the property is beyond cheesy.  some of the columns and other decorations looks like they're made out of a reinforced paper mache.  the tv's you get in your room are really, really crappy.  like, if my tv at home is better, it's gotta be pretty shitty because my tv at home is pretty damn shitty.  if you have a kid and you want them to be distracted, you're gonna have to get those fuckers pretty pickled because i think the most technologically advanced gaming they have is a game cube and the games are expensive as hell to rent.  because it's a resort, expect to pay a buttfuck load of money.  a cup of coffee with your breakfast is like $4.25.  jesus fucknuts.  pretty serious shit.  overall, if you're offered a reasonable rate for a room here, it's worth it.  there's a 21+ swimming pool--no kids.  ahhhh it's sweet.  there's a waterpark, too and the waterpark has a bar so if you don't have the guts to conquer the tall slide, take a shot of their cheapest tequila and see what you're made of.  the customer service here, i thought, was really awesome.  everyone was so nice.  they must have decent management because i used to work at a resort and everyone who worked at that one was in a bad mood all the time.</u_review>
<u_review>you can't browse a yelp talk-thread without hearing mention of fez.  you hear fez is amazing.  you hear fez is overrated.  i decided to kind of zone out what everyone had been saying and try it for myself and see what i thought.  my friend came in from out of town and i wanted to take him somewhere sort of out of the way.  just to show him around.  we ate at a few places close by, but i wanted him to get a full-on phoenix experience.  it was brutally hot out that day, too so i wanted to show him, basically, that phoenix isn't necessarily the devil's armpit.  there's cool stuff, too.  to make it complete, we took the light rail there.  it was a strange journey getting there.  first, the goddamn kiosk fucked me out of two tickets.  i paid for 'em but i didn't get 'em spit out.  i told a light rail security guard and he just said, "drop my name..." if asked to show my ticket.  seemed dubious, but i never got asked to show my ticket so it sort of worked out.  then, once on the light rail, this annoying drunk dude and drunk chick were being totally belligerent.  they wanted to know somewhere fun to go.  every place i dropped, they were like, "we're not going there!  we don't want to go there!  that's not what we're doing!  what the fuck?!" and started to really get on my nerves.  i finally told 'em i wasn't their tour guide and to piss off... especially if you're gonna be rude about it.  finally, we got to fez and i was like, "man... i'm sorry that it's super hot and drunk people are being bitches."  we got in and it was pretty great right away.  immediate seating and it was super air conditioned and i could feel my sanity slowly pump back into my brain.    i order the burger that's loaded with mushrooms and it was very, very good.  everyone says to try the sweet potato fries.  sorry, but i skipped.  i'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but i did have their spicy fries and those little fuckers were amazing.  our waiter was so attentive and awesome and willing to bullshit with us, it made the experience a whole lot nicer, balancing out the oddness of the day that preceeded.  i always have to mention a restaurant's bathroom.  i love it when they decide to make the can a place to enjoy.  fez's bathroom was amazing.  dessert was amazing.  brownie covered in ice-cream.  i wanted to marry it, but my dad would freak out and my mom.... she'd just sit there.  based on my experience, it's a nice place to go and i would definitely go again, just to try their different burgers and maybe test the waters with their lamb plate.    it's not expensive and it really is delicious.</u_review>
<b_review>i can't believe this place has 3.5 stars. what a disappointment! the food was bland and cold, the service was ok but my husband and i will certainly never return. terrible</b_review>
<b_review>authentic mexican food in the heart of bustling downtown tempe. service was good and they gave us more chips when we asked for them (sign said only one per table.) try the chimichanga if you're into the that- mix it up & don't feel you have to rely on the meals to construct a tasty plate.</b_review>
<b_review>my boyfriend and his family personally know the people who run this place and have been regulars here for years. given that i am half mexican (raised on tex mex and sonoran mexican food), i tend to be more on the picky side when it comes to branching out and trying different regions of mexican food. so my first time here i was a little on edge... it's definitely a different style than what i'm used to.  this is not your generic mexican food (carols o'brien's, macayos, chevy's, manuel's), this is authentic. if you're used to spice and flavor complexity, this is a milder, more bland (not in a bad way) mexican joint. they use more green sauces as opposed to red, and queso fresco (white, crubmly, look it up) as opposed to cheddar or american. for those who can't handle a lot of spicy - this is probably the place for you.  while it's not what i'm used to i really enjoy their food. the waiters really make you feel at home. it's a great place for a family dinner with options on the menu for everyone.</b_review>
<b_review>i give this place 4.25 for being extremely cheap yet amazingly delicious! this is not your normal taco bell, filiberto kind of mexican food. according to my friend (who's actually from mexico), this restaurant offers "mexico city food.... southern mexican food" my fav is #4. it's small but enough to fill you up for lunch. their spicy, juicy shredded beef in the flour tortilla is to die for! and their beans and rice are definitely the best in tempe! one of the best place for food on mill.</b_review>

<text>me want to likey likey but no can do.   i'm disappointed in this place and the 4-star rating it got. how misleading. i should have known this place was no good when i didn't see a single thai person in the joint. don't tell me they were all in the back cooking either. its like walking into a mexican restaurant and all the wait staff were chinese. well... now its sounding like chinobandito. anway--- i digress.  i came in for lunch and the menu was expansive! i've never seen so many words that begin with k.  i wanted to try something different than my regular pad thai, curry, tom yum but i couldn't decide and went off something from their lunch menu. i think it was thai bbq chicken with spicy sauce. i figured, i can't go wrong with that. not traditional thai but i couldn't make up my mind about the others.   well, they ran out. i wasn't sure if they ran out of thai bbq or chicken. apparently its bbq so i settled for the sesame chicken. bad idea. when in thai- i should probably order thai... but... um.. how do you screw up sesame chicken? the panda express has mastered it! now you!  it will be a while before i try this place out again but i just didn't expect them to not be able to cook. i will start at a one-star for now and promise to order an authentic dish next time so i can be a better judge.  i did have the thai milk tea and that was good. so one-star for good tea!</text>
<u_review>why the hell does everyone have stuffed animals?!  apparently, they give you a stuffed animal after taking your order so when you're seated, they know what table to deliver the food to. i thought it was a just a nice gesture so i said 'no thanks' to the dirty stuffed animal. then i wondered why the food never came.  chuy's reminds me of the surf n' turf taco shops by the beach. i like the meat and seafood options and especially the smell of grilled food but the flavor could use a lot more spice. the menu was expansive and offered a lot. too much to list and i think they even have fried chicken? weird.   i ordered the broiled whitefish taco platter ($6) with a side of shrimp skewers ($4). the shrimp skewer was awesome, sprinkled some lemon juice on it with some hot sauce and that was a better meal than my taco platter. the fish didn't taste 'fresh" and i'm not exactly sure what whitefish is either. the rice and beans were standard. the cabbage salad could use some help. it was chopped cabbage with a vinaigrette.   i was not impressed by chuy's but i could go there again. it's a safe option, maybe next time i should try their $2 margaritas that they serve all day, every day. now we're talking!</u_review>
<u_review>gotta try the philly cheesesteak wit wiz. yup- cheez whiz, the orange stuff from a can. it's a bit salty for my taste but not bad. i came here for lunch and against my better judgment, i went with the 6 inch....  go for the foot long! (that's what she said.)   i also wished they gave me more fries with my meal, those are good. as i was leaving, there was an after 4 pm special so it may be worth trying after dark because unless you want to spend about $8 on a so-so philly cheesesteak sandwich, then go for it.   overall, i would go again but not excitedly.</u_review>
<u_review>johnnie's deflowered me with their chicago dog.   i was a virgin to chicago style hot dogs until johnnie's. z pizza was getting boring and i was interested in trying something new. i was kind of skeptical  from the moment i walked into the store. it was dark and not crowded considering how it was lunch time.   then i was greeted by a korean dude and thought, "oh boy, korean hot dogs... this should be interesting." but he was actually really nice. i wasn't exactly how to order so i just asked him to give me one with everything.  after he was done, i unwrapped my dog to find a shit-ton of toppings. onions, tomatoes, pickles, peppers, mustard... all on a poppy seed bun. i heard it was sacrilegious to put ketchup on a chicago dog so i didn't but it certainly didn't need it. the hot dog was awesome and i finished it fast, so fast that i don't think i gave my stomach enough time to figure out that i'm full. hence, the reason why i have an eating disorder.  i ordered another one and this one took a bit longer to finish but i don't like leaving things unfinished, especially food, so down it goes, into my belly.   it wasn't until years later that i finally made it to chicago and had lots of chicago dogs there. now that was the real deal.</u_review>
<u_review>the giant horse scared me! i thought it was a real stuffed horse at first glance.  on a nice summer night, we weren't able to get a seat outside because there was a graduation party going on. instead we sat inside and listened to the michael buble-ish croonster and his homeless sidekick. i'm not sure if he was homeless but he was rocking on the bass guitar and would add in his "oh yeahs" and "uh huhs" during an intense jam session. it was creepy and cute.  my friend bought the table a round of marachino cherries that are laced with vodka and cinnamon rum. it was interesting but way too strong for my tastes.  i started with an oak creek hefe which was warm so the server brought me frosty mug but that didn't help either. i ordered the spicy cajun sausage appetizer and it was nothing more than a bowl of sliced sausage links floating in a cold hot sauce. it was disgusting. i had to ask the server if the appetizer was meant to be cold. i'm just not a fan of cold sausage. the best part of my meal was the sourdough bread- and it was damn good because i was starving!  oh yeah- the bathroom was pretty scary. i liked the mops and brooms in there too, really made me feel like i was peeing inside a janitor's closet. oh wait-- maybe it was!</u_review>
<b_review>i tried thai lahna tonight after my metta yoga session next door with fellow yoga enthusiast steve s. it was a little after 7 and thai lahna was pleasantly empty. you know, there were a handful of diners enjoying their meals but the small storefront was still quiet and servers meandered around checking in on guests and greeting us when we stepped in. i thought the decor was impressive in that it was actually thai, not just generic asian like other thai places i've been to. steve agreed that it was "thai-ed together" well.  sigh.  the menu reads like a novella, but of course i only have to flip to the vegetarian page. there were two or three appealing veg options but the rest seemed pretty bland; noodles with vegetables, broth with vegetables, white rice with vegetables. i went for #93 the steamed tofu with...white rice and vegetables, with a 'light soy' sauce. my dining companion ordered #41, a shrimp and veg entree.  service was quick and both the servers seemed friendly enough, and pretty quick with the water refills and ice spill disasters. i thought my dinner was decent with a standard mix of veggies, but seasoning wise found it basically salty and surprisingly oily. i wasn't expecting a spice explosion but sodium alone doesn't do it for me. i would like to come back and to try a few apps or other vegetarian options, and at $7.95 a dinner its a decent wallet-friendly choice.   oh and at the end of the meal when we were comment on the decor we were presented with two chinese fortune cookies which kind of broke the mood...especially since my fortune wanted to teach me how to say "long time" in chinese. yeeeah.</b_review>
<b_review>ordered lunch special at $7.95. foods not that good, i had no.7 with beans and meat. it seem to be missing something in flavoring. maybe msg or something. the meat tasted precooked but the beans was ok. the spring roll needs more fillings and more flavors. the service was ok but waitress didn't come by to ask for refill. the best part was the rice and the clear soup with strips of wonton.</b_review>
<b_review>we used to go here a lot and service was always slow, but the other night service was horrible as we waited 5 minutes to be seated and another 10 minutes before leaving as we had not even received water or any interaction with our server... very disappointed as their food was always good, but going to try something else next time.</b_review>
<b_review>this is a solid, clean, family-owned thai restaurant in central phoenix(arcadia).   i can't rate it higher because malee's is too far a superior choice for me, and using malee's as the 5-star standard for phoenix thai food, this instinctively comes in at a 3, which is my standard for "good", aka, i'm not complaining but i'm not blown away either. one of my staples at all thai restaurants is the tom kha gai soup, and the one here is, again, good.   the atmosphere is typical of any local neighborhood favorite. the decor is nothing special. it was fairly crowded on a weeknight, signaling its popularity with local residents who know where to go when they get a thai craving. the service is typical family-owned friendly.</b_review>

<text>delicious!  joe's is the best bbq that i tried in az.  i loved all their selections because they have something for everyone, from ribs to giant baked potatoes.  there is really not much i can say that the other reviewers have't said though so i'll just leave it with a 2 thumbs up!   oh, and i love the old tractor that's inside. haha  it's a classic... a 1948 a series tractor.  tad, the owner told me so! :)  see ya there!</text>
<u_review>this sprint store is a lot like other sprint stores but it has better music! mike s and chuck helped me transfer contacts from my old palm to my new evo and i was out in less than 20 minutes.  with such a simple request, i didn't even have to sign-in and wait. :)  they also have a self-serve kiosk so you can quickly pay your phone bill.  see ya there!</u_review>
<u_review>after moving to ca and reflecting back on this pediatrics office, i have a new appreciation for dr richardson and the way this office runs.  you don't have to wait a month for an appt and the doctor is thorough in explaining your growth charts and questions to you.  my new pediatrician is nice enough but, i didn't even get growth charts from him! lol  thank-you, dr richardson... i'm still smiling!</u_review>
<u_review>free diagnostic print-out if your service engine light comes on!  they have good prices on parts, too.  other than that, it's your basic auto store.    might see ya there!</u_review>
<u_review>love it!  this is such a weird lil theater.  my girl friend and i stopped in to catch a chick flick after eating at yupha's thai restaurant... i was pleasantly surprised at the low cost and crazy decor.  they've got it all set-up for halloween right now so it's pretty interesting!    anyway, to make a long review short... $3 a movie?  can't beat that.    see ya there!</u_review>
<b_review>tried this place on my weekend trip to the area.  this place has the wow factor.  we pulled up saturday night not knowing what to expect after seeing a line out the door and wrapped around the corner from the front entrance.  got in line and saw the line reached some twenty yards to the service counter.  my nerves were settled as we got close enough to see cafeteria style serving vs. table serving was the call of the night.  altogether the wait from start to finish couldn't have been more than twenty minutes and well worth it!        i had the half slab of ribs (6) with mac and cheese, bbq pit beans, potato salad, and root beer float.  the ribs were cooked just right and the combination of self serve sauce was excellent.  don't be afraid of the spicy sauce as the label is scarier than the actual kick of the sauce.  beans were awesome and included meat in the beans to extract full flavor.  the mac and cheese as well as the potato salad did not disappoint as they were tasty.  my party of 8 who had tried this place for the first time were all pleased with not only the food but the prices.  this is the best bbq for the price i've ever had.         the people of gilbert and surrounding area are very fortunate to have an eating establishment like this.  i live in sacramento, california and i will be back for more when i come to arizona.  finally something to rant and rave about in this area for dining!</b_review>
<b_review>yup, yup, and yupper!!! you can not go wrong here!  i smothered a giant baked potato with pulled pork, baked beans and joe's bbq sauce oh and a side of cole slaw and wow! hooowaaaaaah! nuff said!</b_review>
<b_review>visited last night for the first time.  wife and son liked it, i thought it was ok.  i deducted a star for lack or alcohol service.  i was really in the mood for a cold beer and ribs and joe's doesn't serve any alcohol of any kind.  food was excellent quality, but the sauce was rather bland.  there is a sauce bar where you can get some extra sauce with a little kick to it.  it's a family place in the southeast valley which probably explains the "no alcohol policy" and bland preparation.  but, it's a nice place with good food if you don't mind iced tea with your ribs.</b_review>
<b_review>first of all, my 5* rating is because of the food, not the atmosphere.  the food is delicious!  i love joe's bbq sauce, it is perfect, sooo much better than many other places.  all of the side items are yummy and fit in to the comfort-food category.  i still have not tried any of the desserts, but they all look delicious....cakes, brownies, and huge old-fashioned root beer floats. the employees are all very nice.  as far as the actual restaurant itself, it is very help-yourself, no-frills set-up.  if the place is busy, which it usually is because the food is so good :) , you have to stand in a long line.  eventually, you reach the cafeteria style area, where you grab a tray, utensils, napkins, etc.  i would not want to be eating at any of the tables or booths by the line with people standing there, watching me chow down.  once your order is taken at the next counter, you wait for your food, pay for it, and then find a place to sit.  there is a big outdoor seating area which is nice if you have kids. i just wish they served a nice cold beer here, but they do not.  guess that would ruin the family type atmosphere.  fortunately, postino's and oregano's is right across the street if you decide you do want to have a before or after dinner drink. you can also order-to-go outside the building, this is definitely a plus.</b_review>

<text>i love you.  i love you not.  i love you.  dear nee house,   i live no more than a 1/2 mile from you, and am a regular. i have waited to write this review, because of our love/hate relationship.    i love your food.  my family loves your food.    your yang zhou fried rice is heavenly.  it's loaded with shrimp, char siu pork, and vegetables.  i don't even mind that your spell it young chow on your menu.     the first time you made me pan fried prawns with honey walnuts i almost wept with joy.  the generous serving of prawns were fresh and perfectly crisp, and the walnuts and sauce flawlessly complimented the shrimp.  there are more staples to our usual order:  your cashew chicken is a favorite.  we love all of the vegetables, the paper-thin slices of chicken, complemented by the cashews.   your sliced beef with ginger and green onion is delectably unique.  i particularly love the pieces of ginger peppered throughout this flavorful beef dish.    your braised string beans!  your eggplant with garlic sauce!  so good, every single time.  and i have thoroughly enjoyed the wide variety of soups you expertly prepare.  i am particularly partial to vegetables egg roll.    your place is simple, and clean.  a decorator wouldn't hurt, but that's not why i don't want to visit.    it's your family.  alas, many in your family don't like me.  i suspect that they don't like people, in general.    yes, i know the wait-staff is your family (are they your daughters?), because if they were not, you would have fired them ages ago.    i heard about them, before my first visit.  i decided that they weren't going to scare me off; i've been to enough authentic chinese restaurants to be tolerant of unpolished, non western-style wait service.  but your folks aren't a little rough around the edges; this isn't a cultural disconnect.    they are rude.  abrupt. surly.  in a "they can't fire me, i'm family" sort of way.  in a "i hate my job" sort of way.  i've had many treasured moments with them.  i've tried.  i'll spare you the details, they are your family, after all- but they aren't good for business.  someone should really explain to them the concept of "tips".    you do have a couple good waitstaff-  a more mature woman and gentleman are a welcome reprieve.  so, what rating should i give you?  5 definitely for the food, 1.5 for the service.  4 for now.  i'll continue with to-go orders.</text>
<u_review>what brad t. said.   done.   what? i have to write more?  ok, here's a little more:  -real people, not just a pretty crowd -music can get really loud, but that's not necessarily a bad thing -great prices on pitchers of beer -kick back relaxed environment -fun for people watching</u_review>
<u_review>dan is 'da bomb!  if you want an honest assessment of the extent of your phone repair, and competent, reliable, and fairly priced service, sun cellular is the place to go.  if you want a pretty picture, a low ball price, then an unpleasant surprise once the other guy has torn your phone down, go somewhere else.  brought a phone in with an oddball part needing replacement, that needed to be ordered.  dan was very specific; he let me know the part was unusual and needed to be ordered from manufacturer, how long it would take to get it, and the cost.  i wasn't thrilled with the wait or the cost of the part.  i called a few other places, who told me "yeah, we can have that done today (or tomorrow)...", widely varied pricing, all on the low side.   i asked them to verify that they had the correct part in, and none of them had it, and the cost and the wait time went up with all of them.  i can just see it now... you bring the other guys your phone, they tear it down, then tell you "oops, gonna hafta wait, cost is higher".  now you're a captive audience, and they have your phone.  bad news!    needless to say, dan got the phone, and fixed it.  he was right on the price, right on the wait time, he knows his business.  labor fees are low.  he's got my business for life.  thanks, dan!</u_review>
<u_review>one of the few places in town you can get a fresh vegetable juice.  they offer a few variations, and you can also get wheatgrass shots here.  the employees are friendly.  some are fast, others are a little slower, but they'll get better with experience.  i enjoy this location, and will continue to return!</u_review>
<u_review>awesome!  there are so many reviews here already for this location!  here's my take on the visit, which occurred saturday jan 29.  after i convinced my 10year old that she might actually enjoy the unfamiliar (and get a fresh fruity drink), we stopped in at los reyes de la torta for lunch.  we were seated quickly and a friendly young lady waited on us.  we needed a minute to look over the large selection of items, so she brought us water and gave us a couple minutes.  my daughter wouldn't order a torta, but said she'd try mine.  she selected a quesedilla with guac, and a mango/strawberry aguas cremosas, which is kinda like a lighter milk shake- not as heavy on the cream. the white cheese was melted and folded between a deliciously buttered and grilled flour tortilla.  yum!  she enjoyed it, and the drink.  based upon rand's review, i ordered the "torta norteña" with salad.  iced tea is fresh brewed and good.  the food arrived quickly and was plated beautifully.  this was truly the best torta i have ever had.  the mix of ingredients was just right, and the bread was divine.  it was a little spicy for my daughter, but she loved the mix of flavors and suggested that the entire family come back for lunch next saturday.    servings are larges, so we took home 1/2 a torta and a bunch of quesedilla, which were quickly consumed by a perpetually hungry teen, who now wants to go get her own torta.  we enjoyed the atmosphere- lots of families, bustling and lots of energy.  positive, happy crowd.  the restaurant is in an old-school strip center, but is clean and effort has been made to make the inside cheerful.  we watched some of the prep cooks working and i noted that they used proper safety/sanitation measures at all times.    i can't wait to go back and try some other variations.  my daughter is now a torta convert.</u_review>
<b_review>moving here from san francisco where chinese food was as common as seeing women in scottsdale wear shorts with uggs, i found this place to be as good as it gets for chinese food in the valley.  as i read most of the comments for this restaurant or any other restaurant in general, people love to rant about how this was bad, or the service was horrible.....there was one that mentioned the food had a specific temperature when it came out. unbelievable how people can tell how hot or cold the food is to a specific degree! i love that some mouths come with a thermometer!!!  what if i stuck my....nevermind!!  as of now, nee house keeps me content when i am craving chinese food and missing san francisco.    everyone is trying the "american version" of chinese food.    being a foodie......a few things to learn about chinese restaurants.  1.  there really isn't anything as orange chicken, or pineapple chicken, etc...you ain't gonna find none of this shit in asia! try panda express if you want good orange chicken! 2.  chinese restaurants will not have the service you will find at a 3 michelin rated restaurant unless you're dining at tommy toy's in san francisco.  the attitude and rudeness comes with the territory.  anyone ever go for soul food?  same attitude, what's the difference?? tough it up, bitches!  besides, the food tastes better with attitude. 3. reality check.....we live in phoenix!!!!  you want chinese food, this is it!  nee house......try:  *beef chow fun.....as good as it gets in hong kong, ny, sf, or any major city with a chinatown. *a-vegetable......spicy, this dish's origin is from taiwan. very seasonal. i was surprised they have this dish year round here.  you can't even find that in the bay area year round.   * fried pork spareribs in salt-spicy.....a bit greasy, but pretty authentic.</b_review>
<b_review>wowsers.  like, jeepers, but wowsers.  have you ever watched the movie ratatouille?  there is a scene where, ego, the food critic takes a bite of remy's ratatouille and it wafts him back to his mother's kitchen.  well, one bite of the food here and i had wafted back  to flushing, new york.  we had the whole steamed sea bass from the tank.  we asked for a large fish.  it comes at market price.  they price is based on the weight of the fish. they cook it up with a soy sauce, ginger, scallion juice that is out of this world.  mmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm.   we also asked for authentic chinese greens and whatever they brought us was outstanding (it was not bok choy, yu choy, chinese broccolli or anything similar to those three).  i would have asked what they were if i had not done carry out.  our last dish was like a beef - bo luc loc dish.  very very tender.  on the drier side.  i'm not a huge fan of sauceless meats, but it was very well done.  bravo.   i fully agree with a previous review that this may be the most authentic chinese food in the valley.   note: the food here is very authentic.  if you are looking for panda express type food (general tso, lo mein, fried rice, etc), this may not be the place for you.</b_review>
<b_review>food was ok, waitress was a bitch and had us move after we say down to accommodate "regulars". found employees to be in a rush, food not up to par and just unaccomodating. never going back, stunk!!</b_review>
<b_review>very good chinese food. everything is very well done, and their fish dishes stand out. i would highly recommend the rock cod with black bean sauce, ma po tofu, and the rock cod with vegetables.</b_review>

<text>thought from the looks of it, it'd be a fun place. not really. atmosphere is nice by sight, but nothing else much to it. servers don't seem to care much. it's more of a gay-friendly hang out. so, if you're wanting to take a heteor-date there, i'd opt for a dif place. the food was mediocre. won't try it again. left a bad taste in my mouth.</text>
<u_review>ok, ok, ok, can i just say.....i'm so freakin' happy that i have finally found a local tasty, worthy, and most high star deserving mex-food place. i've had their famed tacos: the asada, pork and lengua=so good. no wonder the food network star enjoyed it. you can't go wrong. now....i've got to try the rest. go and check out one of their locations this weekend, you won't be sorry.</u_review>
<u_review>love this cute boutique of stylish & sassy clothes, jewelry, wall decor and more. this is a sure place to do some great shopping for yourself or for gifts. all women's attire and such. staff is great and informative. go with time so you can really take in all that's there. tell your friends, cuz you would never know it's there; kinda hidden. (there is another location in the shopping center off 101 and 67th with restaurant north and pei wei).</u_review>
<u_review>this place has a great atmosphere. it kinda reminds be of being in a cavern bar in spain. the food is great, especially the olive bowl. they also have some great entertainment, especially sundays. but it's true that the servers don't seem too educated on what is available when it comes to describing and suggesting the wine selections. all in all, it's a fun place to visit. *expect to wait for a table and you have to usually reserve the couches. it also does get a bit crowded at times and is kinda dark. so watch where you're going.</u_review>
<u_review>for some, this museum may be a life saver from the summer arizona heat. but those of us with infants, crawlers and no-yet toddlers....it's a huge disappointment. arizona already doesn't offer too much to this age range, but you'd expect more from a "children's" museum. there is one room where they can crawl, play and be free. still it's not the most exciting room. it's dull colorings and lack of activities is pretty sad. plus! if you can believe it, this museum has the gull to charge full price $9 for a one year old too! come on. if you have older kids, it does have more options. but if you have a one year old or younger....don't bother.</u_review>
<b_review>went with my wife during first friday's, have not tried the food but the place was nice and had good martini's. nice and strong. not a place to mingle with girls though if your into that, need to be into something else for this place. cool place, will be back for the food and give a review when i do.</b_review>
<b_review>great place to hang out for a bit if you catch their awesome $3 happy hour deals: all beer, house wine, well drinks. also remember there's a drink of the day all day. the environment is a little hipster but more casual and without the snooty judgment looks.  didn't try main food dishes. i thought wings had good flavor but they were not served hot. hummus tasted like the tub i have in my fridge - nothing to write home about.  overall, come here to throw a few back and start your night.</b_review>
<b_review>poor bar service! the bartender had no idea about any drinks! i asked her to make me something good, to surprise me & she did by saying, " she doesn't drink! so she has no idea!!" this is not what i expect from a bartender who expects tips again! well this one goes against this bar, not going again & they close early anyways</b_review>
<b_review>i have eaten at ticoz, fez, and switch and find them reasonably good. they aren't top of my list of downtown restaurants, and i can't say i've ever craved anything from them, but they usually offer reliable good eats. since i live in the neighborhood of bliss/rebar, and my friend and i were hungry for lunch this past sunday (and for those of you downtowners, you know how hard it is to find a good restaurant open on a sunday!!!), we thought we'd try it out.   since we had already eaten breakfast, we were looking forward to some lunch grub. unfortunately, bliss only serves breakfast until 2pm (as in, you are out of luck if you want to order lunch!). no worries. i like breakfast, so i'll eat it twice in one day. i ordered the breakfast burrito and my friend ordered the omelet. both of our meals were fine, just not spectacular. the biggest downside was my friend's omelet came with toast - no jam or anything, just plain toast. we asked our server if we could get some jam and were informed that the kitchen didn't stock jam! um, okay?! to the wait staff's credit, they went above and beyond to try and come up with something to put on the toast. i heard that they are going to start stocking jam in the future, so it must be a common request ;)  overall, i think the place has good potential. the service was great and the space is interesting (although doesn't appear to be any changes since the space was nine05). i found the menu to be pretty limited, and wished i had gotten to eat lunch vs. breakfast. i think i'll give them some time to work out the kinks before i venture back.</b_review>

<text>i'm upgrading it by one star because while they have a very limited selection what is available is of stellar quality and flavor. i can't give them a full five though because they use the worst spoons ever. seriously, they're so weak and flexible that you can't scoop your ice cream with them. what good is that? get some proper spoons and you may revel in your five star glory. until then, feel shame for your cheapness.</text>
<u_review>this one is tough.  i love their wine and cheese but the food is terrible.  i highly recommend going but only for the aforementioned wine and cheese.</u_review>
<u_review>i play in two leagues and i give one a five star review and the other a three star review.  kickball is a super fun way to meet cool people and get out of the house. it's also a great excuse for getting drunk in public on a weeknight. waka does a great job of organizing and works out amazing deals with the sponsor bars. the fees for the season are reasonable and the amount of fun that you will have is limitless.</u_review>
<u_review>cool enough venue, not much character but great acoustics and that's what you want when you shell out more than $100 for a concert.  how about dropping your fees a bit, eh?</u_review>
<u_review>the beer on tap is amazing.  but  i always feel like i'm walking into a private room and it's difficult to get a seat.</u_review>
<b_review>i loved the pink spot.  i have been there a few times already.  the first time i had to try the kona coffee ice cream.  it was delicious and so i got it in a shake and walked around roosevelt during first friday cooling off with my delicious shake.  i, being the coffee addict that i am, went back for another shake a few days later.  oh my, it is delightful.  a couple of weeks later my husband and i were lunching at z pizza and walked through the doorway connecting the two and got the kona mint sundae.  it is a scoop of kona (my favorite) and mint chocolate chip (his favorite) with hot fudge & whipped cream.  it was perfect for sharing and was a tasty end to our meal.    also, they have a really neat lamp hanging up at the end of the counter by the register that looks like white mesh tubes tangled together.  i was really interested in it so i asked the girl behind the counter where it came from.  the owner was sitting at one of the tables so we talked about it.  he even told me where he bought it in (a store up near kierland commons) and we had a nice little conversation about the design.    pink spot has a couple of new fans....</b_review>
<b_review>the ice cream was overly sweet, gummy, and lacked anything but a passing resemblance to its alleged flavor. there was, however, a lot of it. no joke. order the kid size unless you want an ice cream blob the size of the hindenburg.</b_review>
<b_review>i give pink spot three stars for a mixed experience.   the boy had a vanilla milkshake that was out of this world delicious, but my coffee ice cream tasted weird and left me cold. (no pun intended) it's pretty sad when the best part of the ice cream cone is the out-of-a-box mass produced cone.   i am not a big ice cream person anyway so i suppose one could assume that my experience was directly related to that, but i don't think it was. the staff had no idea what they were doing (note: train staff prior to putting them on shifts all by themselves) and i thought the prices were a little on the steep side for the quality of the product.   they do, however, get a few bonus points:  +1 for a fairly cute decor +1 for having chocolate covered frozen bananas. i hate the things, but it isn't something you'll find at most ice cream joints.</b_review>
<b_review>the pink spot is definitely my new spot for ice cream. i got an amazing brownie sundae there and it took me two days to eat it!    they also offer frozen bananas, which makes me feel  like i'm at a bluth banana stand (a la arrested development).   and! they deliver!</b_review>

<text>i would give this "urban grocery" a better rating if their hours were better!  being closed on sunday and monday, two of the most common "oops, i forgot something and need to go to the grocery store" days, is not the best idea.  it's great that this place is within walking distance of our home, but their stock just isn't that great.  i'm glad that i can get hickman's eggs there, but i wish that they used superstition farm milk instead of the ubiquitous shamrock.  superfarm's milk tastes better and lasts longer.  they have an interesting selection of produce, and i realize it's still growing, but we live in az so stuff like berries are not to be expected.  bummer.  they carry some stuff that i will purchase every so now and then like the az cheesecake co. treats and the bread from scottsdale, but that's about it.</text>
<u_review>i've been to fox a few times.  a couple times at this location and once at another location.  the other location (in north phoenix maybe?) blows this one away in terms of service, and well, pretty much everything else.  the food here is okay.  i tend to stick with the bacon cheeseburger here because it is usually pretty decent and it comes with their yummy fries.  they've never really messed up my food here, so that's a good thing.  i haven't had anything that was much of a standout here, but it is solid food.  the service on the other hand, is terrible.  the times i have been here, i have been completely ignored after being seated.  i have had to track down a server to get someone to at least take drink orders.  they are usually pretty unattentive too.  it could be worse i guess.  just never go when there is a crowd, as the servers have no idea how to handle that volume of patrons.  this strikes me as so weird considering they are nearby two major sports venues as well as a movie theatre.    if you are hanging out at westgate and get hungry at a non-peak eating hour, you should try fox.  they have a fairly interesting menu and the food is usually pretty good.  just don't expect stellar service.</u_review>
<u_review>i could retell the entire awful experience that happened here, but i'd rather not relive it and you can just read glenn's review instead.  in case you don't long story short is incompetent server wearing little clothing can't do anything right, spills ketchup on friend's white shirt.  i checked out the menu for this place online, and i was super excited, there were a lot of things that sounded great.  unfortunately, this is one of those really irritating places that has a lunch menu and a dinner menu.  i ended up ordering the meatloaf sandwich.  the meatloaf sandwich was less than satisfying.  it was served open faced, which was cool, but that left the congealed gravy to cool almost instantly.  the bread underneath was really tough and hard to eat with the meatloaf.  the meatloaf itself was overcooked, practically blackened, and it had peppers in it.  i thought it was weird and rather unappealing.  i don't think mushroom gravy and peppers belong together.  service was just downright awful, but i think it was only the girl we got stuck with.  she was rather rude and pretentious.  a particular moment in time that stuck out to me was when we commented how heavy the menus were she shot back at us "well you're not the one carrying them all day."  sure sweetheart...  i'm pretty sure she is a trust fund baby who is now forced to work her first job ever because of the economy.  she picked the wrong one.  i think there is another location and maybe, just maybe we could go back to try that one.  surely the servers are a little more well seasoned that the incompetent broad we had.</u_review>
<u_review>yay for good blockbusters.  there is one way closer to the house, but their selection sucks, the people are rude, and it's just plain ghetto.  this location is very large and has a great selection.  i think their selection is better than most.  the employees we have interacted with have always been very friendly and have a good sense of humor.  we actually have the blockbuster online thing (think netflix) and it works fantastically.  whenever we come here to use one of our in-store exchanges, we are always in and out of there very quickly.  the other location seemed to have difficulties with that.  anyway, this is my favorite blockbuster in the valley.  the two reasons i subtracted one star is the awful parking lot, and i wish it were a bit closer to my house.</u_review>
<u_review>bleh.  i do not like this location at all!  i normally don't have anything bad to say about amc theatres, but this one just makes me mad.  first of all, the bathrooms are terrible!  they are way too small and somehow manage to look like they're 30 years old!  i also hate the location of this one with all the awful chains around (not awful because they're chains, but awful because their food/product is awful).  the actual theatres are not the nicest and could use a bit more thorough cleaning after each show.  the seats are strangely small.  i feel like they ordered the wrong chairs for this one because they don't feel like any of the other amc's that i've been to.  last but not least, this theatre is entirely over-run by children.  they are everywhere and their parents don't seem to care how their screaming and whining bothers other people.  ugh.  i won't come back unless i have to.</u_review>
<b_review>i love what this place is striving towards. things i specifically love:   1) a stable, dependable, local outdoor farmer's market on saturday and wednesday - full of awesome local goods and repping the people who actually grow/make the stuff  2) a permanent building housing a stock of a selection of said goods, open most days of the week  3) although i'm already a locavore, discovering new sources for real food, like doublecheck ranch's beef etc - i'm a huge fan!  4) the cool design and layout of the structure  5) a genuinely friendly atmosphere and helpful, if still learning, staff  6) the constantly fresh-roasted beans at the royal coffee bar - hayes is the (somewhat effeminate) man!  7) a place to keep discovering new quirky local arts and foodstuffs   i hope to give this 5 stars in the future. here's what needs to happen:   1) be open on sunday  2) expand your offerings and keep the shelves filled (i know this is a challenge)  3) have more ppl available to help ring up during busy times (market saturday, etc)  4) inspire more confidence that if i order a sammich, i'll get it before dinner (i haven't ordered one yet, but i'm scared to because i don't know who's gonna make it - i don't see anyone cooking stuff!)  ultimately, this is exactly the kind of stuff phoenix needs in its efforts to  be the "real city" that everyone bitches it ain't. so if you want it to succeed and want more of this in phoenix's future, support it. give constructive feedback. buy real local food instead of the crap at most supermarkets.   you have 3 choices: support, bitch or get stoned and order domino's</b_review>
<b_review>12/15/10  came here to meet w/ a yelper friend to check out the phoenix public market fare at night- all of my previous visits had been in the mornings.  most of the vendors and food trucks were the same as those i've seen before, but there were a few new (to me!) and notable, too.  one in particular offered ultra-thin sweet dutch stroopwafels (cookies) i was tempted to take home, but the $9 sticker for about 7 or 8 pieces kept me at bay.  that, and the calories that they promised to bring w/ them, as well!  hehe.  but i am getting ahead of myself...  friend hadn't arrived, yet, but i went inside the market to order the bbq pork sandwich, which i'd been eyeing for a couple of visits, and a black cuppa at the coffee at the royale.  all the tables had been taken, save for one, which i soon found out had wobbly legs, so i asked the man w/ a laptop nearby if he could share his table w/ me.  he generously obliged, and i sat down thinking i'd be able to write a few reviews while waiting for my friend and sandwich to arrive.  as it turned out, i didn't write any reviews that evening, for soon we were talking about our food adventures in the valley-- funny how effective an icebreaker the love of discussing good food is, eh?  after a few minutes, i went to check on my sandwich and arrived at the table w/ it, plus a chocolate-dipped almond cookie.  since the cookie was an impulse-buy, i decided i'd share my sandwich w/ my new acquaintance, so that i may save some room for the tasty cookie!  loved the pretzel bun and all of the veggies that came w/ the sandwich (red bell pepper, caramelized onions, and even green beans!), the shredded pork was ok-- i would've enjoyed it more had it been less shredded, and more chunky in texture.  the cookie, a little chewy on the inside and a bit crumbly on the outside, was absolutely delightful, especially when paired w/ my cup of black coffee.  friend finally arrived, so we said our long goodbye to our new acquaintance, and headed outside to see what's new... truckin' good food was out there selling homemade cocoa for $2- it tasted fantastic, and perfect for a cool evening in december...  now that i've thought about it, i should've bought some of those stroopwafels!</b_review>
<b_review>nice little place to visit. while in the neighborhood i stopped by. it looks so urbanly adorably, which is actually high on my book. while i wouldn't drive from my house to this store . i would stop by to pick up local items like:  great prices on queen creek olive products beautiful local / maya's produce, i purchase lettuce, huge chard and shallots okay prices on items i use like organic split peas, sun dried tomatoes,  and grains  picked up a tshirt for the urban markets ... and looking forward to checking it out again.</b_review>
<b_review>great neighborhood market with all local and organic products. have eaten here for lunch and my salad was amazing.  also i have had coffee at the royal and though its good, i thought it was a little overpriced. i really wished i could make this a more regular place to shop, but it can be a little on the more expensive side, and selection of products can be a little limited. last night we went looking for crave ice cream and there was only one flavor left in the freezer. overall, the produce is awesome and most of the products local and something to support. go local!</b_review>

<text>da chicken. merciful heavens. i can't think of one thing i would have changed about the chicken i got from here.  the crust was crunchy,  crumbly, and tasted like golden nuggets (perfectly seasoned...and i mean perfectly)...and this is after a 30 minute drive home.  the meat was tender and juicy - even the breast.  and most of all, the flavor went through the whole piece of chicken, not just skin deep. everyone has their definition of what good fried chicken is.  this place has defined mine.  haven't had better chicken at any restaurant or even at anybody's table other than my grandmother's.  they got everything about it right. i forgot that i had two sides - cabbage and rice with gravy. the cabbage was decent, but i actually prefer cracker barrel's as it has more flavor.  the texture of mrs white's was better and it was chopped up in more presentable pieces.  but was lacking any wow.  still good, don't get me wrong.  my grandmother's cabbage has spoiled me; it's hard to satisfy me with this dish. the rice and gravy was a bit disappointing.  it was bland gravy over white rice.  i was hoping the gravy would be thick and creamy but it was instead quite thin.  not seasoned very much...  i wonder if this is the same gravy they use to smother stuff in?  i hope not. for dessert i got the banana pudding.  i have a cousin who i think makes the best bp in existence.  but, there's always someone better.  mrs. white's almost almost beat out my cousin's, but not quite.  i don't know how i can say that, seeing as how the whole little bowl was gone in 3 minutes:)  i guess that is a testament to my cuz's bp, because this stuff was awesome.  only complaint was that some of the bananas were too ripe, although some people like it that way? that's all for my meal.   i didn't even look at the receipt, hmmm...no clue how much it all cost me haha.  i didn't care.  i've been hearing about this place since i moved to az and actually swerved from the far right lane on jefferson into the parking lot, taking out several vehicles in doing so (j/k).   the place itself as others have said is pretty dumpy.  the best food is found in places of this status but as i was looking around i felt myself wishing that this specific place would get a face lift.  i don't know, its just that they are such a staple and well-known place...they could at least frame some of the memorabilia they have on the wall.  not dirty though, mind you.  the girl there was diligently mopping.  too much clutter by the register...personal items of the staff just laying around.  c'mon now.  represent what you serve, instead of allowing people to think that what they will get served may represent the look of the place.  a rinky dink liquor store that serves the best corned beef - they can look like a disaster, that's just fine.  but these guys are a soul food force in the area and i feel they could be even more with an update to their building. the folks that were working there were just fine to me.  an older man greeted the customers, gave instruction to the servers, and took my order.  he knew the regulars and greeted them enthusiastically.  i liked that.  furthermore, some guy came in needing change.  the man (hmmm i guess that's probably mr white???) gave him tips on where to park for cheap, gave him the money to park somewhere, and told him to hurry so he won't be late for his appointment.  :) :) :)  also shared a few observations about a woman on tv (let's make a deal).   no one was rude.  you read what the golden rule is and you'll see its enforced here.  do unto others... i saw a plate come out to a dine-in customer that was piled, and i mean piled with fried chicken smothered in gravy and with greens and something else on the side.  it looked ridiculously amazing.  i will go back.  i will try the porkchops, smothered this and that, and of course the catfish.  i'll also try some other sides, maybe the two i chose were their ho-hums anyway. i recommend trying their chicken at least once! oh and i saw someone on here mention their to-go order was skimpy...sorry bud but mines was 3 huge pieces that didn't even allow the box to close:)</text>
<u_review>never thought i'd write a review about a starbucks, but this one is worthy of a review. i work doing a job i don't like.  i get to work early...like before-god-wakes-up early. i'm usually not in a good mood during my first few minutes there. but every morning, a couple co-workers and i make a trip to this starbucks.  its like 5 minutes away walking (it used to be on adams and we went there, too).  its always nice coming here.  there are 3 staff members that i know by name now (jason, johnny, and brittney (sp)).  these guys are great.  friendly, talkative, easy going, and down to earth.  i've gone to some starbucks and felt like i was really doing something wrong by coming in and ordering a beverage.  this location is so not that way.  even when they get busy - they stay at the same coolness level.  another thing that i really love here is the way they just hook a brother up - suggesting awesome drinks that i would never have thought to put together.  i've had some crazy delicious frappes thanks to these guys.  and before them, i never knew what a black eye was!  a lot of times i'll just say "make me something good", and they hook it up.  besides the early morning crew, i've also had good experiences in the afternoon when its pretty darn busy.  don't know any of their names though.  this place is such a requirement for my work day.  i need it.  honestly.  its not just the caffeine (i actually get decaf anyway)...its not just the familiarity of having a warm beverage in the morning.  its coming here and seeing familiar faces and chewing the fat about the nba, and having that personal touch, and stuff (and the cute cashier with a great smile that i don't know her name...).    these folks are great here.  i don't know enough about what is good coffee and what is not to rate the coffee.  i mean, i drink the decaf with white chocolate and cinnamon dolce just about every morning...and i think it tastes good.  so yeah, i can't say their coffee or frappes are better or worse than anywhere else.</u_review>
<u_review>this is my first fine-dining experience.  unfortunately, i was not impressed. i guess i expected a waiter like spongebob when he cleared his mind of everything but fine dining and breathing.  but what i got was just a regularly decent wait staff.  nothing wrong with that, but i thought there'd be an "experience" to go along with the price here.  nope.  we had a party of about 18 for a couple grads in the family.  i will say that we were all given good attention by our waiter, and he did a fine job earning his tip.  its just that there wasn't anything special about the service that you wouldn't find at applebee's or something.  the food was an experience, though. i had plenty of time to look the menu over a thousand times (late people, i swear).  the cheapest thing on the menu was in fact on the kids' menu.  but we were there for a special occasion, and it was a steak house that featured....steak.  so i would've kicked myself for ordering anything other than steak.  i may have paid $50 for it, but good lord that rib-eye was the best steak i ever had.  no exaggeration.  like i said, i've never been to a restaurant like this, so maybe that's why i've never had a steak that good.  and i know there are probably competitors for the best steak in chandler and the surrounding cities.  but for me, this is as good as its ever gotten.  if there is a steak that tastes better than this, i don't know if i could handle it emotionally.  i'd probably start crying.  i don't have to describe it.  if you eat steak, then you know what a good steak tastes like.  this one tasted like tha; probably better.  flawless.  of course, all sides are extra.  i ordered nothing but the meat, as i guess i'm a little too budget-minded for this place.  the pop i ordered took the place of potatos or a salad.    people ordered the lambchops, chicken, sliced filet mignon, crab cakes, and some other stuff.  the only complaint was about the french fries haha.  i didn't try them.  i will say that the wedge salads looked great and were very big.  also, as far as the amount of food you get, the chicken seemed to offer the biggest portion size.  honestly though, everybody paid so much for their food that i didn't want to ask anyone if i could try their stuff.  it really is a nice place, too...at least i think so.  the lights are dim so people won't see you frown at the prices.  the napkins are fancy...and so are the ones in the bathroom apparently, as my cuz brought one out to show me.  it is not quiet - but not louder than any other restaurant.  from what i read and hear people say, a fine dining place is supposed to be quiet and stuff.  if that matters to you, perhaps this isn't fine enough for you, because its just like any place else volume-wise.  perhaps 3 stars is stiffing them a bit.  i mean, my meal was perfect...the service was good...and the ambiance was nice.  am i just too much of a cheapo?  did i expect too much of an experience for the price?  maybe.  but i still feel that everything except the steak could have been just a tad better.  if there is ever another reason to go fine-dining, i'm sure i would suggest some place else instead of coming here again.  i saw what they have to offer...and despite the awesome steak, it just wasn't enough to bring me back.</u_review>
<u_review>had to add a star for two reasons:  lechon.  this is it.  there was a tray heaping full of the stuff in all its golden and shiny glory.  i pointed and said that i had to have it. the first piece i tasted was the equivalent of finding $200 in an old wallet when your rent is due.  crunchy skin that immediately melted in my mouth.  juicy sinful fatty stuff that clung to the thick pieces of skin.  and tender meat so juicy that it made me google how this stuff was made.  lechon is all its hyped up to be.  the other reason for the star is for the hospitality i receive whenever i go in there.  well, i've only been twice, but each time has been great.  once again, the family atmosphere was in full effect.  i still haven't asked who is who, but i'll work my way up to that.  but the people behind the counter have been awesome.  this time, a dude big in stature chatted about the knicks vs. bulls rivalry and actually made a point that i could not deny.  seems like a great guy and he had complete confidence in his lechon, which he full well should.  but what tops it all is the way he ended our transaction.  let's just say it was the top of the mountain for customer/vendor relationships.  when trust is built between an owner and a customer, you pretty much have a guaranteed repeat customer.  that's what the factory has gained in me.  also, i got the bbq ribs again...and they were even better than last time if that's even possible. and finally, i had an order of lumpia.  now...mines were burnt on the ends.  it wasn't ideal to have to chop the ends off of each one, but the taste of them nulls the fact that i had to do that.  these were awesome tasting lumpia.  maybe they just took their eyes off of them for a minute too long or something.  i'll definitely give these another go. i can see 5 stars in their future if the food maintains its deliciousness, which i am confident it will.</u_review>
<u_review>in my last update, i stated that the italian beef didn't quite do it for me.    i just had one today and it was completely awesome.  totally soaked, and they gave me extra juice to boot.  i've also had a pizza puff and a slider.  the pizza puff was dead on...its all the greasiness and crispiness and gooiness that i remember from the chi.  the slider was tasty, but don't confuse this with any white castle offerings.  both of these are cheap and worth tacking onto any order.  what can i say?  i love this place.</u_review>
<b_review>i spent many formative years in eastern north carolina & i can certainly appreciate some good home cooking - this place definitely satisfies that craving. i had the most amazing smother/friend pork chops (their seasoning is delish), mixed greens & black eyed peas - sweet tea and the only reason i can't give more stars is because they were out of the peach cobbler i have heard so many great things about - however, the apple pie i had instead was definitely yummy. i plan to make this a reg spot once i move uptown - :)</b_review>
<b_review>mrs. white's is the biggety bomb!   i don't know how else to say it. i can't believe there was only one review so far. this place deserves better!  if you like southern aka food, this is the spot. it is 100% authentic.  my favorites - anything on the menu.  the collard greens are perfect.  the okra gumbo is perfect.  the fried chicken, plain or smothered (in gravy) are perfect.  the pork chops are perfect. just don't tell my rabbi i said that. ;)  the catfish is perfect. don't tell my rabbi about that one, either, mmkay?  the cornbread is perfect.  the red beans and rice... perfect.  starting to see a pattern here?  a few tips:  get there early. they start to run out of stuff if you show up too late.  you can order a meal and then things by the piece. like, order the catfish and a chicken thigh or something.   they don't have soda. they do have tea. sweet tea (already sweetened - too sweet for me but very authentic southern) or unsweetened.  order extra cornbread. it comes with the meal but you'll thank me.  if you don't have room for dessert, get it to go. the peach or whatever cobbler they have is kick ass, as is the bread pudding.  you will get seated and then order. they don't bring a bill to your table, you go up to the counter when you're done, tell them what you ordered, and pay there. that's why it's called the 'mrs whites golden rule.' make sure to leave a good tip. they deserve it.  being a regular will get you better service, but you aren't going there for the service. you're going there to eat.   there's a good chance you'll spot some phoenix sports stars. i don't know who they are because i don't follow sports, but you can pretty much pick em out.  they are only open for lunch.   that's pretty much all you need to know. bring your friends or coworkers, enjoy, and plan to endure a 3 hour food-induced coma when you're done.</b_review>
<b_review>just like the south  we love your typical meat-and-three type restaurants across the south.  we never expected to find such a place in arizona.  at mrs white's, you would think that you were in nashville or birmingham.  the fried chicken was delicious and the mixed greens very nice.  i do wish that they had mashed potatoes.  unfortunately, they had run out of their famous peach cobbler, so we'll have to go back.</b_review>
<b_review>having heard so much about mrs. whites, had to try it.  known for its fried chicken, on my first trip i asked the counter waitress (very helpful by the way) what she suggested and she said "the pork chop." well i came for the fried chicken so she suggested a "combination plate" with both. glad she did!  the pork chop, thin and apparently pan fried was absolutely terrific! if i could have, i would have eaten the bone! obviously a combination of coating and temperature, which is able to partially caramelize the small amount of fat on the pork chop, make it delectable. the fried chicken was a bit of a disappointment on both occasions. not the best i have had and honestly, i could almost do as well at home. additionally, the breast piece (on both occasions) was anemic without much meat and skin. sides? mac and cheese and the cabbage are addictive. the best? cornbread! wonderful, hot, full of flavor and no butter is needed.  not a bargain at $13 without a drink for lunch (they are only open until 7 pm) but lots of choices besides the pork chop and fried chicken.</b_review>

<text>i stopped in today on a whim after a trader joe's visit. i was impressed by how clean and organized it was inside! maybe all the construction that had been going on had me associating it with dirt, but there was none to be found!   due to a lunch hour time crunch, i automatically opted for the daily special- a boracho burrito and large drink. for 8 bucks i was impressed by the quality:  the chips were standard issue corn and the salsa was in a little squirt bottle that the cashier got out of a fridge behind the counter. it was blended instead of chunky-which i find muy bueno.  there were good sized chunks of tender beef in the burrito, a ton of cheese on top, extra sauce all over and generous dollops of guac and sour cream on the side. definitely a solid, inexpensive meal. i will hit it up again for sure.   *for some reason it got me thinking about one of my fave college days hangouts- two peso's! except they dont have a guy yelling "two-feefty-four, nomber twofeeftyfour" when your order is up. loved that. **that was totally irrelevant, but it felt good.</text>
<u_review>i get all of the fox rc emails and yesterday received one about a limited time lunch special for $7.50 for 2 of either a side chopped salad, soup of the day or side pasta (lasagna not included) and a drink. a couple of co-workers and i decided to hit it up today and i was pleasantly surprised. not that i had assumed it was bad or anything- i'd just never been.   i had the turkey and feta salad because it had the most veggies-cucumbers, tomatoes, corn and avocado's and  tender turkey squares. it was really good! so was the pasta- marinara shells with a meatball. it was a perfect amount of food for a great price.</u_review>
<u_review>we were planning on going to jalepeno inferno last friday, but when we arrived it was a madhouse. a man walking out advised me not go there so i convinced my guy to try jade palace instead. they were quite busy as well but were able to seat us immediately. we started with hot and sour soup and the bowl for two is huge. it was really tasty, as were the crispy wontons that they bring out with every meal at no charge.  for dinner i had the vegetarian egg foo young and j had szechuan chicken. both dishes were delicious. they were also very generous and we had a great meal to take home with us. the service was top notch with our drinks being refreshed as soon as they got low without us having to ask. they are very attentive even when they are slammed and to me, that is the mark of a great restaurant. the prices were pretty good, the food was amazing and the service superior. writing this is making me want to go there for lunch today!</u_review>
<u_review>we had cob for a work lunch the other day and it left much to be desired. i did like the guacamole and the hotter salsa, but not much else. well, the rice wasnt bad either. maybe it was the whole to go thing, but it wasnt very good. and the sour cream had black things in it? olives? i dont know, but i didnt find out.</u_review>
<u_review>i really like eating here. it's clean, cheap, tasty and they have sriracha on hand, whats not to like?? i especially love the pasta with spicy marinara and grilled chicken. i add so many veggies and then have them top it off with green pesto. then i douse it with more hot sauce from their condiment area and, voila! perfect lunch under 10$.</u_review>
<b_review>i've eaten at the gilbert location before so i remembered that the tacos were good.  was scoping this place out at least a month before it opened....it was like a mervins commercial....open open open!  well, it finally did, and the tacos are still good! for a semi fast food joint the food is well above average!  crunchy tacos are delish..beef and chicken, rice has a good flavor, i don't really eat beans so their beans are ??? and the other items other ppl were eating looked good.  guac...not bad and better than expected. chips...decent. salsa decent.  like i said, great for what it is. two thumbs up for clean and super nice service!  we will be back soon for sure!</b_review>
<b_review>great prices. my daughter and i ate there for $12 and walked out stuffed. it's definitely not authentic mexican but it is still good. i got the green chili chimichanga and a beef taco. both were fantastic for the money. the only knock on the place i have is that it was 90* in the dining room so i just took my food to go.</b_review>
<b_review>this was a last minute choice when we were in the area. i had never been before and this location had just opened. the inside is very family friendly with new everything. the food just left something to be desired. i thought it was just ok for the price. i ordered a bean burrito and the tortilla tasted a little off--i couldnt put my finger on it. the chips and salsa were great though. the service was also good, lots of high school looking kids, but they were nice.</b_review>
<b_review>i am impressed!  cute, clean, tasty.  and i'm hard to please with mexican food.  it rivals some of the "better" mex restaurants for traditional fare.  i loved the green chili burro.  the guacamole was very nice. the chips were fresh and not greasy.    actually - better restaurants could learn a lot from the decor and ambiance in some burros.  tasteful, colorful flowers on every table - even on the outside tables.  that's part of a good experience.  table delivery is a plus for a "fast food" restaurant.  management and employees were happy and attentive.  we'll be back......soon.</b_review>

<text>is there a better meal than breakfast? i think not... any so, we have sort of made it a weekly tradition to have breakfast at the place. my better half had eaten there prior to it moving to its new location, and i had never been there. she was not a fan of the previous location.   after looking at yelp and the 4 stars reviews, i talked her into trying it again. and we are huge fans!   it starts with mimosas and from there, it's breakfast bliss. the portions are huge, and the servers are friendly. good food, but no real maple syrup. so, we bring our own.   it's a good experience.</text>
<u_review>how is it that we find ourselves in scottsdale so often? ugh. but, when you have an opportunity to partake in some lunch with a bestie....   we had heard that brio was really good, and it did not disappoint. the hostess at the front was nice, sweet, and had a great sense of humor. we were seated promptly, and ordered arnold palmers and water for 3 as we waited for our 3rd. the lemonade is fresh squeezed and made in house. honestly, the ap's were bomb!  i ordered the chef's special pasta, which had bacon (mmmmm baaacon!) and carmelized onions in it. it was good, but the lobster bisque i ordered before my entree showed up was exquisite.  gf ordered a breaded chicken salad, which i had a couple of bites of, and i thought it was great too.   service was top notch, and the price was fair. all together a great experience.   i love the interior decor, as well. it is well lit from above, but not too bright from the sides. the lights are super cool also.   looking forward to going back for happy hour.</u_review>
<u_review>i don't know how i've never stopped into this place, as i have spent years around the arcadia neighborhood. i guess it's a good thing, because greatness is often overlooked when one is not prepared to see, or find greatness. this place is great. i've spent the better part of 5 years looking for a gyro that takes me back to santorini, and the other beautiful places in greece. i ordered a gyro, and when eating greek, always get a little bit of falafel.   the gyro was exquisite. when i got to z's, i was still reading reviews from other yelpers on this place, and fully intended to continue reading. i couldn't put the gyro down. the sauce in the gyro was perfection. it was stuffed full of meat. the lettuce was crisp and fresh, and the onions looked like they had just been cut. and that sauce. it would find its place in my heart faster than any ranch dressing ever could.   the falafel was dynamic. tons of robust, distinguishable flavors overtook my mouth. not all at the same time, but on their own time throughout the bite. toasty nutlike flavor, with the smoothness of the chickpea, and then the bang of the coriander, finishing with the subtle notes of the other herbs, and more toasted fried flavors. unreal.   the service is incredible. my gyro was on the table at the same time as i sat down after filling my beverage cup. they are friendly, gracious, and love making great food. the restaurant is also impeccably clean.  i will be be back regularly, and frequently.</u_review>
<u_review>after paying $10 for a footlong tuna and a drink at subway (read the review), i was obligated to find new lunchtime stomping grounds. and i've found one.   how someone is going to take points for "ambiance" in a chicago style gyro eatery is worth my lolz. but, you're not going to a chicgo style gyro eatery for "ambiance". you're going for good grub, and a bottomless drink cup. this place rocks for what it is.   the decor is cool. i spent the vast majority of my meal staring at the posterboard sized photos of downtown chicaga. i was lost and mezmerized at the fine details of the photos. i would bite, and stare. bite, and stare.   and there was much to bite on. this pita came stuffed with succulent, tasty meat. i'm not a tomato fan, so i left those for those who are. my gyro was oozing sauce. i would take a bite, and while enjoying the deliciousness that permeated my over-stuffed mouth, contemplated what to do about the sauce on my fingers. knowing that if i dared to open my mouth, i'd be looking at the food i had just started to chew, but understanding that if i did nothing with the sauce it would drip off of my fingers into the basket. quite the dilemma, i tell you. bite, and stare.... ooooh! look! fries! mmmmmmm....   i was there at 11:30 on a thursday, and it was less than crowded. parking was no issue.   all of this for less than $7. yep. i'll take my $3, and give it to the bum on the street. better than spent at subway.</u_review>
<u_review>i am writing this from the perspective of being a photographer.   this is the first time that i have been to the preserve after reading, and hearing so much about it. i found it to be quite disappointing.   the issues with the preserve, again, only from a bird spotting, and photography standpoint are many.  1. the area is completely overgrown. it has limited the view of all of the ponds and removed the vast majority of quality shooting locations. beyond that, walking along the paths is ridiculous. i was walking along ponds, i should have been able to see, completely obstructed by shrubs and trees.  to define a quality shooting location; an area one can sit in, with a 180 degree view of the pond or the subject in front of the person.  there were trees that had 1/3 of its trunk covered in debris. i sat and watched birds, rats, and rabbits emerge from the debris.   this overgrowth is both unsightly, and a fire hazard.   2. the majority of the benches and blinds have been rendered unusable. again, it comes down to the area being overgrown.  i walked past several benches that were placed on the edge of the pond, yet a view of dense shrubbery was presented. the blinds in the special use areas are shrouded and covered. what's the point of having a permit to use an area that has no unobstructed view?   3. varmints. there are rabbits everywhere. yes, they're cute, but rabbits bring rats, and there were a ton of those too. this is a disease outbreak waiting for a place to happen.  i went today looking for burrowing owls. all gone. why? cats. feral cats have preyed on all of the burrowing owls, and they have been removed.   4. the ponds are inconsistently watered. this has made the birds leave for other locations.   i am incredibly displeased that i went today. i can go to a golf course and see the same birds with far less hassle, and can get great shots. it's unfortunate that the staff of this preserve isn't committed to making this a pristine bird area.</u_review>
<b_review>generous portions, an attentive staff, and very popular.  we came here because it had such good reviews. it was worth the trip, as the food was delicious. they have a really nice menu, with a little bit of everything. big ol' steak and eggs plate, if you're interested. i was, it was delicious.</b_review>
<b_review>this place rocks, great diner with great food.  it doesn't say mike & ronda's but rather just "the place" and it doesn't do it justice because it is much more than just "the place".  i had the chorizo plate and my brother had a sampler plate of every meat they have to offer.  the eggs were great, the hash browns were perfectly crisp and flavorful, the tortillas were fresh tasting and my brothers bacon was awesome.  i will definitely come back.  it doesn't look fancy inside but it is pretty large, i can imagine this place getting busy on the weekend but i usually avoid crowds when i can.</b_review>
<b_review>the food here is always amazing!  the amount of food you receive can fill up two people. the staff is friendly and the service is quick.  if you are going on the weekend, go before 9:00am it get's busy!</b_review>
<b_review>az omelette, hash, pancakes all delicious. food makes up for subpar interior but what do you expect from a "mom and pop" operation. they at least tried, but who cares the food was great.</b_review>

<text>our la perla experience started off with the fear of being shot during the vatos altercation in the fiesta room that carried out into the parking lot. our debate to stay or not weighed heavily on the bogo coupon we had.  i ordered the chicken chimi "regular" size, the chicken was good but i didn't care for the red sauce they topped it with. the beans were very runny and the rice didn't have much flavor. my boyfriend ordered the carne asada plate, the meat was a little bland but otherwise ok. he also didn't like the beans. the food wasn't horrible but wasn't good either. sorry la perla, we won't be a return customer!</text>
<u_review>love going to the drive-inns with the family. such a great deal, $6.50 for adults & kids under 5 are free. you can bring your own food & drinks in without having to smuggle them in. they do have a snack bar with a good selection of food & snacks that are decently priced. for $6.50 you can watch 3 movies. the 1st one starts around 7:30 (a little later in the summer) and there are 2 showings after that. the kids normally pass out towards the end of the 1st movie, then mommy & daddy can relax and watch another movie together.  tonight we watched kung fu panda 2 and our 2nd movie is about to start. great times, i love my man!</u_review>
<u_review>this was my first time eating at pho thanh as well as my 1st time eating vietnamese food. the restaurant is small and most of the tables were full so that's a good sign.  i was pleasantly surprised with our food & dining experience. i was not sure what to order so my boyfriend helped me pick something since he has eaten vietnamese before. i ordered the lemongrass chicken; it was a little spicy but not over powering. he ordered some pho, a pork sandwich and some spring rolls, all of which were good as well. we are both excited to go back and try some different items.</u_review>
<u_review>we love greek food & we're always open to trying a new place. good fellas definitely didn't let us down. the owner greeted us when we walked in & asked if it was our 1st time there. he asked what we like & suggested a couple items. my boyfriend ordered the 3 meat plate that comes with steak, chicken, ground beef & rice. i ordered the 2 meat plate that comes with chicken, ground beef & rice. both meals came with fresh pita bread & some sauce. the owner was very nice & gave us 2 bowls of chicken curry potato soup to try on the house. neither of us has had greek soup before & wow was it great! i had no idea what i was missing. all of the meats were delicious, perfectly cooked & seasoned. i was a little leery about the ground beef but it didn't disappoint, it was great as well.  overall we were very pleasantly surprised and will definitely be back again.   they also have a check in coupon so it saves you 20% off an entrée plate. i hope they get a lot of business so they stay open and we can dine often!</u_review>
<u_review>my boyfriend and i wanted to try someplace new. we have drove by scramble several times so on this particular morning after we took the kids to daycare we stopped in for breakfast. it's nice and clean inside, you walk in to read a big menu and place your order at the counter. they give you a number to put on your table and the waitress brings your food out.  both of our food was good, will be back to try different items.</u_review>
<b_review>when driving up off of glendale ave, you get to see very lively but campy murals and 3 massive parking lots before you enter the back door (the main entrance-don't try the door at the front or you'll never get in).  the food is just like you'd want from a traditional, homestyle, local, family owned joint-- excellent rice and beans (all homemade), great enchilada and tamale sauces, excellent tortillas, fresh chips and sweet tomato salsa.  the prices were excellent-- lunch specials for 5 bucks, dinner platters for 1-2 people 9.50.  give this place a try.  it's a real down home place.</b_review>
<b_review>stopped in for lunch today and thought they'd be packed from the looks of the parking lot.  once inside they didn't appear to be that busy.  we were seated right away.  chips and salsa came first and i was certainly in need of a beverage by the time they came to take the drink order.  service from this point was very slow.  took a good 45 minutes to get our food.  by the time we were ready for the check we really needed to hurry so i asked for it which fell on deaf ears.  i finally walked over to our server and stated we were pressed for time could we get our check and she said she was working on it.  we were extremely patient with the slow service but at this point the elderly woman waiting on us really could have cared less that we needed to hustle up.  food was ok.  my husband asked specifically if the machaca beef was made with egg and was told it was.  well it wasn't, basically just shredded beef.  have lived in phoenix for 30+ years and only been here once or twice (probably 25+ years ago).   will certainly not go out of my way to return.</b_review>
<b_review>the food was terrible. the service was terrible. it took a long time to get our food and some food came out before the rest.  the bus girl gave us better service than our server. we finished our drinks and not once did they ask if we wanted a refill. first and last time i go to this place.</b_review>
<b_review>la perla is a restaurant that has been through many changes.  some were good and some were bad.  in fact i think the food changes daily as well as the prices.  there was a time when i wouldn't step in the place, and there were other times when i couldn't have enough.  this is my second favorite of the old glendale restaurants.  their chips and salsa are outstanding.  i love their tacos and enchiladas as well as their rice and beans.  every once in a while the food is sometimes a little off or burnt, but overall still very good.  just a warning sometimes the food can be greasy and other times it can be very greasy.  it is all very flavorful and i would recommend it.</b_review>

<text>i don't really do the whole "hang out at a coffeebar" type thing, so my review is based only on the drink itself, which has been awesome every time i've been there.    best in the valley.   it's a shame central is such a pain.</text>
<u_review>if i were a vegetarian or super health conscious, this place would absolutely rock.  however, being a normal guy, this place is decent.  i like the occasional salad as much as the next guy, and they've got good ones.    the chicken isn't the best, but i like their house made flatbread.  i'd  eat here again if i were in the area.</u_review>
<u_review>this place is kinda out of place.  wait, that didn't make sense.  the vig is all kinds of incongruous.  is that better?    the outside, a plain, wood-planked facade on a lightly-traveled street, doesn't match the inside, a sleekly designed bar & dining area.  the inside, which looks straight out of scottsdale, doesn't match the more laid back neighborhood.  the menu, an ambitious attempt at upscale bar food with a touch of fine dining, doesn't match the bar atmosphere.    i went for lunch and had their house special burger.  it really was tasty, and paired with a few options, including a plie of shoestring fries or sweet potato fries, but, again, the identity crisis pops up.  it also comes with a little salad.  salad?  with a burger?  i'm eating a huge chunk of meat and deep-fried potatoes and now i'm gonna start eating healthy?    the vig tries to be so many different things at once, that it never really owns any one thing.  the face it shows is all scottsdale- posh with a hint of fake.    it really is an establishment in an identity crisis.</u_review>
<u_review>oh man, if you don't especially like your heart  (or at least can justify it by working out after), this is an awesome place.  i've been extremely skeptical of "chicago" places here in the valley, because most are bad impressions, at best.  this place doesn't *quite* get it, but it's the closest i've found in phoenix.    of course, they've got the chicago street signs and sports posters.  hey!  southport!  i lived right by there!  in case you missed the name of the place, they like reminding you by filling your vision with schtick.  the sliders, which aren't really known as a chicago thing, are really good, and quite cheap.  these are really tasty little burgers that make an inexpensive meal.    the italian beef, which *is* a chicago staple, just isn't quite right.  i think i figured out what it is.  the beef isn't sliced thinly enough and they don't use enough spices, which makes for a store-bought kinda feel to it.    props for the tasty milkshake, though.    i really, really want to find a place in phoenix to get a beef sandwich.   my search did not end here.    i am sean's unfulfilled yearning.</u_review>
<u_review>i really dig this place.  awesome decor, great mood lighting, really tasty menu, expansive wine list.  it's kind of an upscale take on mediterrenean food.  i had the chicken (which was perfectly juicy & tasty) with parmesan risotto & asparagus.  pretty good all the way around.  i'd definitely eat here again.</u_review>
<b_review>super cute cafe!! the latte macchiato was delicious and loved the presentation. i tried the farm vegetable eggs with potatoes and could not have made a better choice. very yummy!   the ambiance of the cafe is great. looks modern and feels comfy. only complaint which really isn't a complaint is that our food took a long time to come out. i've heard of others complaining of this before, but it's not necessarily a bad thing when you are having a catch up date with a friend. great place!!</b_review>
<b_review>great stop for a fast breakfast - the hubs had the puffed pancake with fruit on top (i loved how much fruit they loaded on it - and i got to eat it all because hubs doesn't like fruit so much). i got the oatmeal and a pastry - so good! the price was reasonable and i loved that it was all fresh and the flea market vibe the decor and seating offered. free wi-fi is a bonus too!</b_review>
<b_review>we kept seeing everyone check into this place and it had tons of reviews, so we knew we had to give it a go - and what a fun place! the line was really long when we walked in, but they whipped through it in no time and the woman taking the orders was really friendly and helped to make decisions since we were first timers and all.  she was very patient and answered all our questions (which we tried to keep short due to the line).  now, the place itself is super eclectic and there is art and decor to look at no matter where you sit on the inside.  the porch was packed, so we weren't able to enjoy the nice day outside, but the inside isn't a bad backup at all.  we got to sit next to marilyn monroe on a pink couch that was comfy and the wood slate table is something i would put in my house in a heartbeat.  our orders: me - a mocha with a crumb cake, his - vanilla latte with lemon cake.  we didn't realize until we were out of the line that they served full breakfast plates!  that'll happen next time for sure.  the coffees tasted great and the crumb cake was delicious.    overall: a fun and artsy with good coffee and pastries galore...yes, please!</b_review>
<b_review>i love lux! each time i order my cafe latte or au lait, i sprinkle sugar in the raw over the creamy froth and then inhale the coffee goodness before i begin drinking.  i have never had a bad coffee experience at lux and i have been there oh so very many times. but it is not only the coffee that is fantastic. be sure to try the toast. that's some tasty goodness! the other pastries are delicious (especially the brioche), but i find them to be a bit too pricey for my student budget.   the only other issue i have with lux is the outlet situation for laptops. there are very few and, especially on weekends, the coveted spots near the outlets are often taken. i guess you can look at it on the bright side- take the time instead of working to people watch, enjoy the music or read a good book.</b_review>

<text>it's hard to judge a restaurant based on a single visit with a large group, but service was so awful at this chompie's that there is no way i would ever make the drive to meet anyone at this location again.  a friend of mine was in town but only had limited time to meet up, so a group of about 15 people (plus three small children) decided to meet for lunch.  we did the smart things and called ahead to let them know that such a large party was planning to dine there at 1:30.  we were seated in a "party room" which had a tv, fireplace, and plenty of room, which was nice, but it also was dirty.  three tables had previous diners' dirty dishes and cutlery left on them.  the floor hadn't been swept.  and, one busser stopped in and cleaned off only one of those table during the two hours we were stuck in there.  so now for the real problem...  we were seated in this dirty room and after a few minutes a waiter came in.  we all ordered food and drinks.  it became very obvious the one server assigned to our group was overwhelmed.  it must have been at least 10 to 15 minutes before we started to see any of those drinks.  i don't know how long it takes to pour drinks for 15 people, but couldn't someone at least bring some pictures of water and glasses during that time?  drinks finally arrived.  then nothing.  it was an hour later when some pickles were brought to the table.  i'm not joking.  an hour later and our meals still weren't ready.  it was 2:30 in the afternoon.  i was planning on being at least getting ready to pay my bill by that time.  fortunately, none of the kids were complaining, but at least make sure they got their orders in a fair amount of time.  everyone was hungry.  neither the server nor the food were anywhere to be seen.  when our orders finally arrived at 3:00, the trays were placed on one the still dirty tables (a few of us noticed, but everyone was too hungry to complain).  the saving grace was that none of the orders were wrong.  the waiter was smart enough to bring free cookies with the bill, but the only reason none of us got a manger and complained was because it was nearly 3:30 and we all had places to go and just wanted to get out.  the one redeeming part of the visit is that the food is the same as every other chompie's.  which is excellent.  the ambiance is modern instead of old fashion deli.  but the service was a complete fail.  they knew a big group was coming, if they were unable to accommodate us, they should have warned us.</text>
<u_review>meat.  a whole lot of meat.  is there really anything else i need to say?  vegetarians and vegans may just want to skip this restaurant.  for those unfamiliar with the concept.  fogo de chao is like a buffet that comes to you.  for about $50, servers on carts move about the restaurant and will serve you a cut of whatever they are carrying.  it's not the best or most seasoned cuts you will ever consume, but you not leave dissatisfied or hungry.  there is also a pretty big "salad bar" that will get some greens and starches on your plate, but it's really not all that great.  fogo also caters well to bigger groups.  my party of 15 had no problem being promptly seated (with some arriving well before our reservation) and served.  i highly recommend dining at fogo with a group of carnivores when you have something to celebrate.</u_review>
<u_review>arrivederci is one of those little nice family owned restaurants that people keep kvetching the valley doesn't have enough of.  while it's not the best italian food in scottsdale, it serves up some wonderful meals at reasonable prices.  for me, it brings back memories of many little whole-in-the-wall italian restaurants my family and i used to visit when i was growing up in chicago and cleveland.  as others have said, the decor is awful but easy to look past.  the "rustic" wall paper and wine racks probably had an authentic old school feeling 20 years ago, but the dining room could drastically use a 21st century update.  the ferrari parked outside is cool for a quick glance, but really just serves as a fairly pointless "wow" device.  the food tastes fresh, the sauces are good but not overpowering to the dishes, and the service is great.  the only thing i don't recommend is the complimentary liquor shots we received at the end of our meal.  awful.  the server said it would help with digestion.  it left me feeling like i was suffering from indigestion.</u_review>
<u_review>cherry on top is a-ok for what it is, yet another self-serve frozen yogurt chain.  it has decent yogurt with quite a variety to pick from.  i didn't think any flavors that i tried were all that outstanding, but none were awful.  oddly, i didn't notice a cherry flavor (i may have just missed it).  there's also an okay selection of toppings.  i'm a little surprised that there was only one style of cherry to put on top of the bowl.  cherry has the dividers which can keep different flavors from touching in the cup.  i never seem to use it at the couple of places that offer, but i like it.  there's nothing unique about the shop.  the space is pretty big and the shop is clean.  it's laid out a lot like a zoyo, but painted bright white like a yogurtology or yogurtini.  it also has a tv with a looping slideshow of all the flavors that may be offered at any given time.  i get the idea, but i also feel like its teasing me when i see a flavor that isn't being offered that night that i would want to try.  as stated earlier, i would think that the owners would play up the cherry concept a little more to make something stand out.</u_review>
<u_review>in the year i have been working out at this la fitness, the experience has gone from adequate, to tolerable, to awful.   it pretty much goes back to la fitness' acquisition of pure fitness. ever since they shut down the location on rural, this location is always busy. there was barely enough equipment for the size of this gym's membership before all the pure fitness members came over. now it's a fight to get on a popular bench or machine. show up early if you want to have a quality work out.   on the plus side, i do enjoy the spin classes here. i highly recommend rachael's class on thursdays at 5:30pm. but as much as i enjoy the class, it's not enough to keep me working out here. i'm planning on moving, and will mostly likely cancel my membership unless i end up close to a decent la fitness.</u_review>
<b_review>i was very excited about eating here, especially after seeing all the goodies in the bakery cases- just like back east!  we went for a nice lunch on a saturday.  our waitress was over stretched with all the tables.  she was very nice but service was slow- not her fault.  the hot sandwich had to be returned because it was ice cold, the salad was runny, my matzo ball soup was very good, and so was everything else once it arrived. everything took forever to get, including the check.  she did take the salad off, but it took 20 minutes for her to return with the corrected check....over 2 hours later, lunch was over.  went to get some pastries from the bakery and stood at the register while they bakery girls stood talking and didn't acknowledge me.  tried a mini cannoli for $2.50.  the shell was soggy, like it was made yesterday.  a soggy shell is a major slip up.  thought the pastries were over priced.  wil i try them again, probably, but not anytime soon.  was very  disappointed.</b_review>
<b_review>great place to get a fantastic sandwich and they have a nice bakery too with cookies and breads.  i ordered aaron's choice (hot corned beef & pastrami, swiss cheese, coleslaw and 1000 island dressing on an onion roll) and it was fantastic.  two others in our group ordered the original jewish sliders (mini challah rolls filled with moist lean brisket, mini potato pancakes, and jack cheese with a side of gravy) and they could not eat them fast enough!  definitely check this place out!</b_review>
<b_review>i went to chompies for a quick bite during work after hearing the buzz  about the great ny style deli sandwiches on tap. i sat at the bar, though small, it obviously wouldn't be a place i would sit and have a few drinks after work. i was reminded by the manager that they now have a happy hour with $1 off drafts! good to know.   i had the hot pastrami sandwich with a cup of tortilla soup. the size of pastrami was very generous and i barely finished half. the pastrami was stacked 3 inches high and was so tender and juicy. i liked that it had a nice crust of peppery goodness on the edge of each slice. slap that on jewish rye and you're in business!  the soup was good, not great, but good. i don't think it had enough flavor, it was missing a hint of spice and more generous pieces of chicken. it didn't stand out to me.  my only gripe was the ny prices. out the door with tip was $21, so not an average lunch. i think that would be the only reason why i wouldn't frequent this place more often. jason's deli is right across the street and whereas chompie's pastrami sandwich is better, sadly i don't think it is that much better to warrant the price.   i'd definitely give it a go. next time i'll try a reuben!</b_review>
<b_review>coming from nyc i liked the nyc subway restaurant environment look and was really looking forward to a great lean hot pastrami on rye sandwich. unfortunately the sandwich disappointed me. the meat had a lot of fat and its taste was not the same as you would kind in a kosher deli restaurant in nyc or in miami (jerry's deli). the service was also slow.</b_review>

<text>if you don't love it, you don't get it.  make an evening of the bianco's experience.  here's how:  when you arrive, walk inside and put your name on the wait list.  they will tell you an astonishing number like, "your table will be ready in three hours."  don't worry, waiting is just as fun as eating there.  proceed next door to the wine bar.  order an appetizer and a bottle of wine.  enjoy the company of your friends.  slow yourself down, relaaaaax.  order another bottle of wine.  at some point midway through this bottle your table will be ready, if you do it right.  i have never waited the actual time quoted by the hostess (or it didn't seem like it because i was having fun).  after a few glasses of wine, and the fun but hefty wait, your food will taste better than if you had gotten it instantly--  i promise.  after getting your table, continue to relax and enjoy yourself.  you waited for this table, and it is yours.  i recommend that you order at least one more pizza than you think you want, because you will want it, if not right then, at least later.  have another bottle of wine with your food.  here is what to order:  margherita - tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil   rosa - red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, az pistachios   biancoverde - fresh mozzarella, parmigiano reggiano, ricotta, arugula  +++ add crimini mushrooms   again, if you try it, and you don't like it, that says more about you than the place.  it is okay though!  bianco's is not for everyone.  walmart is for everyone, and look what that place is like!  the difference is, this restaurant is notpretentious.  the owner cooks the pizza right in front of you, while watching suns games with his cap on backwards.  if you don't think you can handle the wait, i have a simple solution:  go anywhere else.  excercise your freedom of choice!</text>
<u_review>persian cuisine has a special place in my belly.  i love middle eastern food when it is done right.  tasty kabob is a paradise for vegetarians and carnivores, and i often visit this place in the unnatural company of each.    it is a sit-down restaurant, the service is good, and they have take out if you are staying in.  all three of their stews are fantastic, and everything i have ever eaten there has been a delight.</u_review>
<u_review>a real dive.  cheap drinks!  4 cocktails and a beer came out to $14.50!  the bartender was at least 75 years old, and she was a sweet as a southern belle, but i bet she doesn't take crap from anyone.  she said she had worked there for 30 years, and i believe her!  hell of a great place.  friendly crowd of regulars.</u_review>
<u_review>over the years i have owned several vintage bmw and honda motorcycles, and this place has always been my go-to spot for the hondas.   the staff here have been helpful helping me find parts, and the mechanics have done work on several of my bikes.   i work on my own bmw, so i am not sure if they would service a vintage bmw or not. nonetheless, i have been here about a dozen times, i have referred friends with bikes to go to d & d, and in all cases it has been a positive experience.</u_review>
<u_review>their sausages are made by a place called schreiners fine sausages.  if you don't like the casing on your dog to snap when you bite into it, this is not the place for you.  the food is good, and they have interesting menu options.  everything from saurkraut and swiss to peanut butter and bacon.  they also sell a hand battered corn dog, coleslaw, fried pickles, and kettle chips.  a highlight are the fried pickles.  they are great by themselves or as a topping on your dog.  i was underwhelmed by the coleslaw--it was good, but not great.  if the coleslaw had more flavor, and the batter on the corn dog was a little sweeter, i would give this place a solid 5.  4 stars ain't bad though.  i will definately be back to try the "bear."  bear (7th inning stretch) peanut butter, cracker jacks, smoked gouda, bacon and bbq sauce.  it takes stones to have something like this on your menu, and perhaps equal stones to order it.  i love it when a solid business has a challenging menu item for the public to wax and wane over trying.</u_review>
<b_review>do not believe the hype.  you must go there and try it yourself.  the ingredients grown by the owner an the pizza dough is the best i have ever had.  the toppings are fresh full of flavor.  may be the best pizza ever.</b_review>
<b_review>i have been to pizzeria bianco a few times now and have loved every visit!   my trick is to get there around 4:15 (during months when the weather is nice), get in line, and send someone to the bar to grab drinks to make waiting in line a little bit more enjoyable.  doors open at 5, you get in with the first seating and you're good to go.  or, if you don't get in the first seating, you put your name on the list (maybe a 45-60 min wait) and you go find a table in the bar and order an appetizer.  my first trip to bianco, i was wondering if i would be able to tell if it really was better than the rest.  (please note, this was several years ago when i was early in my "good pizza" knowledge).    for me, this pizza got better with every bite.  it went something like . . .  first bite:  yeah, this is good. second bite:  wow, i really like this sauce. third bite:  man, these tomatoes are really fresh! fourth bite:  ok, i'm impressed, the sausage isn't greasy at all!  the wiseguy and the margarita are my favorites.  oh, and i really love that arugula one.  ok, they are all great.  they have a great antipasto platter too!  i understand that people are frustrated by the long wait and the small space.  what i don't understand are all of the demands or suggestions.   "bianco needs to do something about the long wait." "they need to serve us faster." "they need a bigger space." they need to do this . . . they should really do that . . .  the way i see it, they really don't have to do anything!  it seems to me their business is running quite well as it is.  if they choose not to open up more tables, or get a bigger space, or whatever it is, at the risk of lowering the quality of the food, then i have to respect that.  just my two cents.  take it or leave it.</b_review>
<b_review>i moved to phx about 6 months and since the beginning i have been hearing about pizzeria bianco. i also heard how freakin long you need to wait to get in. i tried it once at night and after an hour and 15 minutes i gave up. i couldn't help but wonder  1. why don't they serve food outside? 2. why don't they make the restaurant bigger? 3. does the owner want to keep it small despite the negative experience for many people who have to wait for forever or just don't go because they don't want the hassle?  well, they they started serving lunch. usually it's too far for me to run to during the work week but i happened to have a random day off and luckily i put this on my list.  i was so happy to show up and see plenty of seats for me to choose from at the bar. hallelujah, let's see what the fuss is all about. i had a tasty coke from a bottle (i'm rarely a caffeine drinker) and ordered the margherita after debating whether to go red or white. 5 minutes after i ordered the friendly waitress told another customer at the bar that you could split the pizza and do half and half for yourself. wish i woulda known!  it took awhile to get my pizza but it was damn tasty. maybe a 20-30 min wait tasty, but not a 4 hour wait tasty. still good, still glad i went, still want to go again, definitely not at night, but lunch is my saving grace.</b_review>
<b_review>wow! this place lives up to its reputation. and i can honestly say it has one of the best if not best dough and crust that i have ever had. plus the ingredients just taste fresh. most of the pizzas you order here will not have more than 3-4 toppings, so it is simplistic. but these are some very very delicious simplistic pizzas.   my friends and i had the mozzarella and tomatoes then ordered the margherita, biancoverde, and the one with sausage (can't remember the name of this pizza). every single one of the pizzas had the right amount of cheese and the combination was thoroughly entertaining my palate.   here's a tip: if you come for dinner here you will probably wait for over 1-2hours. but they are now open for lunch which means you can get there at 11 and get a seat right away!</b_review>

<text>in proper jamie fashion i'm making bosa my 60th review. fortunately for me i live less than 10 minutes from this place. if i were ruler of the world there would be 24 hour donut joints like this within walking distance in every community. their donuts are always fresh however, the full selection is not always available as they sell out quick. my favorites are the dozen donut holes for a $1, chocolate glaze, and sugar. the denseness of these donuts are spot on (gooey, chewy and airy all at the same time). sweet but not overly so. i've even had their breakfast croissant which consisted of ham, cheese, jalapeno. it was good but the main attraction here is the donut so don't go here expecting gourmet anything else. the coffee is okay nothing to rave about but decently pairs with donut.  beware of the service charge on your debit card if you don't spend at least $5. service can be spotty depending on who's working (the elderly woman is much more cordial than the teenagers that sometimes staff the restaurant). bosa is a great way to satisfy your fried dough cravings. ps- yes these donuts are better than dunkin and krispy kreme.</text>
<u_review>this review is for take-out service only: i frequently go to this native to get hot wings on my way home from work. when you call you can expect to almost always be placed on hold before putting in your order. the time they quote is usually spot on. however, how you pick-up the wings is kind of inconsistent. sometimes, they ask for the color and make of your car and meet you in the take-out order parking lot; other times you have to go to the door and ask for your order. my order is always correct and the wings are still crispy when i get home, so overall this is still a convenient and good place for wings.</u_review>
<u_review>when you go to a place called "fajitas" you order the dang namesake! i've had all the different fajitas they offer and i love all them, my favorite is the shrimp it's lightly seasoned and grilled to perfection (side note: order the onions and pepper caramelized)! the tortillas are strong enough to fold without tearing yet still have a nice flavor. the toppings are always bright and fresh, the guacamole is legit. my coworker has talked me into always ordering a side of queso with the free chips and salsa. albeit the restaurant is old but the staff is super friendly and detail oriented. and yes, no matter what you order you will smell like fajitas so make sure you don't have anywhere special to go after eating here.</u_review>
<u_review>this place is amazing!!! "multi-tainment" center perfectly describes this place. you can eat, lounge, bowl, play and watch movies all in the same place! this place houses 3 restaurants (347 grill, luxe and cones café) the 347 grill and the luxe share the same kitchen, so you'll get the same food quality. the biggest difference between the two is the 347 grill is family friendly and the luxe is for adults only with more emphasis on the drinks as the bar anchors this lounge/restaurant. my group ate at the luxe due to the wait at grill 347; the food was okay nothing to scream about good enough to keep the night festive, the price points were dead on. i had the mediterranean salad which was well balanced and good in size however i wish the cucumbers were more freshly cut.  my husband ordered the honey bbq wings which were good in size, well sauced and crunchy, yum! the other people in my party all enjoyed their food as well. after dinner we headed over to the ultra star cinemas for a movie. for an additional $2.50 you can upgrade to the "star class" area upstairs and view your movie minor free with drink and waiter service, score!!! i didn't get a chance to bowl at the "tin pens" bowling alley but next time i definitely will. the arcade was decent. what i like most about this place is the open concept, there are plenty of areas to lounge all around and all the areas of interest seem to flow harmoniously into one another.  give this place a try you'll be sure to love it! i'm happy i finally have a place to go when i'm in maricopa!!! ps- they have laser tag too!</u_review>
<u_review>legit smoothie place. i prefer jamba juice but this place fits the bill when i'm in need of something healthy to drink near my job. the prices are slightly higher than jamba too. make sure to check the back table before ordering, they often have coupons sitting there waiting to be claimed. the service is okay. they have a limited food menu but i've never tried any food because nothing seems appealing.</u_review>
<b_review>if there is one thing lacking in the valley it's good independent donut shops. luckily i don't live too far from bosa donuts in chandler. but these donuts are worth the drive, wherever you might be coming from.  bosa is open 24-7 which makes it perfect for late night donut cravings or lazy sunday mornings. they have a decent variety. a mix of raised, cake, and filled. my favorites are the glazed twist (so good!) and their old fashioned donuts. the cream filled are also tasty and the boyfriend loves the jelly filled.   this place is cheap too. got 6 donuts the other day for $4. can't beat it. the atmosphere is nothing to write home about and at times can feel a little creepy so we always just get our donuts to go.  in my opinion this isn't just the best donut shop in chandler, it's the best in the valley.</b_review>
<b_review>it's hard to find a good local donut place nearby, but this is it!  awesome, fabulous, yummy donuts.  great prices, fast service, plus a drive through.  loves.</b_review>
<b_review>this is the only place i come to when i have a donut craving. much better quality , taste and price than krispy kremes and dunkin donuts. they are always open, fully stocked and i have yet to have a bad experience of a stale donut. the ladies behind the counter are always nice, patient, and willing to answer questions. it also doesn't hurt that they have a fridge with a wide selection of breakfast/dairy beverages. i love these donuts because they taste great and the texture is even better. its a great balance between the fluffy interior and subtle crunchy exterior.</b_review>
<b_review>love this place i will drive the extra 4 miles to get it at least twice a week!! their cherry sprinkles, bear claw and long johns are mmmm mmmm good!!!!</b_review>

<text>loved this place!   i ordered the fish and chips and they live up to the "raves" on yelp!  the batter was not at all over powering and gave just the right bit of crunch.  loved the hand cut fries as well...doused in some yummy malt vinegar and a big helping of some hard cider...i was happy!</text>
<u_review>the 2 stars is mainly for the service.  they were extremely slow!  i have visited other chipotle locations and even when there's a line, they are fast and friendly.  when i finally got to the register, the girl at the register had to ask me 3 times what i ordered and even though i told her 4 times that i wanted a large drink, she kept handing me the small drink.  maybe it was because she was more concerned with a co-worker (who had either just gotten off of work or was on break) telling her a story about a friend of his who was having a baby.  it was pretty ridiculous considering the growing line of customers behind me.    the food as usual is delicious! can never go wrong with a chicken burrito bowl!  however, the guy who was taking the order was in a huge hurry (there was a long line as usual during lunch) and put less than 1/2 the amount of rice and beans than what is usually put into the bowl.  i had to ask for a little more of each.  when i asked for extra lettuce, the girl putting it on gave me a look like "really?" and begrudgingly gave me extra lettuce.    i think i will be heading east to the chipotle in avondale next time.  i've never had a problem at that location.  p.s.  parking is not the greatest here!</u_review>
<u_review>fig on a pizza? yes please!  add some prosciutto? yes, please some more!  good wine, great company and thin crust that doesn't overpower the flavors on a piece of pizza pie...i'll be back!</u_review>
<u_review>they do have some really cute stuff, but this whole new pricing thing...it blows.  things were so much more less expensive before...  however, if they'd follow suit with other jcp's and add a sephora...i'd be there weekly!</u_review>
<u_review>this place has great lunch specials! i have never been disappointed in the pizza here!    tons of toppings on my fave...joey's favorite (minus the onions). their antipasto is to die for with tons of flavor and endless goodness!   my boyfriend loved the pizza and the wings!</u_review>
<b_review>i enjoy "the bop" as my friend calls it on the same level that i enjoy pizza.  it's good, but it's not my desert island bar.  i go here to meet up with friends.  i've never been there on my own because let's face it.  i'm not likely to be caught dead trolling scottsdale (even non-scottsdale scottsdale) by my lonesome.  the atmosphere is cozy and inviting.  which kinda turns me off. i like my bars a bit seedier.  but if that's your thing then i'm cool with it.  i hear the food is pretty good for english fare, but hey who wants to waste time eating when you could be drinking?</b_review>
<b_review>keep your expectations low and you can't go wrong with this pub. don't be put off by the slightly greasy menu with a few items crossed out with sharpie. there are plenty of delicious bar food dishes to choose from. ignore the fact that the server is wearing an over-sized tank top and her hair looks a bit dirty. she is extremely friendly and will take good care of you. there is live music, and sure, he might be drunk, but he will have you singing along to his version of tom petty in no time. and if that isn't enough entertainment for you, they have darts, plenty of tvs, and a pool table, plus, just people watching can keep you laughing and ordering another round for hours.</b_review>
<b_review>i also come here on tuesday nights for their weekly trivia night! best time to come and put your brain to work. the place is usually pretty popular for trivia nights but they do take reservations so you can save a space for you and your large group and not have to fight for spots each week or show up super early to save a seat.   they run happy hour specials during this time to so you won't be breaking the bank if you don't win the trivia prize. they have plenty of good beers to choose from and the food is alright. not amazing food but it's your typical bar/pub food. because its so busy on these nights the service can be a bit slow but you have the trivia questions to distract you and plus the staff is so friendly you can't blame them.</b_review>
<b_review>i thought i'd found the perfect after-work watering hole. it combines my favorite aspects of a neighborhood pub - pool table, juke box, great beers on tap, fairly authentic brit-pub ambiance, and a pretty good food menu. the waitstaff is nice, and it has a cheers-like local atmosphere. the tvs with various sporting events is a great touch, too. i live in s. scottsdale, and would much rather hang out at a place like this than say, tt roadhouse (too cramped), pattie's (too frat boy having his first beer-ish), coach house (too full of it's own divey self), or a few others around here. i was thinking "4 stars".  then i get home and notice they bait-and-switched me on a food item - bread pudding (very good, yes), it was $3.95 on the menu, and $4.95 on my bill (i'm really not cheap. it's the principle of the thing - charge what's on the damn menu, or change your menu. it's called "false advertising". should i have made a stink about a buck?  she probably bet i wouldn't notice, which is all the more insulting).   also, the beers at happy hour were $4.25. really? you guys can't do better than that? i know of a dozen places that do $3 pints and even less than that at the old hh. i mean, your place is chill, clean, service is good, but...come on. oh, it's...scottsdale. duh.   i'll come back someday, but i'm not in a hurry to.</b_review>

<text>one of the most relaxing places that's within biking distance from my house. i, am indeed, one lucky gal!   while it's not huge, the farm can keep me occupied for hours on end. i just love the serenity and beauty of it all, and taking time to breathe deeply and enjoy the little things in life.   the maya farm apparently has amazing csa shares i am going to buy into shortly that include flowers. i buy myself flowers every week, so this is a super fantastic deal :)  the little art shops and gardens are just beautiful and everyone is so nice and kind. i spent quite a bit of my stay there today playing with an adorable boston terrier.   downfall is the lack of good places i felt safe parking my bike. bonus is i just brought it with me (consider it my dog) wherever i traveled.   i will be back here... again.. and again.. it's a great weekend morning trip. i took some fantabulous photos today.</text>
<u_review>abridged:  just go. every bad review you've read has been wrong.  unabridged: i was worried. afraid. scared of heading to big earl's after the reviews i read that it just wasn't up to par. i'm so glad didn't listen and went anyway.  i guess i'm glad i walked in the side entrance because i didn't see the big display of tshirts martin mentioned in his new times review. or they just aren't as out there. or i was just really craving food. either way, now that i'm thinking of martin, i wonder if he knows he's on a big framed banned poster hanging up at big earl's.  the place could benefit from some decor change, but i honestly think it's still that way for the mere fact that it's in old town. i bet those business buildings have hoas. tuscan/crap/southwestern style or die....  but. i digress...  usually when i see lunch menu options at a bbq place i tend to want to skip them b/c i think they're going to be ruined 'by the bun" and just a small icky amount of what i want to enjoy. looking at the prices and sizes of the lunch and dinner menu though, i could tell big earl's was some serious shit. serious. it was hard to make a choice. they have desserts with chocolate whip people... chocolate whip. i almost avoided real lunch food altogether. they have a leg of beast feast... folks.. if you got this for carry out, i'm not sure how it would fit in your car. but i can guarantee you'd eat it all.   so what did i get?  the kentucky mule is bourbon and ginger beer. and it was perfect.   i was the only one in my group to ever have fried pickles before, and i was curious as to if they were as bad as mentioned before, so i ordered them. they were perfect. i have yet to see fried pickles done as well in this area as they are at earl's. i have turned several people into fried pickle enthusiasts!!  then i ordered the pulled pork sandwich and mac & cheese. and i was full. this was the largest lunch i've ever seen. the bun at first looks like a cheap attempt at a bun, but it compliments the pork perfectly. their sweet & spicy sauce is my favorite and the mac & cheese was to die for.  as we finished, tony, who cooks and created the sauces, came over to our table to give us a chance to let him know what he can fix. one of my table guests sarcastically complained about the mac & cheese he devoured. the result? we were brought out another side of deep fried mac & cheese. holy hell!!   this place is amazing. the food is stellar. drinks are great. prices are very reasonable for the quantity and quality and i would come back again in a heartbeat. have i convinced a gaggle of you to come with for the leg of beast feast??? i don't want to eat it myself, but i have to admit, i'm hella curious.</u_review>
<u_review>all hail the server that gave me a to go container of the caramel popcorn on my way out! there's a deeper, sexier story about the caramel popcorn.. but i'll get back to that.  now that i have your attention... ;)  what a nice little place this is. i was there on a thursday night and it was rather peaceful and quiet. the relaxing atmosphere was just what the doctor ordered on a night of catching up with a friend i haven't seen in awhile.  while it seems small, i am amazed at how much space there really is there.   i started with an arnold palmer which was delicious. so much so, that i stayed with it the entire night. everything on the menu to me looked good, but nothing really stood out as fantastic-i-have-to-have-that-right-now good. craving flavor, as i have been lately, i went with the green chile stew item. while small, it was the right amount of food and had a pretty good flavor.   the killer part of the night though was the dessert that we shouldn't have had but decided to share. the one both of us agreed on was the chocolate cake with caramel. we were expecting cake. we were expecting gelato. we were expecting caramel. we were not expecting caramel corn.   holy mouthgasm st. francis!   i'm not a fan of super sweet things so the mix of the salty totally did me in and we found ourselves eating almost every last bit of that cake. heaven. try that cake! at one point i believe i mentioned i wanted to marry whomever is responsible.  in the end, the dessert was fantastic and the mood was great, but none of the dishes screamed at me. i may be back for that cake though.</u_review>
<u_review>if i'm a fan of a pasta place, you know it's pretty much awesome. especially if i'd go there again.   the atmosphere is awesome and the whole vibe of the restaurant is very relaxing but in an elegant, royal, sexy way. the gorgeous reds mixed with copper make me swoon. enter a gorgeous waiter and i might try to live there.   both times i have been at bada boom i have had fantastic food. it was prepared well, presented well, and served within a reasonable amount of time. there are always several items on the menu i am dying to try, which says a lot as i don't like tomatoes or red sauce all that much.   on one occasion i was there, it was a little rowdy at the bar area, but fortunately the main dining area is completely separated by the courtyard entrance and is not a distraction at all.</u_review>
<u_review>i have a backlog of 20 something reviews, but i had to write this review immediately. why? because i wasn't allowed to have lunch unless i was eating for four.   you're probably asking yourself if i'm serious or if there was something special going on. i assure you i am completely serious and i didn't see anything special.  everytime i go to my krav maga classes or swadee, i stare at ikitchen and wonder what it is. one time i had an in depth conversation with a friend over what the name implies. is it serve yourself? did they just think if they stick an i on it, people will come? do they sell self-serving stoves and kitchen appliances?  today it was enough to make me wander in. i saw some pretty good yelp reviews and my curiosity couldn't stand it any longer. the menu looked pretty delicious. after looking over the various noodle, rice and ramen dishes along with the incredibly tempting flavors of smoothies (cookies and cream, green tea... mango mmm), i decided to try a bowl, which serves one and comes with rice and a salad and an appetizer just to have an assortment.  as soon as i said orange chicken bowl, i was shot down. apparently bowls (which are the items that serve one person) are only served during lunch hours on weekdays. dishes are served all the time and serve 4 people. i told her i wasn't hungry for a dish and didn't have 3 other people. i would've paid a slightly higher price for a bowl, but instead they let me walk out hungry. the smoothie was still tempting, but i was not about to give them my service. i'll hit up my local fro-yo place instead... and order chinese take-out elsewhere.  unless it's that time of the month for you ladies, you haven't eaten in four days, or you have a large party of people that like the same thing... or it's a weekday lunch, i'd head elsewhere.</u_review>
<b_review>i love the atmosphere here but the food has taken a turn for the worst.  this used to be my favorite breakfast place but something has changed.  the food looks like the chef does not care.  there was no garnish on the plate, my eggs were cold.  my friend's waffles were burnt.  this is a lovely place to visit with a friendly wait staff but i do not recommend the food.</b_review>
<b_review>i can't tell you enough how much i love this place. i love the scenery, it's like you're not in phoenix anymore. the farm has three places to eat, i am more of a picnic girl, specifically because i know i can get sweet potato salad and a portobello sandwich and frolick in the grass. okay, so i don't frolick, but i do sit on a cute bench. everytime i'm there they have a new soup! it's like a birthday present midweek i swear. the weddings are beautiful there and morning glory is good for company in town.</b_review>
<b_review>i'd heard of this place time and time again. so i finally thought i'd give it a whirl. when you're driving there from the fwy, you think you're in the wrong place: industrial, low income homes, etc. but when you drive in you feel like you're some place else,not a big city like phoenix. there are two restaurants to choose from. but since everyone seemed to crowd to the one at the end of the road, so did i. don't go w/heels or nice shoes. there is no pavement or set pathway. you will step on rocks, dirt, possibly mud and wood chips. i guess it adds to the 'feel'. there is a quaint little gift shop, and the art coordinator, carol is very sweet and helpful. the food was good. i mean, to know you are eating fresh, local produce, etc.....why not?! i got the south mountain omelet, although it would've been better w/avocado, it was pretty good. i'll bring my toddler next time and see how it goes for the 'kids opinion'. but....you should check it out and let your belly do the decision making.  *ps. there is a bit too many flies around, but you're at a farm & food. also, people are allowed to bring there dogs, which is nice if people are good owners, but i really don't want a shedding dog around to have his hair fly into my food. blah! don't get married there. there was a wedding going on along the dirt road where you enter/exit. poor things had bikers roaring out past them as they were probably saying there vows.</b_review>
<b_review>the morning glory cafe is excellent.  my boyfriend took me here for the first time to meet some of his family, and i just fell in love.  i like the atmosphere and the food is hearty.  i scheduled a morning brunch with all of my girlfriends there a few weeks ago and it went off without a hitch.  the staff is great!</b_review>

<text>this place depresses me.  yes, they have made efforts to "fix it up", but it's really just a sad has-been.  if you need to run an errand to a very specific store, you'll be ok.  but this is not the mall where you want to slowly window shop.  if you head over here, it'll likely be for the costco, movie theatre (nice), or the supertarget.  warning:  unless you go before 10am, the walmart is frightful.</text>
<u_review>one evening i had hungry, loud, complaining kids in my car and, out of sheer desperation, i turned into the drive through of this completely  non-descript "berto's" looking kind of restaurant.  what a find!  outstanding food, fast, cheap.  happy day, happy kids.  we've been back a few times for pick-up.  no ambience, but that's not what they are about. expect really good really reliable old school mexican food.</u_review>
<u_review>i take my children to great clips.  on this particular visit, we arrived around 8pm, and were informed of a short wait.  we waited about 10 minutes before the first daughter was called back for her wash and cut.  within another 10 minutes, the other daughter went back.  both were given personalized attention and enjoyed the scalp massage with the shampoo.  both haircuts came out fine, symmetrical, etc.  friendly and efficient hair cutters.  price for 2 cuts, including shampoo and tip:  $34.00  ~~ and the girls were happy with the results.  we will return to this location.</u_review>
<u_review>my previous review has the real details about what i love about their food!  update:  doing mostly take-out here, but at least one of the grumpy girls is more friendly now!  yesterday when i grabbed our to-go order, she smiled, made small conversation, and did not exude a sullen disposition in any way.  i'm happy for me, i'm happy for her!  ordered many of our usual items, plus mongolian beef, which was very tasty. i'm stil partial to the ginger beef, however.</u_review>
<u_review>i don't want to wax nostalgic here, but i have fond memories of a spaghetti factory from long ago.  numerous trips to the library or art museum in phoenix, followed by a trip to the this location.   in the early to mid 1980's i remember the tempe location serving hungry college students 2 for 1 meal  specials on  sunday afternoons.  in more recent years, this phoenix location has been a family favorite, suitable for get-togethers, child friendly, centrally located.    a few years ago, i would be giving a 4 star rating. my most recent visits have spaghetti factory at a solid 3.  why, you ask?  well, i'm happy to share!  keep in mind the name of this restaurant:  spaghetti factory.    the menu:  what was once an easy to navigate document is now overloaded with too many options.  spaghetti is buried in the middle of the book.    let's face it folks, spaghetti is cheap. keep the menu simple, with its namesake food easy to find.    more frustrating is the lunch structure.  for years one could get their favorite spaghetti and sauce combos in a smaller quantities, with drink and spumoni inclusive, for a reduced rate.  now, lunch options are salads or sandwiches, with a pasta option offered as a note at the top.  no drink or spumoni option, unless you buy the dinner size.  why???    thank goodness they've kept their pasta sauces the same.  you can't go wrong with any of them- one of my favorites is the spaghetti with half meat sauce and half brown butter mizithra cheese.  sublime!  the mushroom sauce is another tempting choice.  my husband loves the clam sauce, and my kids are all over the board.    i like the addition of the option for steamed broccoli in large quantity- an excellent option for a large family gathering.  salads are still crisp and cold, dressings still fresh, bread still warm and tasty.  i've ordered salad entrees, great quality and balance of flavors.  really, no complaints about the food, but the food is not all there is to a good rating.  combine the lack of menu focus and lost menu options with consistantly (last 4 visits) slow food service, and we move from a 4 to a 3.  servers are friendly enough, but it seems that everyone is moving in slow motion, save for a couple managers and long-term servers, scurrying about.    just a little tightening up on service, plus a simplification of menu (bring back the lunch drink option), and i think we could hit the 4 star zone once again.</u_review>
<b_review>thirteen places that sell shoes??? run down, small, hard to get in and out of and clientele is very low on the socioeconomic ladder. do yourself a favor and skip this mess!</b_review>
<b_review>sigh...  i wanted this to have more stars, but 3 is really pushing it.  there are some great things about this place but then there are some.... not so great ones.  this is like the little mall that could in many ways.  i remember coming here as a kid to get my picture with santa and to see the gigantic sand castles that they would have on display every year.  (different times of year.)  i remember thinking how cool it was to take the escalator up to the movie theater.  so here's where we are now.  really good things:  - where else are you going to shop?  there is so little good shopping when you live in/near this area.  - there is a costco.  this brings up the status level of just about anywhere, let's be honest.  this was my main costco for a long time.    - the chinese food restaurant is pretty cool.  - i love the old school deli!  it totally feels 1975 when i go there.  - they haven't tried to overly modernize.  sound like a dubious "good thing" but i love the old school brick work walk ways and planters.    - new shops like ross and petsmart have really helped the place!  not so good things:  - this was the nastiest wal-mart i've ever been in. i'm already not a wal-mart fan, but there were a few times when i needed something fast and well, it was there.  walking through there during christmas for freaking ornament hangers was one of my worst experiences ever.  - can you call this a food court?  it's almost hidden and for good reason.  there aren't many reasons to eat there, and there are many reasons not to.  it's not ghetto.  it's old school.  know what to expect going in (lots of shoe and accessory stores and nothing in the way of high fashion) and it can be an oasis of shopping in the middle of a shopping desert.</b_review>
<b_review>i should have read the reviews before going. it was recommended by the concierge as a good mall on the light rail. the other reviewer, chad, had it completely right - it's a dive.  it was dark, dingy, and overall a bit sketchy. walking to it from the light rail was a longer walk than i was led to believe. one has to trek through a huge parking lot and it feels like over a block or two walk.   the "food court" includes an o'charley's sandwich shop and the food from the costco. while a $1.50 hot dog & drink is a good deal, i was hoping for something a bit healthier.  advice: if you're a tourist, find a different mall to visit.</b_review>
<b_review>anyone remember valley west mall on 50th ave & northern right before it closed?    that's what chris-town spectrum mall feels like..    my aunt worked here when i was a kid and that was back in the 80s when the mall was thriving with business and there were always a ton of great people walking around.  the food court  wasn't there just yet, but when that opened it gave it an even greater feel.    but now..  chris-town... or face it.. lets just call it spectrum mall, is nothing but a ghetto run down store with a bunch of jewelry and urban clothing stores.  i'm shocked that they even have a nail shop inside... i dont mean an upper class one, i mean the ones you see in a strip mall.  the only stores that are recognizable are gnc, bath & body works and shockingly... wing stop.. why the hell would they put a wing stop in there? wow..  big 5 sports is pretty decent i guess too..  i give this two stars because what was once a great mall is now nothing.  in my honest opinion, they should shut down the remaining mall section and just rebuild it as more big stores..  the only reason people go here now is harkins, wal-mart, target and jc penny's..  oh and costco.   think about it... what mall has all those outside stores attached to them?  none that i can think of.. unless they're hurting.  rip chris-town</b_review>

<text>we heard fair trade cafe served vegan options and vegetarian lunch dishes, so we wanted to check it out. we aren't coffee drinkers - so this is only a food review.we rode our bikes over to fair trade on a sunday. i was really into the mood for a veggie sandwich, and voila! they had one on their menu.   i ordered the veggie panini. when it arrived, the bread was really oily and there were no condiments on the sandwich, at all! just bread and vegetables and a slice of cheese. they could have added anything to it: pesto, cream cheese, mustard -- nothing. the sandwich was $7 and came with chips (wish they had a healthier alternative for a side).   my boyfriend had the breakfast sandwich and said it was fair. his was only $4.    probably won't eat here again.</text>
<u_review>we stopped at mellow mushroom this afternoon for late lunch/early dinner. the experience was overall very frustrating. the food was 3 stars, but the service was a one star.   we waited about 10minutes to order, no big deal. boyfriend created his own sandwich. i wanted pizza -- they let me know that they offer vegan options for pizza. our server told me if i order the mega veggie pizza, they would just make it vegan for no extra cost (no butter on crust, no egg, sub daiya cheese for regular and add tofu). awesome, right?  we waited for forty five minutes for our food -- and we were one of six tables out of at least 30 available. they were slow, yet our server never came by to apologize for the wait or let us know it'd be coming out any minute.   we finally got our food. boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich -- my pizza was pretty good. i loved that they use daiya cheese and not some soy crap.   we get our check -- his sandwich was $13 (french bread, avocado, salami, pesto mayo, caramelized onions, spring mix) - a little on the pricy side. he enjoyed it, but definitely said it wasn't worth the price.  my 14" pizza was $19.50 + $3.99 for cheese. they added $4 for my 'vegan' cheese which i did not ask for (had i known, i would've just gotten veggies). i asked our server why this was... she gave me some attitude about how she's new and made a mistake. didn't apologize -- didn't offer to take it off -- she even mentioned her manager knew she told me the wrong price. her manager was aware and didn't come by. why not ask me if i want to pay an extra $4 before placing the order with the kitchen? no apologies, no discount and attitude on top of it. super lame. that was not a $25 pizza.   food was okay, definitely not coming back and not recommending this to anyone.</u_review>
<u_review>i can (and sometimes do) eat here two or more times a week. their salsa bar is the best (pecan, mexicana, cilantro are my favorite -- i still haven't tried their strawberry salsa everyone raves about as it's not in season). their veggie burrito is the most amazing i've ever had anywhere. no, seriously. it's true. now they even offer a vegan version, but that oaxacan cheese is too good to pass up. my meat eating friends love this place, too.   i'd give them 5 stars, but their service is a bit slow and you may need to fill up your own water glass or go up front to pay your bill.</u_review>
<u_review>i went to sushi roku for the first time last night because i had purchased a groupon for $40 dinner. i'm probably never coming back.  we ordered: -edamame hummus with wonton chips (not so good.. bland.. weird texture) - mackerel sashimi 4 pc (best thing we had) - eel and avocado roll (2nd best but very average) - shrimp tempura with asparagus (less than average, not crunchy at all) - crunchy tuna roll with avocado (terrible. it was not crunchy, it was mushy) - peach saketini (i enjoyed this).   the best part about dinner was the mackerel sashimi.  our waiter told us to look on the first page of the menu because those items were 'the freshest'.. made me nervous. is everything else not as fresh??  service from the sushi chefs was great. service from the waiter was awful. he didn't come up to us for nearly an hour. we waited for our check for 15 minutes after i asked for it. there were only 4 parties in the whole restaurant.  had i not had a coupon, i would not have gone and i'll probably never come back. there are tons of sushi places in the phoenix area that are much better and cheaper.   aesthetically, the bar is set up nicely. the sushi bar has a neat tree centerpiece. but the hostesses look like trash and the waiters are too busy huddled in a corner to notice their parties.</u_review>
<u_review>i don't know how much worse this place can be. i tried the happy valley location with an awful experience a year ago and decided to give mellow mushroom another chance when they had a groupon. bad idea.  the first incident of this meal was getting a dirty water glass. this wasn't just 'dirty,' it was caked with food on the bottom. i didn't notice for a second.. there was food floating in my water.. and when i took a closer look, the bottom of the glass had dough or some sort of sauce sitting there looking back at me. our server didn't seem surprised and didn't apologize. i guess this happens all the time? i asked for my water in a to-go cup.   we waited over 30min on a wednesday evening to get our small pizza and sandwich -- with less than half the restaurant full. our waiter was nowhere to be found for water refills.   i ordered a small mega-veggie pizza and my boyfriend ordered their steak and cheese hoagie. this was probably the worst veggie pizza i've ever had. there's something off about the dough and it's greasy as hell. i had more cheese on my pizza than veggies (and the taste of the veggies was weird -- like one of the vegetable toppings was starting to go bad). and tofu on this pizza? it's overkill and it's not doing anyone any favors and i'm sure it's gmo soy.  his hoagie was okay, summing up his sandwich as "giving me more than i need doesn't make it better." this sandwich was overflowing with meat.   i ate less than one slice and decided to box up the rest. as we were walking out, i dumped my leftovers. i've never ever thrown away almost a whole pizza. seriously -- how can you get it so wrong?  bad food. dirty glasses. apathetic service. the only redeeming quality? their beer draft selection.</u_review>
<b_review>great independent urban cafe with ultra friendly staff, great drinks, and decent munchables.  it's a good size so even when there are a bunch of people there you can still take up a spot at a table and get into your own little world - whether that be reading, laptop hacking, or whatever.  the downtown dash (free bus service) runs right in front of fair trade, and there is a stop right on central for the light rail too once that starts up, so it's damn easy to get to.  the one drawback is that they don't have tomatoes or onions or really any other accouterments for their sandwiches. . .which makes their "salads" just a bed of lettuce with your desired protein on top (basically the sandwich sans bread).  but whatever, i still love their curry chicken salad on multi grain bread.  and they have this coffee flavored jello that is really really good - they serve it in what i believe is a cappuccino mug with whipped cream on top.  mmmmm.  they also have recently started sushi and jazz nights on certain fridays (not all) from 6-9.  ok, obviously they don't offer an extensive amount of sushi, and it isn't stellar nor is it really that cheap, but the woman who makes it is just the sweetest person on earth.  and the jazz is more like a keyboardist schmoozing with his friends and every now and again playing a tune.  but hey, i just love the atmosphere here.</b_review>
<b_review>i'm a regular customer of fair trade and i usually have nothing but good to say about it. just ten minutes ago, though, i stood at te counter for about five minutes watching one employee talk on her phone. when the second employee came out from the kitchen she returned to a plate of food. i have no idea what impression they think that produces in customers, but i left without being served and i wonder if i should ever return. i have no interest in patronizing a coffee shop that doesn't have a sense of customer service. i will think very hard about going back, which is too bad considering the many days i've spent there.</b_review>
<b_review>great coffee. great atmosphere. very nice people. wonderful to get coffee somewhere other than a huge chain. long live a hometown shop!!!</b_review>
<b_review>i love this place, i just wish it was closer to me!  not only do they have almond milk, but they have gluten-free goodies. how awesome! they also offer sunday brunch menu, so count me in for eggs and potatoes with my latte! they have so many baked goods, enough to satisfy any appetite.  i would come in and work here, the furniture isn't the most comfortable i've been in, and plugs are hard to come by with some tables, but it's such a great atmosphere that i don't even care.   the staff is always so nice, what a great place to have a cup of coffee, a date, or a working session.  park in the parking garage, except it gets a little busy on sundays when the church parking is there too.</b_review>

<text>i have dropped zoe's down to one star because it was catered in to a work event that we had recently and i was forced to either eat it or starve.   fuck you zoe,  following me around town,  showing up at my work.... you're like a psycho stalker ex-boyfriend.  what's next?? a dozen red roses and some slaughtered animal remains??   bitch.</text>
<u_review>man... ok, i waited a couple of weeks to write this review update so as to not let my irritation surrounding our experience here cloud my judgment. turns out i'm still pissed off. i will do my best to remain impartial and separate said irritation from fact.     i will preface this by saying that i have always really enjoyed my experiences at sidebar. i would go as far to say that it's on very regular rotation due to location, atmosphere and price. we stop in at least a few times a month for drinks either before or after dinner and everyone that i've introduced to the place has been back on their own accord. i also know that the management and ownership genuinely care about their reputation in the community. that said, what happened here on saturday night a few weeks ago is unacceptable and if i may be honest, was not handled properly and needs to be addressed.   anyone that knows me knows i like to get my drink on. i get it...you're out with your friends, you have a dd for the night (though in this case, i doubt it) your having a good time, and bam....all of the sudden you realize "damn, i'm fucked up!" "i'm seeing two of everything" "i can barely stand up straight"   what do you do?? well, let me tell you what you don't do... you don't verbally assault the innocent person (that would be me) who happens to squeeze in at the bar next to your equally wt alcoholic boyfriend to order a dessert drink. yes, you caught me....i'm eye fucking your sloppy, hot mess of a man, he's just so irresistible.   after a few minutes of being slurringly cursed at and accused of i don't even know what, a female bartender came over and tried to calm this drunk bitch down by patting her on the arm and *shooshing* her and her boyfriend, who at this point had joined in. by her reaction to the couple i was under the impression that they were friends/acquaintances of the bartender or at the very least, regular customers. regular customers that had clearly been over-served, whether there or somewhere prior. regular customers that should not have beer/cocktails in front of them at this point. regular customers that should have been asked to leave or had a cab called for them....something.  i had to tell this girl to take her fucking hands off me twice. her face was an inch away from my face. i could smell her miserable life. there would not have been a third time.   the man i believe to be a manager (though i'm not sure, i see him frequently and he's a great guy) approached the couple as well and asked them to quiet down and apologized to us which i really appreciate, however these people couldn't even form coherent sentences. why are they still in your establishment? another thing that i must mention is that there has been a significant staff change. i'm all for maintaining a 'down town', edgy sensibility but there is a fine line between truly hip and try-hard hipster....the music on this particular evening was off the charts bad as well. the whole night. i mean, so bad it couldn't even be classified as 'ironically' bad. i dunno....maybe there was a full moon or something.  anyway, i really hope this was all a fluke and when we go back all will be restored with the universe. i like to go out and have a couple glasses of wine with my man, bar brawling is a little 1998 for me, but believe me when i say that when i ask you twice, you don't get a third chance. be nice.  peace and love - kristi</u_review>
<u_review>the slightly feminist/mostly old fashioned me feels torn in many directions upon writing this review. you see, i expect if not demand equal treatment in most instances however.... what i really like is to be wooed.  let me just start off by saying that society cleaners indeed "does it right" as thomas s. stated. i brought 7 basic button down long sleeved dress shirts and two pencil skirts in to be dry cleaned and everything came out beautifully.   my problem is this: when you advertise a special of $1.89 per shirt for anything over 3, you should put a little asterisk next to it stating that this is for men only.  that's right, my buttons are on the opposite side and my shirts are tiny compared to most men (which apparently requires hand pressing) but i'm not sure if that warrants a $4.00 per shirt difference. not only do i not feel wooed, i don't feel equal. my wallet would go as far to say it feels a little molested even.  maybe this is society's way of paying me back for all those free dinners (har de har har) i don't know but it's an annoyance that drops a five star rating to three. it's the year 2010 dry cleaning people... work on this please.</u_review>
<u_review>it gets the second star for "hormel turkey pepperoni".....  yes, the second star is because they happen to carry a product i can't live without....and no one else seems to carry.  the "security guard" is missing teeth and was doubtfully screened for background.  the place kinda smells like poo. everything is within about 4 days of it's pull date. they don't understand the importance of green bananas (or produce that isn't in the beginning stages of rot)  that said, i shop at safeway...... i hit basha's for pepperoni. that's all folks</u_review>
<u_review>hey you! , kid behind the bar! , all knowing beer douche!  you sir, are an asshole...  where do i begin.  i know it's difficult to take a review seriously when it starts off so, ahem, 'personal'  but please stay with me.  now, i admittedly know very little about beer. (i have a feeling that may have been the issue). there was a time when i knew very little about wine, or a high quality cut of meat, or turning over in my crib without assistance for that matter... but i digress.  that said, i happen to have a phd in douchebag.   it can take years and years of study (as in my case) to acquire such an extensive education. or, you can just pop into sleepy dog, have a two second conversation with the not so friendly beer god behind the counter, and earn your honorary.   a couple of questions:  why would you advertise something on sunday, that isn't available until tuesday.  ?  why would you be a snarky little prickface and act as though we're idiots for trying to order it.  ?  it's your advertising.  i was on a cloud before we came in here and you opened your mouth. thanks for making me get all bitchified.  i reallllly do not like you.  moving on, the space is cool. clean, bright and open; not what i was expecting. 1 star  dogma (with sound) on the tv. 1 star  cold tasty beer that i know nothing about. 1 star  my company. 5 stars.  fortunately i get to take him with me when i leave, so you don't get to keep any of those sleepy dog.   3 stars it is...</u_review>
<b_review>thanks to lindsay and zoe's for hosting a yelp event recently and allowing us to try out some healthy food for free! the location itself is small and orange and the food was good, not great. zoe's seems like a great stop for your lunch break and the prices are reasonable. the staff was friendly enough but overall this place isn't memorable. i wouldn't drive out of my way to visit it again but if i was nearby i would stop by for some spinach wraps with chicken and rice!</b_review>
<b_review>it's tempting to go to the mcdonald's right next to zoe's but i know my heart thanks me for the missed opportunities.  zoe's is great to grab a quick healthy lunch. a variety of sandwich options and hot plate options, you'll find something to like. my faves are the egg salad and grilled chicken hot plate. i'm more in love with the rice pilaf than anything else.  the food is not extraordinary. it's just what you expect grilled chicken, greek salad and sandwiches to taste like, except if you order anything with feta, ask for it with light feta. i have to scoop off the feta when i forget.   some say its pricey for lunch and i think its just about right. $8-$12 for lunch is about right. so if you're looking for a healthier alternative, check zoe's out some time and swing by mcdonald's for a soft-served ice cream cone at least.</b_review>
<b_review>charged us $15 for a small fast food. food wasn't good and based on the place and the quality, plates should be $6 not $15. that's what you would expect to pay for a really nice food and a nice restaurant in phoenix.</b_review>
<b_review>soooo, i stopped in to zoe's on a whim this afternoon. my ravished pregnant self was excited to see a grilled cheese with tomato sandwich on the the menu. one that also comes with chip and a side dish (i opted for the fruit salad.) for a reasonable $6.95. the limeade also looked yummy, so i got that, too. while i did have to drive about 20 minutes back to my office, i still believe that this meal would have stunk even if i sat down and ate it on the spot. the bread was burnt, the cheese was american - blech! (even though i see now, i get a choice of cheese instead of all the cheese listed, i wasn't asked.), and the fruit salad was all green apples. excuse me, one piece of pineapple. the only thing that saves this place from one star is the limeade. and even that could have been less sweet. skip this place. it isn't healthier for you, it's not local and it under delivered. :(</b_review>

<text>groupon ran a few specials to this place and i bought a few thinking $5 for a ticket and drink was a great deal...nope!  i love the dinner/movie theater concept, so i was excited when groupon ran their special and was looking forward to trying this place out. i love ipic and the new amc dinner theaters. but this place does it all wrong. horrible execution. horrible.  first of all, if you don't have "reserved" tickets, you need to show up at least an hour or two early to get a decent seat. shows are always sold out. theaters are too small and they block out 60% for "reserved" seating. should you find yourself with only the front row available with the rolling office chairs, (this has happened to me twice now), you can't upgrade your tickets to reserved seating at the box office. you have to purchase all new tickets through the kiosk or online for a $2 surcharge (a very annoying, anti-customer service move). a clever backhanded way of getting an extra $2 from the customers. that is bad business. by the way - the groupon tickets are not reserved seating.   when i complained to the manager, he said there was absolutely nothing he could do about the situation (really? nothing? what good are you as a manager if you have no power to remedy a customer's problem???). then he proceeded to condescendingly explain the whole "reserved" seating thing - yeah, i get it, i'm not an idiot. so i said i probably would not be returning because everything about the place was such a hassle. his response: that's fine if you don't come back.  rude. bad form.  i can't speak for the food because i didn't even get that far.  awful place. will not be returning.</text>
<u_review>this place draws a great crowd. it's totally casual with locals relaxing, laughing over good cold beers. super fun trivia night! sports playing on many large screens. it's a great time!   the decor is not my bag. and i wasn't a fan of the food. in fact, the pretzel was just so opposite of the menu description it was ironic and i laughed at it. i paid $6 for those frozen pretzels you get at costco and that generic nacho cheese. the burger was ok. veggies were fresh and it was cooked correctly but the bun was stale and dry. ick. seasoned fries were good.  now the highlight of our evening was the draft selection. very impressive. they have dogfishhead! yum!  service was pretty good too. our food came out really fast and our server answered our questions about the different types of brews, got us samples, and was very friendly.  gosh i wish the food was better here. i wouldn't mind coming back for happy hour or just to drink.</u_review>
<u_review>wow the coffee is superb, there's no doubt about that! i got an iced dirty chai with rice milk (they were out of almond milk. bummer). hubby got a cappuccino. excellent execution and flavor.  but i just don't feel comfortable here. service, while not rude, was not warm and definitely not friendly. i walked up to the counter and the guy basically stared at us. it was awkward.  i also feel like it's overpriced. my regular sized drink was $5.25!   we usually like to chat a bit with the baristas or owners about their coffee and what not, but we were just not digging the vibe of this place. maybe because we had our kids with us that we kind of got the cold shoulder? it's not like we were staying and hanging out. i don't know.   coffee 5 stars for sure. but customer service/atmosphere i give that 1-2 stars.</u_review>
<u_review>this review is more about the birthday party experience we had here. the park itself is one of our favorite parks and i take my kids all the time. there is a big playground, small splash pad, a lake where you can feed the ducks (my kiddos love that). it's beautiful.   we had my daughter's birthday party here and i think it's a good value. about $100 for unlimited ride bands for 9 kids and 2 adults. none of the adults wanted to ride rides so they just let 2 more kids use them. you also get a party host, ice cream, balloons, and you can bring in your own food (which saved us quite a bit of money).   that all being said, we were very disappointed that the train was not working for most of the party. the kids had to ride the carousel the whole time. they were still going to charge me full price until i complained, then they reluctantly offered me a 10% discount.   furthermore, the party host does not host. she helped put up the balloons and then sat there the whole time. i had to ask her to do everything - get the cake, put on ride bands, etc. i paid extra for the package with the party host so i wouldn't have to do those things. i thought she would be hosting the party and lead the kids through some sort of a schedule. when she gave me the comment survey to fill out, i told her what i was going to put on the form about her hosting and she got very defensive and said those things weren't in her job description so it wasn't her fault that i had those expectations of what a party host does. i wasn't going to argue with her but management really should clarify that they don't actually host, just help with set up and clean up.  overall, not 100% thrilled with the party experience here, but i will continue to take my kiddos as we very much enjoy the park itself.</u_review>
<u_review>slow as molasses and got my order wrong. i ordered one iced coffee with sugar-free vanilla. how do you mess that up? i was the only customer in the drive through and it wasn't busy inside. no excuse for the incompetence. after reading the other reviews, they just don't care here apparently.</u_review>
<b_review>the looks of the place is pretty cool they have music blaring outside as you walk up. i hate the line set up as if your waiting to check in to a hotel, plane, or waiting for a ride at an amusement park. the staff was totally friendly and attentive until we needed something like another drink or ketchup.   the desk seating w office chairs might be ok if you're a tall person but for a shorty like me or kids this won't work if you want to actually see a movie! being a parent here to see the muppets w the kid i noticed this problem immediately. its not a good view the desk part comes up too high. we had to opt for the theater seats they are big and roomy but you def lose closeness here. forget watching scary movies and hiding your face in your boyfriends shoulder. forget a make out session w your secret lover! no cuddling here either! heck you'll be lucky if you even get to hold hands through all this! if you are more than a party of 2 say goodbye to everyone else because they will be too far away to even see although they're just 2 seats away!   they claim you press the button and someone will be with you immediately and before the movie starts i totally agree. i really like how right before the movie started they prompt you to turn "off" your phones and if your child becomes disruptive to step out of the theater! how many movies have you sat through wishing someone would say that???   i was not shocked at the price of food, it is scottsdale after all. i ordered the margharita pizza, the man ordered cesar w grilled chicken, and the little had a cheeseburger meal. the beer was cheap i thought so why not some shiner bock on tap. our pints came back w no head idk about you but who doesn't like a little head?!?!?!   the food didn't take too long and wasn't so quick either which i didn't mind so much it made me tink they were cooking my food at least. the kid devoured her burger and fries so that got her approval but let's be honest kids will eat anything even mcdonald's! am i right??? my pizza came out piping hot and it was good to go in my belly. i would have liked a little more tomatoes and basil and a little less grease just my opinion. take it or leave it. the salads are ginormous keep this in mind and ask for extra extra dressing so you don't run out and have to sit there looking at your salad for 15 mins waiting for someone to bring you more! assuming your options for your salad are either fried or grilled chicken you may think you are getting some kind of hot meat on it. well it's not the grilled chicken was cold and while there was a lot of it looked like shredded chicken that's prob not so fresh if you catch my drift.   it is kind of annoying people walking back and forth the whole time and while there is more space between you and other people it still gets distracting. i'll blame my last issue on mercury being retro, when the check came and they doddled off the pen did not work. i scribbled for 5 mins and gave up. when the movie was over and we got back into light i realized my hands were covered in ink in fact i still have some 2 days later. i wouldn't go here for a good movie that you really need to get into. for family time it's ok i suggest eating at home and ordering some some popcorn, dessert, and drinks!</b_review>
<b_review>went again last night with two friends with the intention of catching the 8pm showing of the campaign.  (yep, had groupons to redeem again.)  unfortunately, most of the shows were sold out and we went with the first available one; the 8:30pm showing of premium rush.    the place is definitely more packed in the evening than in the morning/afternoon.  we got our tickets around 7:40 and hung around the bar until called to the waiting line for our show.  apparently there are three lines and staff will make an announcement when the line is open for your movie (usually 20-30mins before show time).  oh yeah - if you pay for reserved seating, you don't have to wait in line.  you'll be escorted by staff to your seat(s).    i noticed there are more staff in the evening and they were quite busy throughout the show.  we ordered three skinny coconut coladas ($9.50 each), the chopped salad ($12.25), the build your own starter, and three sodas (to use up the free drink tickets).    the coladas were good and strong enough.  the chopped salad and byo starter were decently sized, which was a nice surprise.  the dressing for the chopped salad was good and with the fresh ingredients, made each bite good (could have done with less blue cheese though).    for the byo starter (we get up to four items), we chose the coconut chicken tenders, spicy drummettes, burger bites, and smoked ribs.  you basically get a half order for each.  we got a decent portion - three dummettes, two burger bites, three smoked ribs, and four coconut tenders (also had a big side of ranch).  i was surprised at how tender the ribs were and how tasty everything was - definitely worth the $15.25.    i enjoyed both experiences at smc and will be going back.</b_review>
<b_review>studio movie grill opened up last friday, and while there is much potential for this movie theater, there are still a few kinks to work out.  our theater had fold down desk counters for only the right side of the chairs, so anyone sitting on the left side only had the metal underside to stabilize your food on rather than a wooden table.  in addition, service buttons weren't on all the tables, which made it hard to ask for service during the movie.    we had lunch before going here so we didn't feel like trying any of the food, but i did order a frozen hot chocolate for dessert/drink.  it was indulgent and delicious.  all the employees here were very nice and after the movie the manager greeted us and wanted to make sure we had a good experience.  i'll go here again to try out their food, and hopefully by then they will have gotten in the left sides of the table countertops!</b_review>
<b_review>this theater is cute and i like the open concept of it but i just wasn't very comfortable here good thing we picked a good, funny movie to watch or else i don't know how else i would be comfortable enough to stay upon walking in, the smg looked like a cute modern movie theater the employees are all very nice, young, and clean there is a full bar to your left when you walk in and when we were there, it didn't seem busy or packed which is probably the norm for this location we used a groupon ticket and so the movie was pretty cheap when we walked into the theater i noticed that is was a little dated and really wide i love the whole dining/drinking/movie watching experience but these are some of the things i didn't like about this theater 1) seating is spaced well but it seems like the people who sit in the chairs in front of you would be in your way 2) roller ball chairs in a theater would be loud and annoying 3) although it is a dine-in theater, i hate hearing the sound of rustling paper and silverware clinking 4) the chairs are hard to get comfortable and i was really hoping they would recline 5)the screen volume can get a bit loud sometimes, louder than normal/usual  all in all this isn't a bad theater but it was just one that didn't really do it for me i did enjoy the movie and popcorn enough  next review could be better if i get the big blue margarita first :)</b_review>

<text>i had lunch here with rand h ,norm r and robyn n a small uye. this was my first trip to scotts generations and i found it to be an authentic jewish deli. i had a bowl (more like a pot) of kreplach soup and a corned beef sandwich that came with pickle spears and coleslaw. the lunch was very good and the soup was amazing. i would and will return to scotts.</text>
<u_review>had the all you can eat pizza lunch here with rand h. and robyn n.  to start with you also get a salad (garden or caesar)  soft drink or iced tea and garlic bread. the service here was top notch and they were always there to make sure you got enough. the pizza was really good and i got to try 5 different kinds.the place is like a fancy sports bar inside with great classic rock music playing.so a solid 4 stars for this place.</u_review>
<u_review>well my trip to this golden corral was well worth the trip.ilove golden corral and this is probably my favorite one.they had my favorite dishes from there amazing pot roast to the molten lava cake. a few new items were the homemade potato chips were bbq and they also had some breaded chicken livers that were very good and that is something you dont see at any buffet.they also have a cream of potato and bacon soup that is very taste.as far as all the one and two star reviews go i cant figure out the problem these people have..do they not like lots of good food with plenty of choices. well i hope my review boosts there rating because i love golden corral and i hate to see them get negative reviews because i dont think they deserve them.</u_review>
<u_review>had lunch here with robyn n. and rand h. for a fast food burger it was ok but i like a home burger much better. even most bar burgers have more flavor.the french fries are good fresh cut fries and the toppings are added by you. if the fries had been not fresh and the topping bar weak which it was not i would have given them two stars.</u_review>
<u_review>had lunch here today with rand h and robyn n. i had the the hot dog with pulled pork on it and baked potato fries and both of these were awesome. rand h. gave me one of his onion rings and it was probably the best onion ring i have ever tasted.after are great lunch i stopped at the coffee shop and grabbed a berry scone and some type of orange chocolate filled cookie and both of those were great as well. so with nothing i could say negative about the place i give them 5 stars and hope to return soon.</u_review>
<b_review>omg the best reuben in phoenix hands down!! owner is very attentive and it's family owned. great authentic deli, love it!!</b_review>
<b_review>bottom line: scott's has a matzo ball soup so good i can't imagine how anyone could ever hate the jews. best bagels in phoenix, hands down. take your einstein's and shove it. scott's has an expansive menu that ranges across breakfast, traditional deli offerings, and a strong but semi random assortment of 'home cooking' type meals that your mom makes but you never see in restaurants. i haven't spent a lot of time in delis in new york, but scott's reminds me of the "new york deli" i used to live around the corner from in houston, down the street from the jcc - tasty, simple, and unapologetic, about anything. i love their soups, although their pastrami is not the best i've ever had. they have every flavor of dr brown's imaginable. the portions are huge - too huge, actually. i'm minuscule, so the prospect of a sandwich that is 3x what i can eat in one sitting is daunting to the point that i only go if i know i can take a box home. the service runs hot and cold, but i've never not gotten what i wanted the way i wanted it, and if the waitress isn't looking at me with vague disapproval, i feel like it's not an authentic new york experience.</b_review>
<b_review>been here enough including several times since i started reviewing on yelp but have held back...today, i'm busting it out.  i have a lifetime of eating in various jewish deli's in chicago, florida and arizona and scott's is typical, not exceptional but certainly a restaurant where food is decent, portions are excessive and pricing is never a bargain.  so i have no particular gripes and i would recommend the place to others who are looking for good chicken noodle/matzah ball soup or a massive corned beef or pastrami sandwich. for this you cannot go wrong here.</b_review>
<b_review>i paid $26 dollars for two bagel sandwhiches with lox and the works.  highway robbery.  they are good, don't get me wrong.  but this is outrageous.  at the most i can see maybe $7 or even $8 but my god....  well it was delicious but i could easily just go to einstein bagels or all the rest and be just as happy, especially happy for my wallet, it smarts right now.</b_review>

<text>when an avid cook tried to tell me about penzey's, i wrote it off as the mary kay of spices... until a year later, she took me.  i've been hooked since.. the pricing is much better than the mccormicks in the grocery stores though not as good as bulk from leelee's or an ethnic middle eastern market for example.  i keep going back, b/c i've gone ocd building penzey bottles and bags collection.  i've justified the bulk bag purchases by buying their mini empty jars and creating spice gift baskets for house warmings and birthdays... it's a sick and wonderful obession.  my faves: smoked paprika -- buy this now, buy in bulk. sunny paris -- great on eggs and also baked sweet potato fries (doused w/ olive oil and smoked paprika) shallot salt -- ok i just sniff it, i can't really taste the shallot ginger -- for holiday baking fennel -- i've never seen seeds this green elsewhere</text>
<u_review>this place has been here for years... my first time was at least in 2000.  1/4 grilled beef + extra flour tortilla is less than $6.    i find the chicken dry and sometimes the steak might be over cooked... immediately move those slices into the salsa fresca and let them marinate, as you build your tortilla like tacos one by one.  so good!</u_review>
<u_review>before i board a plane, my go-to place to pickup the latest magazines for cheap to leave on the flight for the next bored customer.</u_review>
<u_review>it is just dismal those few times you want something to eat at the coffee house, and your choices are sad breakfast offerings or overpriced bakery items.  but i am vouching for steve's food!... bacon, jalepeno & cheese frittata (w/ thin sliced potatoes as the bottom layer) as well as the ham & cheese stuffed brioche!  you do have to heat yourself.. luckily the microwave does have power settings, so go pl-7 or 8 to avoid overcooking as you heat.    these guys are open early (5:30am m-f and 6:30am s-s)... so this is going to be my new go to place to grab some food when i have an early morning  flight or roadtrip.</u_review>
<u_review>this place is popular w/ the overseas chinese (and especially) of the college student variety... probably cuz the pricing is dirt cheap and gives them a bit of home.  it's a choice for chinese food considering the plethora of vietnamese offerings at the mekong place across the street.  service was slow on this full friday night and did see a couple walk out, but the staff is super uber duper friendly (owner waitress to the young guy waiter).  hk milk tea -- better than most, i like mine cold.  yellow leek bean sprout fish -- almost all sprout over leek, tasty but extremely oily.  could of cut that down by half at least, was trying to drain the oil out.  spicy pork noodle (on the wall pic) -- sweet and not very spicy, you'd like it if you're a fan of thick round white noodle dishes.  salted fish, chicken & tofu pot --  best of the bunch.  preserved salted fish is used sparingly to flavor the remaining ingredients.</u_review>
<b_review>spice heaven!!!  if you love to cook, bake, grill- whatever, you will absolutely die when you walk in this place! they have every single spice you can imagine (over 40 types of cinnamon for example... who knew that was possible?!?). they have a variety of specialty spices in rare raw and pure form, as well as blended spices and seasonings for different forms of cooking.   one of my favorite purchases is the vanilla bean sugar. it's just pure white sugar with fresh vanilla bean mixed it- i love to sprinkle a little in my morning oatmeal! delish!   if you're stuck on what to buy mom for mother's day, or maybe a bridal shower gift- pick up one of their pre-made gift baskets or customize one to suite that person's kitchen hot buttons!   this place is a must visit- you will definitely not walk out empty handed!</b_review>
<b_review>there's nothing i can say about penzey's that hasn't been said before. if you love to cook and are looking for inspiration, this place will always manage to give you new ideas. having relocated to phoenix from san francisco, i was ecstatic to find a penzey's nearby (less than 10 minutes away as opposed to the 30 minutes i used to travel). this penzey's is located in tempe marketplace near a mattress store and a health store, across the parking lot from jc penney's. like other penzey's, you can smell the spices and read the label of the sample jar to get ideas on how to use the spice you're looking at. the people working at the store are really friendly and returns/exchanges are easy (at least in my experience). finally, the customers are phenomenal. during my first trip to this store, i met this really nice lady who gifted me with a jar of shallot pepper! you gotta love it when the customers are equally as awesome as the store itself:)</b_review>
<b_review>i love penzey's spices! i first discovered them in the late 1990s, when i moved to a small town in nc where the spices were black pepper and catsup. they saved us from culinary disaster becasue we could order their products in the mail!  when we moved to tempe, i would purposely arrange a whole afternoon to drive up to their scottsdale store to get everything i needed. now, they are much closer to our home, and i love popping in for smaller spice requirements.  i love that they have hard to find spices, i love that they have great prices and you can buy large portions for small cost, yet the spices are still fresh and delicious. i recommend penzeys to everyone!</b_review>
<b_review>my husband and i were given a collection of penzey's spices as a wedding gift years ago, and it was one of the best gifts we received.  little did i know, we would be moving to scottsdale a few years later and would find a store in our backyard!  if you like to cook, you will find every spice, seasoning mix, and dried herb imaginable.  if you don't like to cook, you will still find every spice, seasoning mix, and herb imaginable and you will want to start cooking, or at least start a beautiful "collection" of their products.  i love their products are generally available in a smaller "i only need a little" size as well as standard size spice jars, and some in larger bags for refilling.  empty jars are available, too!  on my last visit, i found hot cocoa mix, and with winter just around the corner...okay the corner has a wide berth.  maybe frozen hot chocolate is in order!  the only problem with penzey's is i calculate it's going to cost me about $40,000 to build a suitable kitchen to house their products.  it's worth it.</b_review>

<text>"excuse me waiter. what's this fly doing in my soup?"  "it appears to be doing the backstroke sir."   yep. this pretty much sums up our service at mb this past sunday. forgotten entrees. no ice bucket for the champagne. drinks took forever, if indeed, they were remembered. ketchup? our beniets? ugh!   formerly the foodbar (remember that place, with the awful layout and crazy ordering procedure?), mb is a lovely french restaurant in the heart of oldtown. we sat inside, luckily, as some gen x jewel type performer was on the patio "singing" and strumming her guitar. i heard just a few bars and wanted to stab my eye out with a hot fork. fortunately the hustle and bustle inside perfectly drowned it out!   the food was quite good. not incredible. beniets were undercooked a bit, but hey, we scarfed them down anyway. my eggs benedict was fantastic; served with biscuits instead of english muffins. but no potatoes. no salad. no nothing on the side. not even a garnish. others seemed pleased with a burger, granola and an all american breakfast.   christine is right however, in that we were there to celebrate a birthday. too bad much of our energy was used to flag down anyone who could help us. i swear i almost asked the lady sitting next to us to refill rickie's coffee. god that would have been fun!   so i can't say oui oui to mb quite yet. and for now i shall just say ta ta!</text>
<u_review>park central deli. not to be confused with central park deli on the upper westside. there a few similarites. believe me nancy.  on the poz side for pcd clean! super, mega clean. very impressed. i could see my reflection in the shiny floors. and i almost ran into a busboy while admiring myself, but dayum, them was some clean tiles! friendly and helpful! yes, the sandwich experts behind the counter were most polite and efficient.  on the negativo side for pcd well. the sandwich. ugh. and that's why i"m there. rye was dry. pastrami was, um, well, what the hell ryhmes with pastrami. um, oh, i know....pastrami was no a yummy...ok. i'm trying people. and the slaw. you know what i'm gonna say. the slaw...drum roll please.... was blah! as in bland. not sweet. not sour. ugh. on the poz side for cpd.... well it's in new york baby! what else do you need?  there's a surprisingly fabulous, modern patio at pcd. seriously worth checking out for a "mall" establishment. i'll go back. perhaps to try another deli delight. or maybe to hurl my sandwich in the koi pond. even though the sign says not to feed the fish. ha! i'm de elited and a rebel biatches!!!!!  and maybe, just maybe, i'll wear my i heart ny t shirt.</u_review>
<u_review>thankfully they're still closed.   that's it.  that's my update.  drink folgers. drink sanka. drink malted battery acid. just know you're lucky you didn't drink the "coffee" here!</u_review>
<u_review>cpk. creative. pizzas. kinda. when i think of the early 90s. i think of cpk. of course i also think of joey lawrence on blossom. but who doesn't, really? and new coke. and we all know how that worked out. but cpk was innovative at the time. california cooking was all the rage thanks to mr. puck. the bbq chicken pizza won over droves of pizza fans. quickly, the thai pizza caught on and cpk became quickly initialized in american culture like kfc, pta and fyi. this location serves up the fare like all the others. not much panache but dependable. much like the chevrolet malibu. could they use a bit of a makeover? sure. but the price is right set got one and no one's loving that. so why bother.</u_review>
<u_review>my ode to estelle getty: picture this. scottsdale. hotel indigo pool.  a middle aged gay man holding a glass of new zealand sauvignon blanc runs to make a photo opp at rickie's fashion show. he didn't realize the three svelt female models with air bags for breasts were nude. naked. sin ropa! nada lotta! except for their bikini-painted bodies. yes. body paint.  by the pool. me. them. slippery floor. slippery glass of wine.  as the photo is being snapped, i find myself losing my balance and i think, as i was going down with the wine, i should grab on to someone's clothing. to brace my fall. in front of hundreds.  well. they're nude. there is nothing to grab onto. me and the wine go down spilling wine on all three of the models. causing their body paint to start streaking! snap goes the photo.  oh. hotel indigo? the services? valet guy parked my car. hostess greeted me. bartender overserved me. the models hated me.  good times...</u_review>
<b_review>i slept in today and worked up an appetite doing some shopping and socializing at the old town farmers market.  it was after 12 noon when i realized i was starving since i hadn't eaten breakfast.  (i realize this may be normal for some, but this is rare for me - i eat breakfast every day!)  jared and i wanted to stay in the area and we finally agreed to head over to metro.  we had minnie with us, so we planned on sitting outside.  unfortunately, despite having a patio, metro does not allow dogs.    we ended up having minnie sit right outside the barrier to the patio while we sat at the table right inside the barrier and we took turns going out to keep her company.  needless to say, this was not the most relaxing brunch, but we were starving and didn't want to head elsewhere!  jared had the oatmeal and i had the egg white omelette with cheese grits and wheat toast.  i'm still a fan of the breakfast/brunch at metro more than lunch or dinner... the service was alright; not overly friendly... and it must've been bill's day off because we didn't see him either.  bummer!  bottom line: metro is a great spot for breakfast in my opinion... but unfortunately, they are not dog-friendly!</b_review>
<b_review>go! go quickly! we went last night for yelp easts and everything practically is on the yelps eats menu.   my husband and i both started out with the onion tart, my friend had the escargot and her husband had the pate. the tart was fabulous and huge (perfect size for a light lunch). the escargot were a bit of a disappointment. nothing bad but not as good as she hoped. the pate appetizer came as two slices rather than just one, a very generous portion. we all tried it and it was good (and it's made in-house).   for our entree my friend and i each ordered the scallops, my husband ordered the duck and my friend's husband got the steak frites. the scallops were phenomenal. they came on a bed of house made organic creamed corn. delicious to the last bite. my husband loved his duck. it was pounded thin and panko crusted and served on a bed of horseradish spaetzle. granted, he loves anything panko crusted, but he did say the duck was good. i had a bite, but the panko crust turned me off (i dislike anything panko crusted). the steak frites was a huge portion and so delicious and bloody.   for dessert we each ordered something different. i had the macaroon, my husband got the blueberry tart, my friend ordered the beignets and her husband ordered the sticky toffee pudding. everyone thoroughly enjoyed their desserts. mine (the macaroons) came layered with two different kinds of mousses - dark chocolate and maybe caramel. it got a little too sweet towards the end, but it's dessert. par for the course. the beignets came a huge pile of them with three sauces (one of them nutella!).   i will definitely come back here again and i'd like to try breakfast here too. the food was great and the atmosphere near perfect (they need to ditch the tvs - they really don't belong there). our next yelp eats meal at digestif has a lot to measure up to now.</b_review>
<b_review>had breakfast here with my honey on the way to the airport to go back home to cali.   the restaurant was very clean and the decor was contemporary.  we were immediately seated and given menus and a glass of water. i immediately noticed the menu consisted of a fusion of french and southern foods.   i ordered an egg white omelet, it came with potatoes, and toast. i also had a mimosa.   my husband ordered the quiche lorraine which came with a salad. he also ordered a bloody mary.   we also ordered beignets (we couldn't resist) which came with raspberry sauce, nutella, and a vanilla bean sauce.   the food as great and cheap! the raspberry sauce was good enough to write home and tell mom.   the beignets was not as good as the ones you get from the famous cafe du mond in new orleans but they were very tasty.   i wish we would have discovered this place sooner.</b_review>
<b_review>had brunch here on a weekend morning. we weren't sure where we wanted to go and just spontaneously picked this place. i was definitely not disappointed in the food. the service, however, wasn't great. there were 2 hostesses and both seemed to lack some communication. once we were seated, it was better.  we both had the omelette which was perfectly cooked. the potatoes were delicious and well-seasoned. the stars of the meal were the beignets. along with the trio of sauces they came with (nutella, vanilla bean and raspberry), they were absolutely phenominal. i would go back again and again and again for those things.</b_review>

<text>what the hell?? we're regulars no more after our last visit.  thoroughly ignored by the wait staff and nary an apology.  we will not go back!</text>
<u_review>i had a work meeting here and it's exactly the type of  average, mediocre, corporate food/bar/entertainment place i don't like. it was packed. enough said.</u_review>
<u_review>we went back for a stayover for the wife's birthday.  food was good not great except the seafood tower which is a great value.  the service was slow and not great.  the comp'd desserts were pretty uninspired - but free.  they should really tell you you cant use the food and beverage credit from the hotel in there.   blt and mastro's are much better.</u_review>
<u_review>yes, the place is old and stale looking but every-time i'm there i feel  like being in a small town diner with all the folks that i know.  the coffee isn't very good but the food is tasty and not greasy.  the prices are low and the serrano's are as local as locals can get. it gets crowded on weekends so come before 10.</u_review>
<u_review>my new sunday happy hour hangout spot after the cards lose in glendale.  the cocktails are spot on and allow me drown my sorrows for a few hours before trekking back home.  i love the fig flatbread with a spiked lemonade.</u_review>
<b_review>we loved it! spicy, hot, flavourful and the "side dishes" are quite a treat. this is one of our favorite lunch spots with the folks from work. the prices are low, the people are very friendly, and the food is great!  what more could you ask for?  and when we go for lunch it is never a problem to get back to work on time, the service is so quick. you just have to remember that if you need a server they will not just be strolling by, you need to press the call button located on the wall by each table, then they are right there.  they are not open on tuesdays, don't know why</b_review>
<b_review>just moved to az not too long ago and was craving some korean food.  decided to try this place out since it had the best yelp ratings.  in the few months that i have been in the area, i have learned that phoenix generally does not have very good asian food, especially when compared to california or las vegas even.  with the lowered expectation in mind, this place wasn't half bad, but obviously not the best in the world.  the interior decoration of this restaurant was nice.  very clean and traditional to a typical korean shop.  don't let the exterior, and random location, psych you out.  it'll feel much more homey once you step foot inside their facility.  the service was great as long as the place doesn't get too busy.  we got there a little early and the waiters were great to us in the beginning, but as soon as the tables started filling up, they stopped checking in on us so it took a little longer than we would have liked to get our waters refilled and to pay for the meal.  if you time your trips right, this shouldn't really be a problem at all.  the food was good enough to satisfy a craving, but i definitely miss korean food from home.  the dishes here seem kind of generic.  it felt as if they just cut up some ingredients and threw it in pre-packaged store-bought seasoning and called it a day.  definitely did not feel like a meal that the chef poured his/her heart into preparing for the guests.  as such, you would expect the pricing to be a little more reasonable than what they're charging.  $16 for so-so bubulgi.. come on!  i do give them props for the individualized clay pot rice bowls though.  not too many places serve white rice that way, and i love fresh crunchy rice! :-d  in conclusion, would try this place again some day, but probably after i try some other places for comparison's sake.  if this place truly is the best of phoenix, then i wouldn't mind making additional trips out here to satisfy my random korean food cravings from time to time. :-)</b_review>
<b_review>chodang is probably the best korean restaurant in southern phoenix. it is clean and food is delicious. however, i think the price is bit high. i guess may be it is because of the free cold dishes they offer?</b_review>
<b_review>pretty good place.. decided to come here a couple months ago after reading reviews from yelp for a long time now..  tofu soups are yummy.. galbi ribs were also pretty good.. kimchee was average.. jap chae was very well portioned.. overall a great experience..  a little pricey for lunch.. but i think al korean restaurants are overpriced.. guess that's my chinese side.. lol, will def be back?? love the music!</b_review>

<text>i went for dinner on friday night and remembered how much i love this place. the staff recognizes us and is really friendly and accommodating. the inside has been cleaned up a lot recently even though the shopping plaza itself is a little run down.  my faves are the spring rolls and bun. i tried the family style lemon grass chicken this time and it was fantastic! just spicy enough to give it a nice flavor, but not so much that you burn your tastebuds off.</text>
<u_review>i went again today, and got the avocado rolls. nothing special... the green tea smelled like feet and was cold. i'm sorry ra, i know you hang out the cool kids, but if i want sushi i'm going to find someplace a little less mediocre.</u_review>
<u_review>not the classiest joint in town, but good deals to be found.  yes, it's true that the mills mall is certainly not as upscale some other malls in town. we get that, but i think some of the other reviews were actually a bit harsh on the clientele. not everyone can afford to shop at the biltmore or snottsdale fashion square. there's this little thing called a recession going on. heard of it? mills mall is full or everyday working folks who are looking for a good deal.   the mall spaces that used to sit empty and alone have been filled by new merchants. virgin megastore was filled by fye music, and the mall is slowly coming back to life. i started holiday shopping last night and every store i visited was having great sales and i walked away with nice quality gifts for a fraction of the price that i would pay at another mall.  gotta say, the bathrooms were pretty dirty, but otherwise this place has cleaned up immensely. the stores were clean and bright, floors were polished, and stores were neat and orderly.   my daughter loved riding on the old-fashioned carousel ride for $2 or a free trip to see santa. if you haven't been to the mills in a while, i say give it another chance this holiday season. or at least lower your standards a little if you're looking for a fashion square experience.</u_review>
<u_review>**review is for "the falls" pool area only**  i've been here twice now and it makes for a relaxing getaway from the ordinary. some friends rented a cabana ($80 for the day) which includes a tv, table and chairs, mini fridge, several chaise loungers, and lots of shade with a ceiling fan.   the pool was fabulous and the kids love it (the place was packed with kids on the lower section). they had music going and organized activities for the older kids - the water slide looked like fun although i didn't try it out myself in fear of atomic wedgies and my bikini top falling off. maybe next time...  this place only gets 3 stars though since i wasn't at all impressed with the service. you put up your little flag on the chair to request a server and it can be a half hour by the time they get back with your beer. and they automatically tack 20% gratuity on to the bill even if the service sucks. don't even get me started on how crappy the nacho's were...good thing i snuck in some of my own snacks so i didn't die of starvation between waitress visits.  make sure you request a cabana that the sun doesn't shine straight in the front though...the first time i thought i had heat stroke it was so hot...kind of like a brick oven.</u_review>
<u_review>went for the free "movies in the park free family movie series" last night and really enjoyed myself. the park has a giant inflatable movie screen where they show family movies every friday night at 7 in the early spring months.   get there early to get a spot closer to the screen and bring a picnic blanket to relax on. it got a little chilly later in the evening, i would bring a blanket to snuggle under too.</u_review>
<b_review>is this the best vietnamese food i've ever had? no, but for the price it's pretty decent without having to drive all the way to chandler. two bowls of pho and two orders of goi cuon for $15-16 is a steal. very homely taste to the broth and finally a place where goi cuon is inexpensive (it's $2.50 for two pieces). the vietnamese music in the background and the decent amount of vietnamese people dining inside add to the authenticity of the place.   but beware of the shady area it's in. located in a tiny strip mall in a not so great area of phoenix, i would not feel comfortable driving a really nice car here. or if you had to because it's your only form of transportation, then i'd recommend parking it in front of the restaurant where you can at least keep an eye on it through the windows while you're eating. probably not the cleanest restaurant either but i'll keep coming back until i find a reason to not to lol.    when i have a craving for vietnamese food i'll be back to have my fill until i can make it back home and eat some good food in san jose.</b_review>
<b_review>talk about authentic, this is a place i would be excited to take a vietnamese foreign exchange student, not because i want to impress them, but so they can translate the menu and get the waiter to bring me another $2.50 beer.  i will say, i was a little disappointed that there were no vegetarian pho options, but i don't think authentic pho is vegetarian, so until i learn to say "can i get this without beef" in vietnamese, i don't deserve it. i will stick with the few veggie options provided, which are delicious, ridiculously cheap, and easily enough for two meals.</b_review>
<b_review>very great prices for what you get! we got the bbq chicken sandwich, spring rolls, fried rolls, and a beef & brisket soup. we wish they had peanut sauce for the spring rolls. also, the soup didn't have as many veggies as the menu seemed to say it had.   we will for sure be back though!</b_review>
<b_review>i love this place. this was the first place i ever had pho, back in 1998. this place is always busy now. the prices are so cheap that it always keeps me coming back. the food is great and i always get their spring rolls.   i eat here about 2 times a week. the service here is not that great but the food makes up for it. i do have to say that since i come here so much the staff that is always there seems to know me and our order now. service gets better when your a regular i guess.  voted best spring rolls in phoenix magazine.</b_review>

<text>i've been to kona a few times but have learned the best time to go is happy hour. the place is lively and the drinks are awesome! i would definitely recommend the chambord margarita. it is one of the best margaritas i have ever had!! and, for $4, it's pretty inexpensive. i also enjoy their sushi and appetizers.   kona is a nice place to go for drinks and a meal. i would recommend it.</text>
<u_review>being on the property of secret garden is wonderful with the trees, beautiful garden and calm fountains. the house is quaint and i loved the feel of walking on wood floors, small rooms and actually feeling like you are in a old, beautiful home. i came here with a big party (11 of us total) and we had a nice table in front of a fireplace and christmas tree. the happy hour menu was pretty limited but decided on the essence riesling ($6). wine was crisp and tasted good. for dinner, i ordered an artisan cheese board (to share) and the grilled romaine salad. the cheese board was nice, came with 3 cheeses for hh, grilled bread, raisins, nuts and i believe figs. the grilled romaine salad was not my thing at all...i don't know if it was the vinagrette or the stuff inside the lettuce but something just didn't work for me. i didn't eat it all and left hungry. i did also sample the polenta fries but again, not my thing. they were mushy and the only thing that gave it some flavor was the sauce it came with. i wanted to try things i wouldn't normally try but i think next time, i'll stick to something simple (i keep hearing their burger is good).   i did love the atmosphere, the company, the service. i didn't like the price tag. at happy hour, i walked away with a $33 bill for a glass of wine, cheese board and a salad. their patio also looked really nice, especially at night with the trees lit up and the barn playing music. overall, i think i would come back here because it really is a beautiful spot and the service was amazing!</u_review>
<u_review>after seeing all the 2nd pasta helping commercials on tv, my boyfriend and i decided to have italian for date night. we were seated promptly upon arrival but noticed an odd smell coming from the dining room. the wood burning grill was close to where we were seated but it smelled off. our server was slow to arrive for drink orders and my boyfriend kept having to drink my water because our server neglected to fill water. i ordered a glass a wine, which of course was delicious. bread came and was honestly the best thing we ate all night. i loved the olive oil and spice mixture! i ordered the pasta carraba and a caesar salad. the salad was really over-dressed and the dressing had quite a peppery kick. i like pepper but not overpowering. for the 2nd pasta helping, there were only 3 options and none of them resembled the pasta on the commercial. the pasta i ordered was very disappointing, very mushy. the chicken was grilled nicely but for $15.50, the pasta wasn't prepared better than what i could have made at home for a lot cheaper. we skipped dessert and took my leftover pasta home. i did like that we were given bread, olive oil and spice mixture (since that was delicious). it has been a while since i had visited carraba's and now i know why. everything was mediocre and for me, i don't like visiting places that are just ok.</u_review>
<u_review>i recently moved to the area and have been on the hunt for a good bagel shop/bakery. i have been here twice now and haven't been impressed either time. the first time i went inside, which was nice. i ordered the cinnamon bagel with honey walnut cream cheese. i must say, that cream cheese is divine!! the blueberry muffin was a joke...really greasy and not tasty. i came here again for breakfast and went to the drive thru, which was really fast and efficient. i just kept it simple with a plain bagel and plain cream cheese and didn't have any complaints. all in all, this place is ok but nothing special. i really wish they had more bakery items to choose from since their restaurant has the word "bakery" in it.</u_review>
<u_review>we came in towards closing one night and were greeted with friendly smiles and conversation from mike (the owner). we told him it was our first time in and he was more than happy to go through the menu with us and proceeded to tell us his restaurant is known for their cheesesteaks. the rumble in my stomach and the smells of meat cooking got me to order one immediately with peppers, onions, mushrooms and cheese. we were told it would be about a 10 minute wait and were given complimentary fountain drinks in the meantime. we were also told the restaurant is getting painted and having some minor renovations to look less like an ice cream shop (ie: checkered floors, ice cream pictures posted, etc.). place is cute with toys and candies for kids and a coke machine with glass bottles.   when our food arrived, the cheesesteaks were huge and overflowing with meats and toppings! the bread is heavenly mixed with the tender meat, veggies and melting cheese, wow! i was super hungry and could barely finish the cheesesteak! this is definitely the right place to go if you are hungry and in need of good food!  oh, and i did get some ice cream to go (chocolate brownie) and that was also good. i could have done without the walnuts though.  will be back and lucky for me it's so close to home!</u_review>
<b_review>located on "happy hour row" in scottsdale fashion square by the yardhouse and z'tejas, kona falls into the category of scenester joint with a plus size happy hour.  there isn't much to whine about with the happy hour, except that maybe the discounts apply to inflated prices. so does that mean they're not ripping me off for those three hours? ok, i guess.   food is good, not amazing. overall, not bad, if you can get a seat and ignore the smell of cheezy bachelors on the prowl.</b_review>
<b_review>i think this is a fantastic stop for happy hour appetizers, sushi, and casual drinks.   everything was very tasty and portioned well enough to share!   you can sit outside and the service was friendly and attentive.  i really enjoyed myself here.</b_review>
<b_review>sure it's a chain, but kona grill is a step above the rest, imho.  i always start with the tuna wasabi appetizer.  their fried rice is just awesome, some of the best i've had.  this appetizer combines sushi (sort of) and fried rice.  i could stop there...it's so yummy.  i've had their pizza, sushi, and desserts as well and i can't say i'm ever disappointed.    if you are looking for an authentic sushi experience, you won't find it here.  most of the sushi is pretty mainstream.  but it you want to get a great meal and look at a ton of hotties, you can't beat it.  go for happy hour!  most cost effective and pretty generous.</b_review>
<b_review>one of the more bizarre phenomenons i have seen... why is the place to be after work in scottsdale a restaurant in a mall "basement"?  is it the choice view of the parking garage entrance?  the gentle breeze laden with the scent of car exhaust ?  i swear, it's true.  flocks of shiny happy people packed like sardines onto the postage stamp sized patio.  maybe it's the proximity to the valet station, patio viewers can quickly size up the, errrr, "qualifications" of would be suitors?  i just don't know.  on a more serious note, the food is pretty good.  the drinks are pretty good.  the restaurant itself is modern and stylish.  i would definitely (and have) popped into the restaurant after a day of shopping for a bite to eat.</b_review>

<text>we love angel sweet. here's why:  1. there's always plenty of parking. 2. the kids working there are nice. 3. they have the best peanut butter gelato i have ever eaten.  4. they don't limit you to the number of flavors you can get in a size, like some other places do.  so go ahead, try that super dark with the peanut butter and the cheesecake and fall in love with angel sweet. just be prepared to sit on the hard bench outside or take it to go--they have only three or four tables inside.</text>
<u_review>first, you have to know that this place is casual. wear your flip flops, hat on backward, and your asu t-shirt, and you'll be fine. lots of tvs, pretty busy on game nights, and there's a patio.  the best part? kids were sat on the restaurant side. woohoo!  as for the food, just embrace the whole peanuts on the floor thing. really. it was hard for me to chuck them on the floor, too, but it's not really a reason to dock a star... the food and service will take care of that for you, because it's as casual as the atmosphere.   the service was just a bit slow and sloppy. hubby was given the wrong sandwich,so i shared half of my turkey ruben with him. it was a fine sandwich--not great, but not bad. hence the 3 stars! his cheesesteak came back out looked really yummy but the cheese sauce just didn't have any flavor. my blue moons were excellent. :)  so if you want a fun, casual night out, just don't go with high expectations and i think you'll be just fine!</u_review>
<u_review>as the others have mentioned, the decor and service are a bit lacking, we have to agree. the nanny was on tv when we ate here last friday night. at 7:30pm we were the only table. we counted no fewer than 7 employees (including children who helped serve us).  i started with a ginger beer. i didn't know what it was before i ordered, but it was so strong i couldn't drink it. the (head?) waitress later asked if it was too strong and i said yes. she brought a to-go cup and told me to put half ginger beer and half water together at home.  i had the goat curry. it was amazing. super tender and flavorful; just watch for the tiny bones. the oxtail was sold out. hubby had the jerk chicken which was moist with a bit of a kick.   sides were rice, a warm cabbage slaw, and plantains. overall, we thought the food was excellent for the price, but it's really not a great date place.</u_review>
<u_review>went early during first friday last week and scored a spot at the bar. thank god for that, because this place was tiny, and i wouldn't recommend it for groups.  having said that, we ordered whatever the bartender suggested (4 different drinks in all), and found them all to be outstanding. we would've liked to try some of their rums, but there was no help offered figuring out how to sample those--it's a bit overwhelming!  the nice thing is that you can order food from the adjoining restaurant. however, the jerk spice on the perfectly cooked scallops was so spicy that i could not eat it.</u_review>
<u_review>we've been to tuck shop a couple of times. we recommend a reservation for peak weekend hours since the place is tiny. we've had the same slightly snotty, disinterested waiter both times, but bar service has been a bit friendlier.  can't say enough about the amazing food. i believe we actually fought over the waffles last time. i'd pass on the lobster mac if i went back, but most everything else was delicious.   definitely recommend this for a date night. it's the perfect neighborhood restaurant!</u_review>
<b_review>this place is super yummy!  i do miss my favorite gelato scooper hannah grout however!  its the friendly employees that make my visits enjoyable!</b_review>
<b_review>mmmmmm.  new flavors to try (pana cotta, apple, pineapple)!  staff was super friendly and helpful.  the gelato was delish and reasonably priced.  open til 10 pm on fri and sat, which is purdy dang good for mesa.</b_review>
<b_review>when you promise desert to a three year old, you had better come through...they have minds like steel traps!  so the moment we finished lunch, my daughter lovingly reminded us about our aforementioned promise.  we went next door to angel sweet, not knowing exactly what to expect. i had heard lots of great things, but you never really know for sure about something until you try it yourself. after all..."opinions" and whatnot...  at first glance, the facility comes across as small. there are only three tiny tables inside, each with two chairs, and all in very close proximity to one another. now, there are a few random seats near the window, and there's a park style bench on the wall under a mural of a couple of small shops, i can only assume italian. my first thought was, "i'll bet this place gets uncomfortably crowded during the peak summer months." but, i digress.  when you look at the displays for the various gelato flavors, you understand where all of the square footage went for this building. there are at least 20 different varieties of gelato, each flavor laid out like a work of art under that glass. it almost makes you want to eat them all (*notice: do not attempt this ridiculous feat!!! that would be gastrointestinal suicide).  we had plenty of time to study the flavors on our inaugural trip, as the gelato pusher was nowhere to be found. for a brief second, i thought to myself, "this is going to end badly...). moments later, i realized why there was a little hold up...the gelato man emerged from the back room with two more gelato trays to fill a couple of voids under the glass.   his emergence might as well have been in slow motion. he was carrying two heaping masses of fresh gelato art. i think i saw smoke...and possibly doves. there might have been 80's hair metal in the background. the whole thing just screamed "john woo".  after relieving himself of the two new flavors on the street, he apologized for the wait, and then explained a few things about the gelatos to us. he mentioned to us that we were allowed to sample as many flavors as we wanted. now, at most gelato places, they give you that weird square spoon to try the samples. not here. they give you full sized plastic teaspoons!  i only needed one sample. the panna cotta was awesome! i they offer a variety of cones, but i always go for ice cream in a cup (you know...to avoid the extra calories). they offer small, medium large, and kid's sized cups. within the small, medium and large cups, you are allowed to mix up to three flavors. in the kid's cup, you can only mix two.   now, usually, when you get ice cream in a cup, there's lots of leftover space after the attendant scoops in your confection. not here. this guy filled this cup like he was filling a hole in drywall, and his deposit depended on it!  in retrospect, i should have ordered the kid's cup. this gelato is hea-vy!!! there's a disclaimer about that very fact next to the cash register, but i guess i was too mesmerized by the beautiful gelato to notice until it was too late.  bottom line...this place is awesome!!! just remember to heed the warning. a little of this stuff goes a long way!</b_review>
<b_review>gorgeous gelato!!! and near my home! so thrilling! :d their prices are reasonable, the place is squeaky clean, and the staff is friendly. i enjoy their extra super dark chocolate (forget the actual name), panna cotta, and coconut.. also love pistachio! :d</b_review>

<text>so, unfortunately, last time we ordered from boombozz, it was not good... maybe it was a bad night, but i have to update my thoughts to be honest.  the wheat crust was horrible! it was like cardboard. very flat & not at all pleasing to the palate. the portabella 1/2 of our pizza at least made up for flavor, but the fajita 1/2 was very plain tasting. we were very sad & marked it up to a new chef or something, but very discouraged to try again. we have liked it so much in the past, that we will be willing to go again, but after that experience, it isn't very high on our list.  they have digressed.  sorry.</text>
<u_review>we just happened upon this cafe via our gps & wow were we pleasantly surprised!! my husband being from sf & my many trips there has taught me a lot about the mediocre coffee offered here in town. when i walked into solo cafe... it was like i had ventured on a trip to a cozy, special little place tucked away in the streets of san francisco! the vibe was cool, the decor was great, the service was personal & the coffee was an awesome change from the usual starbucks. it just felt good!! the ambiance alone won me over. we are excited to make this a regular weekend trip! great job going solo!!!</u_review>
<u_review>we found this restaurant through yelp & it had a good rating but mixed reviews, so we ventured there with no expectations... we were pleasantly satisfied! the jalapeno poppers with crab were some of the best poppers i've ever had... they are a must try! there weren't many patrons, at one point we were the only ones there at about 5pm on a friday evening, that could have been a concern being a sushi place, but the food/fish was fresh & delicious. we have it on our list of must go again. the service was excellent! thank you! (they are currently offering 20% off all day happy hour on sushi rolls only)</u_review>
<u_review>solid 3-1/2+ stars. 'cheers' kind of feeling in this place. friendly service. great for watching ufc fights! nice beer selection. good people watching. check-in offer is great except for the fact that you really have to hate ac/dc. (wink wink) food has its ons & offs but they get creative with the specials menu & offer some good food. clean environment. we are regulars on fight nights.</u_review>
<u_review>i have been a member here for a little less than a year. we go about 2-3x a week & love it! we bought the year pass because it was cheaper that way & we wanted to be more committed than the daily or monthly pass. i have been a member at other gyms but not as impressed as i am with the atmosphere here at tumbleweed. it has an indoor track to get out of the az heat. the gym also offers racquetball which is a fun alternative to workout. they offer an array of classes (zumba, yoga, pilates, core conditioning, etc)  which are included in your membership!!!!. you can't find those options for the same rate anywhere else that i know of. the people are professional & friendly - there is no haggling over membership price, commitment, or being approached by personal trainers. on that note, they do not have any personal trainers, which if you are someone who needs motivation or accountability, this probably wouldn't be the place for you. but for the price & option of the daily pass - you could bring a workout buddy anytime!!!  the other side to joining a rec center is that you are supporting your city & giving back to the community - not supporting some big money hungry corporation!   check it out!!!</u_review>
<b_review>let me start saying that the place is great. nice setting, great bar, pretty spacious, private dining room for parties...  service was pretty good too.  the food was above ok but not memorable. the "food network" pizza was oily but tasted ok. the other pizza (with several ingredients) was better.  i like that the servings are fair but not massive.  my only 3 concerns were that when we got in there was a smell that i couldn't figure out what it was but it was close to a smelly rag. the men's room wasn't clean (not a wreck but not clean) and the ac could freeze an eskimo.  nice addition to the area.</b_review>
<b_review>this is another great family place with great dishes.  you can sit inside or out and the wait staff is very friendly.  one of my soon to become regular spots.</b_review>
<b_review>friendly service, amazing food and comfy patio. we had fritters, salad and pizza. the half and half is the way to go because its so hard to choose.</b_review>
<b_review>we sat on the patio when the weather was rather chilly, we were told the heaters should be fixed sometime in several months. i ordered a plain chicken breast and lettuce and tomato, i was charged 10.99, which was ridiculous. been there twice and both times were a huge disapointment, there are so many better places to eat at!</b_review>

<text>i was sitting at my desk today bored to death.  i began to think "what should i have for lunch today?".  i am completely burnt out on fast food, burgers etc.   at that moment i remembered taste of italy.  i figured, that would be something different so i jumped in my truck and headed that way.    i arrived and walked in.  the owner recognized me and took my order right away.  i ordered a meatball sub and side salad.  he made the salad right then and off i went while they worked on the sub.  i think you might be hard pressed to find a fresher salad.  it was crispy and clean and had excellent flavor.  so, my sub was brought out about the time i was finished with my salad.  the roll was perfect, the cheese melted and the meatballs were very good.  the only problem is that my phone rang just as i took a bite.  so, what to do?  i now have a scorching hot meatball in my mouth and trying to talk on the phone at the same time.  the cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth and burnt, my eyes watered and i could not talk....   one slurp of diet coke and i was saved....   i am sure this has happened to all of you once in your life.     well, to wrap up my review, i had an awesome lunch and a good price.  clean surroundings and great service....     i think its as good as it gets!</text>
<u_review>we have been here many times and the food and service are always good.  the prices are reasonable.  my wife and kids love the sushi.</u_review>
<u_review>lunch today with the lovely wife at smashburger.  the service was good.  we both had burgers and we split onion rings (or whatever they call them) and fries.  i had the smashburger fries and they were ok but could have been better.  the are seasoned and have olive oil on them which is ok but there was a bit much for my liking.  the burgers were good and we sat out side which was pretty nice.  we will be returning.    the bill:   two 1/3 pound burgers, one order of fries and onion rings and two sodas.  $19.00.  they also have a decent selection of bottled beers.  almost forgot to mention that!</u_review>
<u_review>we made a trip to first watch on the way to the airport to take our daughter so she could catch a flight to texas.  i know what you are thinking..."why would anyone want to go to texas on purpose?".  she really does have a good reason, so off we went.  we walked in and they seated us right away.  our waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink order.  she introduced herself as "lindsay", and i am sure she is not the "milkoholic lindsay" from the e-trade commercial.  she did a great job for us.  our food came out quickly and it was quite tasty.  lindsay checked on us quite a few times as we ate and refreshed our drinks.   we will be returning for another visit.     the valley needs more places that have a good to great breakfast...!</u_review>
<u_review>i took my wife to brunch on mothers day.  we had an awesome time.  the service was perfect and so was the food.  in my opinion you couldnt have done a much better job!</u_review>
<b_review>if you're ever in the west valley, say goodyear area, i would truly recommend brother's pizza express. it's a great mom and pop place you can't really get in phoenix. the owners came from nyc - those new yorkers just know how to make great pizza! :)  i think i'm going to make it a tradition to stop by this place on my way to or from california since i'm hardly ever on the west valley.   their prices are cheap and you get your money's worth when you go. the people are very friendly and are very personable with their customers. i think if you live in the area and go their a lot it wouldn't be a bad idea to make this place your regular place for pizza.   great pizza and customer service! hope to stop by soon!</b_review>
<b_review>i live 2miles from here & i finally came to try out their pizza.....why didn't i come here before this pizza is excellent.... will make this my new pizza place...overall the place is really clean & the owner actually greets the customers; which i thought was pretty cool, makes you feel right at home....wow is an understatement.....must try this place their prices are not bad..</b_review>
<b_review>so far just tried their napolitana pepperoni pizza. good. real greasy but it's a pizza with pepperoni slices. i've ordered pizza twice & will review the other foods when tried.</b_review>
<b_review>the one thing i notice about the pizza in this town is that its all the same. i can name at least four different new york style (big slice) pizza joints in goodyear and they all taste about the same. this place has a bit more foot traffic than the rest of them but is nothing special to me. the prices are average; the service is average.</b_review>

<text>update: shady's has some serious doorperson issues for a small lounge.  i was a regular here for a while since i am a big fan of the jukebox, cheap strong pours, super clean bathroom, lounge seating and some of the bar set up. i have had some good times here.   over the past year and a half, i have to say i have witnessed some serious attitude at the door, more than any club in scottsdale. one friend, a 5'4 red haired guy wearing a new kids on the block sleeveless shirt was denied admission, i finally hassled w/the bartender and gave me an extra shirt for him to wear since he was visiting out of town. it really soured everyones mood, i am sure the no sleeveless rule is intended for the wifebeaters the "locals" who may want a beer in hipster enclave may disturb.  i couldnt' convince anyone with me that night to go back, i was convinced it was a fluke.  but each time i went back, i felt a distinct bad feeling from the rude and dismissing door douches, the bartenders in general felt less friendly, the crowd more douchey and not fun to start casual conversations with at all, and all those annoying chairs just stitting in the middle of the bar starting to get on my nerves.  i went there recently with a co-worker, parents are from the caribbean, and were immediately met with hostility at the door. i was embarrassed at that point. we were ignored for a drink for a while, managed to find a seat and everyone pretty much stared at us. i felt terrible bringing my friend to what i realise is an exclusive, asshole drenched place and realized all my friends had been right before.  i really can't feel good about promoting this place anymore, the magic is definitely gone on how i feel about shady's-i still love the space, but that is it.</text>
<u_review>having been such a fan of teaxluxe in cambridge, ma and providence, ri, i was so stoked to see a tea place had opened up in tempe. unfortunately it happens to be in the tempe marketplace aka suburban exile, it is near the bookstore and the night gallery for asu and some nice seating outdoors to make up for it.  when i first entered, i felt intense deja vu-like this place looked exactly like tealuxe from the dark wood paneling, counter set up, tea menu, sophisticated booth seating with large mirrors and tea sets for sale. i mentioned it to the barista and she informed me the owner actually moved here from boston and based it off tealuxe-wha!  i was so stoked, i felt like i was in a special twilight zone episode where you get to go home again...only instead of harvard yard outside the doors you get kids with drooping diapers running in a dirty water sprinkler in a mall-well, you can't have it all.    chai, soy based too, boba, loose tea, delcious cold tea of the day, i wish they had the same food at tealuxe, where they served crumpets, salads and perfect little sandwiches and coffee cakes instead of the usual muffins, tarts, etc, which is their only docked star.  otherwise a fantastic place to relax to read or surf the net and sip perfect tea!</u_review>
<u_review>"maize's: it will do" and "the garlic bread was good" are the two main slogans i can think of for maize's.  i really liked the ambiance of the inside, i like the bar, the wine bottle display, the tables where everyone munched on regular sized sandwiches and the patio looking at the light rail is pretty sweet.  if i lived around here, it would be an easy "go to place" for happy hour w/great beer, wine selection and cheap burgers for the carnies-it has a no nonsense charm that i can't seem to replicate in colour scheme except you could take a hipster and your dad here-and that is pretty rare around phoenix.  i have a limited palate for american food (being vegetarian, lactose intolerant but willing to eat eggs and some seafood if no meat/cheese free dishes, most american style places mean: fries or salad. big whoop), but i went for the simple garden salad w/the side of garlic bread and just a water. it was really good. that was it. am i gonna go out of my way for the garlic bread and garden salad here? um...no.  the service was just kind of weird. nice, but sometimes i felt i was having communication breakdowns with all the hosts, servers and the random older owner that ran out w/hot sauce for mr. k when he was almost done w/his eggs. there were a lot of raised eyebrows exchanged at the table, and i even whispered "was i really weird? did i not make sense?" and it kept happening. like a waiter-customer vortex where each party thinks the other one means something else at all times.   so once again, "maize's: it will do" and "the garlic bread was good".</u_review>
<u_review>i had heard quite a bit about shake! the dance night on saturday night so decided since rogue bar was so close and i missed dancing to hot lunch terribly in boston, this would fit the ticket.   i almost totally missed the bar and the parking lot is limited so i just parked on the side street next to the bar. the door guy was pretty friendly and it was a 3 buck cover charge. to the left was an elevated dance floor with the dj booth sunken in. there were two stairs leading to the stage with some people dancing. a larger crowd was just...watching the dancing. huh. the bar was l-shaped and wrapped around 3 ladies working fast and hard to get drinks to the black t-shirted crew. my g&t was super strong and cheap at 3 bucks..but no lime? it was so loud i couldnt even ask her for one. behind the bar were high rise table with tall stools, a large tv showing concert footage, more wrap around booths that didnt look too inviting, a pool table smack in the middle of hall was blanketed. there were more tables located to the back of the bar but it was so dense with groups of people sitting in large herds i didnt look very inviting to mill around. i didn't even bother seeing what the bathroom was like.  over all, a younger crowd. if anyone was over 31, they must be a young 31. mostly early to mid 20s. it shifted from more men to more women constantly, but in the end the group mentality shifted to women. the crowd was pretty dressed up-purses, dresses, tats showing, make up did, the guys had ties or gelled up hair appropriately. it was really smokey in there, to the point i smoked cigarettes outside. the music was loud and focused on punk and alt-punk, some glam thrown in.   overall not a bad time, but i def. felt older at 27 in the room.</u_review>
<u_review>3 and a half, really  my first experience at bs west was at a glaad event with my lady friend from outta state to experience gay snobbsdale...for charity!! and booze!  it was really hard to find this place and we just opted for 5 buck valet service rather than dealing with the headache of parking on a friday night in scottsdale. we had to wander around some guys in tuxes playing classical music outside some chi chi restaurant (?) before finally finding bs west. since i had paid for our membership to glaad, we got to go upstairs and start boozin. absolut drinks free-all right! i even got some nifty absolut rainbow sweat bands (sweeeet for tennis!) and i liked the bartenders a lot. unfortunately there were like no ladies...or they were straight. snark. we still had a great time, and i had to go to mickeys hangover near by to eat something, that is  how much free booze i consumed.   other times i have been here has been on wednesdays-omg, the pheremones here are lavish. oozing with testorone and doin' it juice. and of course...no ladies who like ladies. well, maybe one lady couple. out of a thousand gay guys. sigh. but it was 2-4-1 night and i got rightly hammered. the bartenders here are super nice and never felt ignored-although you might get quicker service upstairs if you can manage the stairs. i dance, even though the dance floor isn't always jumping-i mean fergie remix? i am there, ready to hump an unsuspecting male with a faux hawk! there is a smoking courtyard where it seems some hookups occur with ravishing frequency-jinkies! who knew marlboro reds incurred such ravenous carnal desires?  overall, a good time with friends with hardly any for the gay lady in your life...unless you spend that 35 bucks on glaad and get free booze at any glaad event (yay! booze for social justice)...</u_review>
<b_review>quiet bar with awesome cocktails. friendly bartender who helped narrow down the choices of their speciality drinksfor me. my boyfriend is pretty picky about music...not wanting hear top 40 everywhere we go...the jukebox here has a great selection. wish this place was closer to our house!</b_review>
<b_review>i'm going to have to grab a tweed sports coat and an elvis wig from the goodwill before i go back to shady's.  my "modern" style of dress doesn't seem to be accepted among this "non-judgemental" group of individuals.  i've been there 2-3 times and i always feel like i came from the future and the locals cannot believe what they are seeing.  more then once i have felt like blood was about to pour from the ceiling and i was going to be swarmed by a secret society of hipster vampires as i played a game of pool on their table.  the inside is very small and cluttered with far too much furniture.  the front patio is too cramped and is in serious need of expansion.  alas, they make excellent drinks, and a relative works there, so i gave it two stars.</b_review>
<b_review>tiny inside, with about a medium-sized bar, a few lounge chairs, one pool table, and a wall lined with booths around the pool table.  the decor is hipster heaven - i mean, wood paneling??  late 70s tiled bathroom???  physical-menu jukebox (well, cds, i mean this is 2009 for crying out loud, but still you don't see just a ton of those), and two tiny tvs????  i don't like hipsters very much, but i need me some wood paneling in my house.  and i loved the bathroom, i'm just gonna say.  it was clean!!! total win.  anyway, the crowd was totally hipster-rriffic-esque, meaning it was people like me who identify w/ the hipster ethos but don't go all the way.  pretty normal-looking, in other words, chill.  re-reading those sentences, even i don't know what i mean. so i'll move on. it wasn't too packed on a thursday night, we got some songs played on the jukebox  but there was no silence, and people were shooting pool the whole time.  actually on two separate breaks there were balls and change flying at our table, and a couple other occasions we had to make a little extra space for the players to shoot.  it's a really intimate space, unfortunately for me my female companions enjoyed the invasion more than i did.  i could have sworn that stupid cowboy was speaking w/ an aussie accent. so freaking cliche.  why don't more cute women play pool??? moving on. the bartender, while totally cute, ignored me for at least 5 minutes while chatting with a patron about her hair.  i'm like, hello... i want to give you money....!  it wasn't too too bad though.  they tap newcastle, bud light, and stella artois, and one pint of each cost me $11.50. i'm not totally sure how that breaks down but whatever, it wasn't bad.  parking: apparently they just put up no parking signs on the street adjacent to the bar, so you get to park in the neighborhood behind the place.  great.  we didn't have to walk too far tho, so it's tolerable.   all told i had a great time at shady's and it seemed like a pretty cool place, i wouldn't hesitate to go back as long as it's not too packed.  there's not really anywhere to stand up even, so any more crowded than it was on thursday and it wouldn't have been fun.</b_review>
<b_review>not fancy indeed, but a good environment to have some drinks.   i only got shocked to order a piña colada and was denied. after that  the bartender offered he could prepare any cocktail (except piña colada). anyway, i did got a chance to try other shots and enjoy all the time the good attention.</b_review>

<text>the food has really gone downhill.  i used to go here all the time when i lived on that side of town but the last few times i've gone the sushi was horrible.  maybe it was an off day? i might venture back to see if this was the case.</text>
<u_review>silvermine is great.  i order from here all the time.  they deliver until 3 am and they have a pretty extensive sandwhich menu.  the only downer is that a prereq to work here is that you must smoke massive amounts of weed sooo order your sandwhich very clearly and make sure they repeat it. : )</u_review>
<u_review>my grandmother worked here like a hundred years ago before it moved to the current location on 35th ave. so...i have been eating here since the beginning of time, which was, of course, the day i was born.  the food is always good.  i love love the salsa.  the hot sauce is not my favorite but whatev.  if you do not speak spanish you might also have trouble with the staff and sometimes they are not the friendliest but thats ok with me becuase the food is always good. : )</u_review>
<u_review>this week we hosted our annual sales meeting at the hampton inn on highland. first off, the staff was amazing. they were the highlight of our stay. from the front desk staff to the event managers, they were always friendly and on top of all of our needs. the space they were able to provide us was great even though we made changes at the last minute to the head count they did everything possible to make our conference room comfortable. the continental breakfast was great - including waffles, bagels, breakfast meats, coffee, and healthy options too. this helped us to cut down on costs for providing breakfast for all our out of town guests. all in all, i would highly recommend the hampton inn for a work conference or a family stay. they have great amenities like a heated pool and the staff is incredible.</u_review>
<u_review>i thought this place was alright. if someone wanted to check it out i would go back but i wouldn't recommend it when picking a place to eat.  the menu is kind of small and there is really only sushi which is fine but if you have a non-sushi eating person in the group this place would not work.   we went here on a sunday afternoon at noonish and stayed for quite awhile....no one else came in while we were there.  this sort of freaked me out.  anyway the sashimi and sushi were fine. nothing amazing but not bad at all.  the one thing i did not like was the spicy tuna roll was pretty big.  i can't stand that. anyway, its ok. check it out and decide for yourself.</u_review>
<b_review>this is a pretty good place for happy hour.  decent sushi in a hip environment.  i like the music they play.  this last visit my cal roll, octopus, salmon and tuna selections were just fine. a tall, cold sapporo is always great.  it seemed that the servers were not quite as cute or friendly as in years past.  maybe it's just me?</b_review>
<b_review>i am visiting scottsdale for 10 weeks and found sushi broker closest to my place. the first time i went, i went with my friend from japan. we both enjoyed the sushi and found some rolls better then others. my japanese friend was happy with the quality and taste....she has much more experience with sushi then i do.   we did go during happy hour and thus the prices were very good.  the second time i went, i had a good experience.  although, with the spicy tuna and spicy salmon, there is too much heat and thus it looses the taste of the fish.    both visits we really liked any of the rolls that used the eel sauce. very tasty.  both times we went during happy hour.</b_review>
<b_review>i have heard nothing but great things about sushi brokers from my friends and other locals. so when my friends and i decided to meet there for reverse happy hour i was really excited. once we got there we were barely greeted and were treated as an annoyance. once seated our waiter was less than thrilled to accommodate any of our needs. once the food and drinks were out there were many mistakes made. my friends and i were nothing but polite and ate the food that was brought out.   overall the food and drinks were very tasty and definitely worth going back for. the service on the other hand was lousy . i will try sushi brokers again in hopes for better service. luckily their product is great :)</b_review>
<b_review>i'm always impressed when a landlocked state has good sushi, and this place did. since it was a monday during happy hour, it was a bit quieter and the service was prompt.   the 5 of us tried a variety of items (from the tuna to the cowgirl) and everything was very fresh.  we also enjoyed some bomber beers and cocktails that were $2.00 off. overall, we had a great experience.  i would definitely go again at happy hour, next time we visit.  our sushi, a kobe burger, and drinks came to $140.00, before tip.  not bad for the amount of sushi we ordered.</b_review>

<text>i think this spot must have lost its mojo.  there are only a handful of flavors to choose from and none of them stood out.  all but two of those flavors were fat-free, but we'd never have know if we didn't ask.  you'd think it would be posted along with the flavor.  there's also a very serious lack of toppings at this location compared to some of the others.  i already hate that the yogurt is always soft at these self-serve yogurt places, but it was really bad at this mojo.  when my girlfriend pulled the lever for the chocolate it came out very soupy.  the girl at the counter told her that it always comes out that way.  if that's the case, the manager should probably look into getting that machine fixed.   on the plus side, the sample cups are left up front, so it's easy to test a flavor without having to ask.  the storefront is set up nicely considering it's so small.  if you're looking for something to satisfy your sweet tooth, and happen to be in city north, then mojo is an alright place to stop into.  but i wouldn't recommend going out of your way to eat at this mojo.</text>
<u_review>i guess this is the best mall option for people in the west valley.  a lot of places around arrowhead also make it an attractive shopping and dining destination.  pretty much all of the big box and anchor stores are in the mediate area, although driving across bell at anytime of the day can be a major headache.  i think it could be a lot better.  then again, it could be a lot worse.  arrowhead towne center itself could use a little bit of an update.  it was built in the 90's, but feels even older.</u_review>
<u_review>a really cool trendy burger bar just north of downtown phoenix.  the contemporary ambiance gives off a really fun vibe that makes it feel cool from the moment you walk through the door.  i went with the fez burger.  if they're going to stamp their name on it, it should be good.  it's topped with spicy honey molasses barbecue, cinnamon pears, feta cheese, a lemon garlic aioli, and crispy onions.  like all of fez's burgers it comes on a ciabatta bun, and the patty is shaped rectangular so it fits perfectly. awesome that i never took a bite of just bread.  all the stuff on the few burger is very flavorful, but i think it over compensated for a less than stellar patty.  i wasn't too keen on the quality of the beef (plus, mine was undercooked, but not enough to complain.  my girlfriend actually said that her burger tasted overcooked, but also not enough to complain).  the salad that comes with the burger is quite tasty as well.  you can also substitute for fries for an up charge, but if you're with a group it's a much better deal to order a basket of fries.  the customer service is terrific.  our waitress was a little slow, but she made up for it with a really cool act.  after a man at the table next to us got on a very loud and uncomfortable rant, yelling at the woman he was with (i don't want to get into what we was saying, but let's just say i was very happy that she got up and walked out on him), the waitress brought a free dessert to our table for having to sit through that.  it was totally unnecessary, but a wonderful gesture.  i'm going to say that fez was more of a three-and-a-half star experience, but deserves to be rounded up to four.  although i think the place misses out on what's key (the chief should focus on a better beef patty and not all the fixings), there's so much that unique and done well at fez that i still walked away from an enjoyable dining experience, with a desire to give the restaurant another try.</u_review>
<u_review>you can find queen creek olive mill's stuff at stores all around arizona, but it's definitely worth taking the drive out to the far east valley (at least once) to see the farm with your own eyes.  they even offer a quick tour of the mill for just $5.  you won't see too much, but you will learn that there's more to the process of making extra virgin olive oil than you ever imagined.  it would probably be best to take the tour during the fall and winter months, when they are harvesting the olives.  qcom's olive oils are nothing short of amazing!  a two cup bottle may seem a little pricey at first glance, but when you try it, you'll know you're not tasting the cheap stuff from the grocery store.  even better, there's a little bar in the back of retail and dining area where you can sample all of the olive oils, vinegars and tapenades.  the only disappointment is the lack of bread.  all qcom offers is a little shot cup.  a sign says that it's because they want you to experience the pure taste (but they'll gladly sell you a small piece of bread if you want it).  lunch at the cafe was delicious.  my girlfriend and i weren't too hungry so we decided to split a panini.  we had the manzi.  chicken with fontina cheese, basil, sun dried tomato.  it also has qcom's parmesan tapenade and white balsamic and herb crema.  it also comes with potato chips.  we also split a s'more bruschetta.  honey mascarpone and nutella.  a fantastic dessert.  the food filled us up for the rest of the afternoon.  if it's a nice day, i highly recommend eating outside.  it took well over an hour to get from north phoenix to qcom.  i really can't imagine going out of my way to check it out again anytime in the near future.  but like i said, it's worth at least a onetime checkout.  if you have any visitors in town, and are looking for a way to entertain them, take them out to qcom.</u_review>
<u_review>decent, but uninspired mexican food.  there's nothing bad about los olivos.  the place certainly uses quality ingredients to make its food.  too bad what end up on the plate was just plain average.  i had the fish tacos and was not impressed.  the fish itself had no taste.  all it really provided was some texture (and hopefully protein).  without the lime and the sauce and salsa, which are all served on the side, it offered no flavor to the dish.  couldn't it at least be seasoned a little bit?  my girlfriend had the chicken quesadilla with a side of guacamole.  this was pretty good and huge.  it could easily serve two or three people.  the chips and salsa are wonderful.  the hot salsa perfectly delivers quite a kick.  the mild was incredibly flavorful.  the cilantro really stood out.  however, i am not a fan of the tubes the salsas are served in.   they're extremely narrow, so you cannot directly dip your chip into them.  you need to pour the salsa on a plate.  that left a narrow liquidy mess on my plate, which doesn't make for good dunking.  the restaurant itself is quite pleasant, and there is a lot of space.  i wouldn't call los olivos overpriced.  you'll get a lot of food for your money.  but, i would prefer some more quality over the quantity.</u_review>
<b_review>i love mojo yogurt! they always have a lot of flavors and toppers to pick from. i was able to get four yogurts for $10 this weekend! i also like that they have a non dairy flavor most of the time too! try the smoothies they are very good! this is a fun place to get dessert after dinner in city north. on saturday they were open until 11 p.m.</b_review>
<b_review>not very impressive ... tables and floor dirty .. i spilled accidentally and staff watched as i cleaned up with no offer of help.   left sticky residue and nobody would wipe down properly</b_review>
<b_review>this place is great! i've never been a fan of froyo, but this stuff is tasty! i tried the skinny strawberry and topped it off with mango, strawberries, blueberries, and fruity pebbles. i got the quart size (yeah, i was asking for a tummy ache, but it was worth it.) i love how it is self-serve, and you can pile whatever you want on there. it's a bit pricey at 39 cents/ounce, but if you go to their website you can print a buy one get one free coupon.</b_review>
<b_review>so my family and i tried to get some yogurt here but there was a notice on the door that the owner hasn't paid the rent and the landlord kicked them out as of 1/11/13. oh well, there's yogurt+ down the street at least.</b_review>

<text>i really hate this branch of pita jungle.  i think this is due to the college-age hippie stoner slackers that dominate the staff.  i eat at the pita jungle in scottsdale often and love it - worthy of at least 4 stars.  the tempe branch - yikes.  bad bad sloooooooooooooooooooow service. maybe i am being overly harsh but my last experience here was so bad i actually walked out of the restaurant without eating my meal or paying.  after sitting there for over an hour, they managed to serve me the same cold plate of food twice (it was supposed to be hot).  and it wasn't  even that fact that i got served cold food twice that really ticked me off.  it was that no one there - not even the manager - seemed to give a shit.  unacceptable.</text>
<u_review>loses points because it is run by the same people as electric ladyland... but the sales people here are young, harmless, and generally eager to please.  and it gets major points for carrying like, the entire joe's jeans denim collection.  i'm talking every cut in every wash.  other than that, pretty useless unless you are into the $100 used t-shirt look.</u_review>
<u_review>i'm sorry, but this place is just plain skanky.  i am all about supporting local businesses...  so long as they are clean, have a pleasant staff, and a good concept.</u_review>
<u_review>i seriously considered giving this village inn 4 stars.  i know.  it is the village inn.  let me explain...  i had just finished an hour long torture session at mesa community college's track/playing fields with a group of friends. (1) we were hungry (hungry with a capital "h").   none of us live in mesa.  no yelp due diligence had been completed on the area.  someone mentioned seeing an ihop at the corner of dobson and southern.  done.  we get there. my heart sinks.  it is not an ihop.  it is a village inn.  "oh no," i thought secretly to myself, "not the village inn." (2)  but the collective decision had been made.  the group charged in.  five minutes later, we were seated in a large u-shaped booth.  there were crumbs on the seat and little hand prints all over the mirror behind us.  children were here before us.  a busboy promptly cleaned up the mess.  by this point, my expectations could not have gotten any lower.  i scanned the menu in despair thinking, "that sounds good, but can it be properly executed at a village inn?"  our server, danny d. arrived.  he greeted us with much enthusiasm and a genuine smile.   he began taking orders, making his way around the table.  by the time he got to me, i was still at a loss.  i looked at him and stated, "i have a problem with the menu."  "okay... what's the problem."  "nothing is quite what i want." i describe the breakfast that i do want, a veggie omelet with real eggs, buttermilk pancakes, and fruit on the side. (3)  "no problem.  we can do that."  my mood brightened.  after about 10 minutes the food arrived.  it looked pretty good.   and then i took a bite.  the eggs were light and fluffy, good veggie to omelet ratio, just the right amount of cheese, and piping hot.  somewhat stunned, i stated, "wow, this is actually really good."  my friends look similarly stunned.  my feelings were echoed.  "yeah, my food is really good too."  "me too."  "me too."  "this is fantastic."   "my taste buds are so happy right now." to top it all off,  danny d. was a total rock star server, circling back to bring extra condiments, more napkins, and fresh coffee throughout the meal, and always with a palpable sense of brightness and cheer.  maybe it was a fluke experience.  maybe we were all so hungry that dog food would have tasted good? but then again, maybe not.  maybe this village inn is just a diamond in the rough?  only time will tell.    (1) see my review regarding iron gloves boxing located in tempe, arizona for more information.    (2)  my experience with this particular chain has not been good.  i have bad memories of going to a village inn in albuquerque with my grandparents and being forced to eat rubbery inedible scrambled eggs. sometimes with hair.  (3)  the veggie omelet is a "healthy" menu item.  ordered standard, it is made with egg substitute and served with whole grain pancakes.</u_review>
<u_review>okay spot for lunch.  the salads are pretty good.  a little pricey for what you get.  i wouldn't drive here to eat lunch, but if you work within walking distance it is a reasonable alternative.</u_review>
<b_review>i like this place. prior to my east coast foodies event there, i had never been to pita jungle. everyone has said how amazing they are. so, when i found out that they have happy hour, i set up an event and off us foodies went.  my fellow foodies enjoyed $2.00 beers, and $4.00 glasses of wine ( i believe) and the happy hour food menu was great! i really enjoyed my falafel, side of lentils/brown rice, and carmelized cauliflower! what a filling and healthy meal.  i will go back very soon for happy hour.  love,  the east coast foodie</b_review>
<b_review>i had a lunch date here today, and initially was not happy with her choice of restaurants. the first time i had pita jungle, i was not impressed and wondered why everyone raved about it. i ordered the sample platter and it was filled with things i didn't know and i was not pleased, especially when my friend's pizza looked so good.   today's friend indicated she loved pita jungle and had been craving it,  so i followed her lead and ordered something more reasonable. we started with a cilantro-jalapeno hummus and it was very good! we each also ordered the glazed chicken lavosh pizza, which was huge! really we could have shared one pizza, but the benefit was she could take some home to her son. the lavosh bread provided a nice crust different from traditional pizza. she tells me it reheats well - bonus!  the one thing that was a downer for me is something that happens to me constantly. as you can see from my pictures and reading prior reviews, i am not a small dude. regardless of the restaurant or the person i am with they love to cram me in the smallest possible tables.  this was no exception. a small table for two, but with the hummus, the water, the plate for the bread - there was little room for two plates of pizza. i really disliked being cramped at the table. the place was busy, but had open seats - some of which would be more accommodating .</b_review>
<b_review>no wifi = zero stars.  hh menu items are microscopic.  no bar, only a bar rail at kitchen, which is hot.  no tvs.  poor service.</b_review>
<b_review>i had high hopes coming here, but i just have never left feeling satisfied. not a terrible place to eat, but nothing memorable. kind of bland.</b_review>

<text>i was literally scared of going in here for a few months after it opened, because i know nothing about cheese and wine. the place is so small that i thought as soon as i walked in, i'd be sniffed out as an amateur and tables full of socialites would begin laughing at me as they stared through their monocles.   not at all! it is very friendly and unassuming. the staff is laid back and helpful, and they appear to have many great little plates on offer. my wife and i stopped in just for a glass of wine, and it was very nice.  i can't wait to go back and try some of their meat and cheese offerings--it looks like a great place to have a relaxed and quiet lunch.</text>
<u_review>i love whole foods. i take my kids here once a week at night to grab dinner and we can all get something healthy and fresh. the selection of food here, both ready-to-eat and packaged, is phenomenal. the prices are competitive unless you really buy the premium stuff, so there are a lot of choices.  the employees are knowledgeable and will help you find stuff. many of them can spout off all kinds of information about their area of specialty. think you can call a safeway asking for some weird kind of apple, and not only have the produce manager know the growing season and geography of that apple, but offer to call you when they get it in? no, no, y no. call whole foods, for sure.  every time i've asked for something at whole foods, they go above and beyond. last night i asked for corn syrup, and an employee practically hurdled the customer service counter in their haste to help me find it. they looked genuinely sorry that they didn't have it.  also, they have a liberal return policy. this is good in case a naive and overambitious consumer accidentally buys a really smelly cheese and stanks up his car with it and then wants to return it just for being a huge mistake. not that i know anything about that.  anyway, you can't go wrong here.</u_review>
<u_review>it's been quite a while since i was at ck's, but i stopped in with a friend to watch a basketball game and i'm glad to say everything here is still top-notch.  the service is friendly and very efficient, as others have mentioned. the servers seem to be there when you need them without being intrusive, which is the thing every server should shoot for. the food remains good as well--i finally got a chance to try the raspberry chipotle sauce and it is excellent! lots of local beers on tap as well.  ck's is definitely a sports bar and they have a lot of nice tvs around showing any sporting event that's on tv. it's quite a social place as well, and there are many groups of regulars that frequent the patio area and the bar area.</u_review>
<u_review>really nice concept!  like a lot of other places in scottsdale, it tries to be a bit more hip than need be, but i guess you have to play to your audience. the decor is interesting but definitely form over function. i felt like i did the time i accidentally sat in a chair at a modern art gallery that was actually meant to be an exhibit.  like a previous reviewer mentioned, it's a tad annoying that the diet cola comes in a little glass bottle, basically preempting the possibility of any refills. as a diner, i like that soda to flow and flow. it's my method of portion control. it's not cute, at all. it's just annoying. so, minus one star for the uncomfortable decor and little glass bottles.  the rest of it was an easy "a". the sliders are awesome and there is enough variety to suit anyone (other than my vegan brothers and sisters, holla!). we also got an order of tots which was plenty to share. if you're a light eater, definitely do not order more than two sliders. but, if you're a might peckish or william "refrigerator" perry, go for three or more.  actually, if you're the fridge, get four or five.</u_review>
<u_review>went here with a large group for a holiday lunch.  it was... just okay. we pick a different restaurant every year, and we've yet to hit a jackpot. but, hey, free lunch.  the server was really nice but made some noob mistakes like not writing down the table positions of who ordered what. what ensued was a bunch of people circling the table for 10 minutes going, "turkey club? turkey club?" no one ever did own up to that turkey club. i got the fish and chips which were long john silver-esque. definitely not impressed.  their beers are okay but i didn't order any on this particular trip. maybe the food is more impressive after a few kiltlifters?</u_review>
<b_review>finally!  a cute little wine and cheese shop in ahwatukee.  i haven't had any cheese yet, but i will on tuesday night when we go for dan h's art premiere.  i did enjoy a lovely glass of champagne and i must say that a glass of champagne first makes my trader joe's shopping all the more pleasurable.</b_review>
<b_review>a strip mall in ahwatukee is home to the arizonian best cheese shop i've ever been to.  - rennet types are listed & very much appreciated. - sammiches are all varieties of cheesy and bready, but consistently quality.  - the selection of cheese truffles will make you forget you're in a strip mall in ahwatukee.   it's pricey, but it's worth it. sit outside, get some cheesy morsels, and revel in it.   can't get enough? also bring a metric sh*t ton of goodies home with you, then say to your significant other, "we don't need no money, baby, we got everything we need right here." *smile and point to massive assortment of cheeses that just cost you the remnants of your joint bank account*</b_review>
<b_review>i just love this place and especially love the fact that i live within walking distance. they always have a nice selection of meats, cheese, wine and beer. their sandwiches are super yummy too. the thing that i like most though is that this husband and wife team are passionate about what they do and always have the best recommendations. cute little spot.</b_review>
<b_review>my new favorite place in chandler. the food is excellent. the items they sell in the store are unique and delicious and the staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.  don't be fooled by the imported cheese and meat selections at your local supermarkets. wedge & bottle truly takes the time to choose the best of the best when it comes to their offerings. they will give you a back story all the way from the name of the farm and owner that their products come from, along with the reasons they decided to carry it.   icing on the cake? wine and cheese pairing classes. cider and cheese pairing. monthly wine tasting. these aren't your bevmo "wine tastings", where they try to sell you the flavor of the week. everything at wedge & bottle represents a true love for the art of fine food and drink.</b_review>

<text>still a fan because i love the beer selection, and the venue. but, i want to update because the gnocchi has gotten a little chef-boy-ardee-ish. not inedible but not as impressive as it once was...  so, i guess, i retract my love for the gnocchi but there's still a lot to love about this place!</text>
<u_review>good car wash and, it's true, no one tries to up-sell you. but, i am not a fan of having to drive through myself... plus, it felt like the world's longest car wash! my car is clean and the price is right. i'll be back and -- who knows -- i may grow to love the place!</u_review>
<u_review>$22 pedicure. usually a wait. not a huge selection of polishes. clean, good massage and they color within the lines. solid 3 stars.</u_review>
<u_review>sunnyslope's latest addition is an upscale steak and seafood restaurant, complete with white tablecloths and live jazz music some evenings.   the large building that backs up to the canal was most recently home to the calico cow. the floral/country decor that had provided the setting for comfort food has been replaced with red walls lined with large black and white photos of celebrities like marilyn monroe and rat pack favorites.  guests can now enjoy delicious house-made new england clam chowder and perfectly seasoned, slow cooked prime rib accompanied by live jazz or in a private dining room with a western theme. when it cools off, i'm sure the patio will be a popular spot!  they have been open for one week and i've been there 3 times. here are some of the things i've tried so far:  the clam chowder ($6) was a real highlight: loaded with littleneck clams, yukon potatoes, fresh dill and double cream. this soup is not thick and corn-starchy, which usually prevents me from even considering it.   the shrimp for the shrimp cocktail ($11) is poached in riesling and served with a cocktail sauce spiked with cognac.   the steak bruschetta ($12) lines crostini with thinly sliced rare filet mignon, gorgonzola and a balsamic reduction and a pairs them with a side of diced tomato, onion and basil to be applied at your own discretion.  the prime rib ($18, $20 or $22 depending on the cut size) is perfectly seasoned and not too fatty.  the chicken lahvosh ($16) is a generous serving of 2 breasts, pounded and encrusted in lahvosh crackers. served with sautéed artichoke hearts, mushrooms and tomato in a chardonnay sauce. the night i had this there was not much sauce. i hear that is not the norm. there was so much chicken, though, i took one of the breasts home as leftovers and ate it cold the next day on a salad. it was even better the second day!!  menu items are a la carte, so if you want potatoes or veggies you'll have to add those at $5 a pop but they are served family style and there is enough for at least 3 people per serving. i've tried the whipped yukon potato that is creamy and buttery - just like mom makes! but, watch out for the potato au gratin: the table may fight over this scrumptious blend of potato, green onion and bacon loaded with jack cheese!   at lunchtime, there are a few more salads to choose from and sandwiches, burgers and wraps averaging $7-9. sandwiches are served with your choice of garlic scented fries, sweet potato fries, regular fries, salt & vinegar chips cottage cheese or coleslaw. i had the roast beef au jus with garlic fries and would have liked to see a little more meat on my sandwich and a little more salt in the au jus.   i hear great things about the blackened mahi-mahi so that's next on my list!  the owners are not new to the industry, having previously owned jackson's in flagstaff. a perfect match for sunnyslope: a close family team that loves community. you'll find them making the rounds in the dining room greeting patrons and striking up conversation. and, while an upscale dining experience, there's no pretension to be found here. i wish these guys the best of luck and welcome them to the neighborhood! it's so great to have yet another choice for dining out in sunnyslope!</u_review>
<u_review>this store is back to being mediocre. i wish they'd put a little more effort into lighting the parking lot, and offering to help customers out to their car. i wish their tollerance for loitering was lower. and, i wish their security guards would at least look more attentive... they seem to be spaced out or socializing. i had to call one's attention to the fact he missed an overhead head page asking him to go out to the gas station area. neighborhood deserves better than this.  the people who work the deli counter and the cashiers are nice...</u_review>
<b_review>how can i not have rated ohso?!  i have been here several times, but only on the back patio. its where i find myself people watching and drinking beers. i have had some of their food and it's ok, i should try this place out for dinner sometime.. but so far my rating is all about brews, clientele, atmosphere and service.   the positive.  to tell you the truth, i like it - all of it. i feel relaxed here and i enjoy a place where you can sit down and just unwind over good conversation, because it isn't obnoxiously loud here. it is like a patio should be. the beer is tasty, and there is a feelgood vibe on this dog friendly patio.   funny story. i sat here with some veterans and enjoyed a friday afternoon as the sun went down. when i was paying my bill i realized that the waitress had charged me for a drink to little. i told her about it, and she replied with "sorry, consider it military discount" and a smile. needless to say i tipped her well.   the negative. the men's room has one toilet and one urinal. this means that there will be a line on occasion. another thing, that other awesome yelpers have said before me, is that i don't like valet parking. i don't.   in summary -  it's a pleasurable visit. i would take out-of-towners here for a light meal and drinks before going somewhere else. not saying that this place dies down as the night progresses, i just don't have that knowledge. if you haven't tried it out, please do.</b_review>
<b_review>we've have stopped in here twice in the past year while visiting the phoenix area both times were excellent. the first visit we only had beer and the selection was great. the beer menu has everything a menu needs which makes selecting your beer easy. the second visit we had dinner and some beers, the food was the best i had in a while, i wish there was somewhere in my town that was this good. the service was great, we had two servers because one went on break or something and both girls were very helpful. this place is a must visit while in the valley.</b_review>
<b_review>i'm not gonna front: i applied to work at o.h.s.o., the new arcadia eatery and nano-brewery, and did not get a call back. for that reason, i totally understand if you feel this review to be biased.  that being said, i will probably be at o.h.s.o. everyday. i live in the neighborhood, am unemployed, and they have pitchers of arizona beers for 5 dollars till 5pm. hello alcoholism! when i saw this deal, i saw my life flash before my eyes and it involved a lot of weight gain mixed in with a heart attack. unfortunately, i only saw this offer after ordering a soda. (i was sweaty and out of sorts, don't judge.) so, my future would have to wait.  i'm also a vegetarian and while there are options-thankfully!-for us ninnies, i don't feel comfortable basing my entire review for things not applicable to a vast majority of the general population. just know that. that being said, i got the veggie burger with a side of yucca chips and "dipping sauce." the dipping sauce turned out to be guacamole. why they couldn't just be out in the open-it's 2011, people aren't scared of guacamole, y'all-was confusing. i felt mislead. i want some unknown dipping sauce! that's would be exciting.  but that is not reality. the yucca chips tasted like thick regular chips of good quality. the veggie burger came on a buttery challah roll and featured some cherry tomatoes that had been marinated and some greens. the actual patty tasted pretty much like a soft, large falafel croquet. it had no sauce on it from what i can tell. i asked the bartender if a condiment should be put on it and he was like, "i like ketchup and mustard on it." this, i guess, is valid. it's marketed as a burger but it still seems like heresy. everything else is abnormal about it-why would i put on the default condiments? maybe some tsatziki?  at the end of the meal, i had three samples of three beers for one dollar each. (confused?) two were from arizona-a cream ale and good vibrations-and the third was from montreal and made the other two seem like some ugz stepchildren of a beer master. so tasty, canada! while you'd get strange looks, if you were to order 4 of the montreal samples it would be the same amount of beer for fewer bucks than normal. is it worth the scorn of your bartender? that is for you to decide.  the main space is chill. in the interview, they noted how they wanted people to feel comfortable and stay for awhile. the furniture, airiness, and instructions to grab a seat wherevs ably connote this. there are tvs but they are not intrusive.  the owners were rushing to get this restaurant open and while maybe no one else cares, i feel like they could've done a bit better with the bathroom. it has been barely remodeled from the old space, which is most noticeable because everything else looks so lovely. except this weird, changing-color-announcement-board imploring you to try a beer in the foyer-that also seems out of place.  in spite of these missteps, i'm down with what these people are trying to do. they have plenty of bike parking, they play decent music, they have a good menu, they're friendly. it is hard for things to come out as envisioned. (to wit: my food photography. do you know how awesome that was gonna look in my head?) with time and work, i imagine things will get better.

<b_review>i absolutely loved the flatbread pizza. very good. i was a little disappointed with the beer though. i had the orange blossom and the orange pail. i'm not sure exactly what it was but they just seemed very hoppy or strong, but not in a good way. they were good but not great. but just my opinion. can't wait to see the outside once they are done renovating it. it was closed last week.</b_review>

<text>found a very good chinese restaraunt in chandler of all places. my order consisted of beef pies, mongolian beef, tofu, & steamed dumplings. all were good......favorite would be the meat pies. the place itself is small so get here early for dinner as it gets packed in the weekend.</text>
<u_review>a nice little hidden away place in gilbert  gf and i went there for breakfast and it was surprisingly good. i had the pancakes and meat ( sausage) and the gf had breakfast tacos (eggs, vegs, and ham). it was all good and the best part was apple fritters....it has a sugary cover to it and the inside is very soft.  this place gets packed so be ready to wait. price range is moderate for what you get. also....watch out for el scorpio....sting is muchos owie.</u_review>
<u_review>my first impression....wasn't too good as it looked not so good...they really should fix up the place. the food on the other hand...great vegetarian menu....dosa was tasty. had also dahl with rice...very good. they even have choices of chutney. i do recommend to anyone....even meat eaters.</u_review>
<u_review>subway is my secret guilty pleasure...and so is the meatball sandwich. tuna  is my next go to me hungry get in my tummy sandwich.</u_review>
<u_review>delicious macaroons! get the mini ones with diff flavors....all of them are good...especially caramel. nit good for big parties as this place is tiny. good for dates ;-)</u_review>
<b_review>highly recommended.  authentic northeast food.  customers mostly northern mandarin speakers.  so if you want to try something new and avoid the glop that passes for cantonese/sichuan (needless to say, the glop is not authentic anything), check this place out.</b_review>
<b_review>i hadn't found a chinese restaurant i liked until i went to chou's kitchen today for lunch.  my friend and i had the pork and green beens which to be honest didn't look very appetizing to me, but was delicious!  we ate the whole bowl even after being full from the dumplings.</b_review>
<b_review>homemade chinese food!  love it.  in a random strip mall in a totally unassuming area, but the place is very clean, food authentic and when we were there the ladies were making homemade dumplings right by our table.  i liked the dumplings, eggplant, and the noodles.  i'll be back again.</b_review>
<b_review>chou's was real authentic chinese.  my friend lee and i tried 6 or more dishes, which was probably enough food for four, but we were on a mission to see what this place was all about.  they actually moved us from a two-top to a four-top because we had so much food coming.    the dumplings with soup in them were great.  the beef patty wrapped in dumpling shell was very good too.  we also had the eggplant with garlic sauce (spot on) and the cumin lamb, which was really different for a chinese place, but also crazy good.    the only dish that wasn't amazing was the kung pao chicken.</b_review>

<text>we have a joke that when i die and go to heaven st. peter will meet me at the pearly gates with a cassella's chicken salad sandwich. my friend even knows how to get free babysitting out of me. yup- just give me the sub already!!!!!!hands down the best deli out of ny or chicago to be found in phoenix. small neighborhood place. their chicken salad is the best!!!! beyond the best!!!!  i wish i knew how they made it. come on guys fess up will ya?????? i have tried chicken salad in tons of different places and this is the best. for those of you lucky enough to live near granite reef and mcdonald you are so lucky!!!!!!!!i would eat here every day and be so heavy, but happy, that's for sure!i hear their other sandwiches rock too but i always just get the chicken salad because i am addicted to it and the drive is so far for me to not indulge my addiction. they also have a great vegetable cold cucumber health salad that is very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!!!</text>
<u_review>it is what it is. party city is a store i love to hate. i like to see all the cool stuff they have but they are very expensive, overpriced for the quality, do not allow returns, and give only corporations buying for more than 50 a discount. they also do not know which corporations they do offer a discount unless you are at that specific location. i find that weird in the 21st century techno world we live in.     if you need thematic party stuff you will probably find it here but at triple the price of wallymart or the dollar store. the  merchandise is different at each location and i have been bummed steer a lot on that. if you are not picky you will do well. or if you need something very specific you might be lucky here.    i do have an issue with their return policy though. i feel they are being a bit dishonest here. i recently purchased some items for a themed school book event at this maryvale location. one of the costume accessories did not work. it broke right out of the package. no returns means i got ripped off. let me tell you the ten dollar price tag on a 2 dollar item made the situation's pain a lot worse. i understand the reasoning behind no refunds on costumes but in this case they should stand behind faulty items.    i find the metro location a bit better and the chandler location the cleanest. this location is kind of gross! i usually end up buying online from stumps or windcity novelties but shop here in a pinch. balloons are super expensive here compared to dollartree but they do have some really cool designs and more variety.</u_review>
<u_review>what a lovely afternoon with fine folks and good food. viet kitchen is an aesthetically pleasing restaurant with very friendly staff members and good food. my meal was delicious. i had the stir fry--(7a) on the menu. we all shared an order of spring rolls.   the only thing strange was that our food all came out at different times instead of all at once. since it was only a minute or two apart l am okay with it i suppose. maybe this is how they do it here. that might be an issue for some old school service folks so a heads up. at this location all the staff members chip in so the food was delivered by different servers when it came up. i am okay with that since i like hot, and not sitting until the server can get to it, meal deliveries. i only mention it because i know some folks might be bothered by that. to be honest i like places that group serve. in my opinion it makes the service, and food temperature, better.   i found the staff here to be absolutely wonderful. they fawned all over us from the moment we walked in until the very end of the day when i went back in to use the bathroom. even after all the customers had left the restaurant and the staff were eating their lunch. they did not act put out that i returned after about 15 minutes. such nice people. they were very accommodating, nice, helpful, made good suggestion, were always smiling and very friendly.   all in all, i had a great afternoon with precious friends.</u_review>
<u_review>meh, maybe if i was a  big breakfast lover. for me bkfst is bkfst-- lol. this place is an experience though. total dive. the place is like from the 50's with the colors and tackiness of the decor. but hey that's what the three stars are for. i love diners being raised in long island. i really miss them. i have eaten here twice and both times something was wrong with the order, cleanliness, and/or service was very lacking. very slow, very crowded, and the food is just not that great to keep me coming back. they are also a cash only establishment which is highly inconvenient for me. i have to admit their menu is extensive and the dutch baby, awesomeness of that german pancake was to die for. the other stuff is just regular breakfast food, and nothing special at that. the first time i went i did not like their pancakes. they was dry and not that great. i am glad i got the dutch baby this time around. that thing was darn good!!!!! i just don't eat pancakes enough to make it worth coming back that often.</u_review>
<u_review>i am reviewing sunday brunch at wrights. lovely and outstanding ! james our server was a dear, the food was delish! i wish i had more room for all those wonderful desserts, very unique menu, veal stroganoff. vanilla bean soaked infused fruit salad with pineapple.  banana cream and caramel brule. the cold buffet included all the standards like shrimp, italian ham, caprese, muffins, scones, and breads. loved the zucchini bread.  the hot menu upgrade included lobster eggs benedict, lavender infused waffles, flapjacks, organic tortilla chicken. it was delightful! the resort is so beautiful. looks like a type of old school, european castle. the lobby  is gorgeous! parking is not that great here though. this was a lovely day treat!</u_review>
<b_review>seems like the ratings reflect the niceness of the owners and staff members versus the food.  they were very nice..  the chicken salad sandwich was a little heavy with the mayonnaise.  the italian sub was pretty decent, not overdone with dressing.  the italian beef was different than the style i'm used to (chicago style), but it wasn't bad especially with the au jus that came with it.  the bread used in all these sandwiches were pretty good.  i wish they had more toppings - i like to get jalapeno or banana peppers on my sandwiches.  seems like they have limited toppings that they would place on a given sub unless specially requested?  the sandwiches aren't bad and they're very nice people.  however, these are not $7 subs.</b_review>
<b_review>some friends took me here while i was in town from la. great sandwiches and from what i understand this is a family owned and operated business. i hear that their lasagna is good too. i'll have to try that next time for sure...  ps- the price is right here. in la i would have been stuck paying double for the cold cuts.</b_review>
<b_review>love this family owned italian deli.  they are the cooks and that staff, and they always remember your name, even when you have not been their in years.  love the photos of the senior classes from saguaro high school, definitely supports the locals.  get the chicken salad sandwich or the chicken steak, you will not be disappointed.</b_review>
<b_review>as the name says, it's a deli.  a hoagie shop.  and it blows the chains (subway, quiznos, etc) out of the water.  it's a family-owned place.  the staff is very friendly and nice, and go out of their way to be helpful.  they know several of their customers by name.  they have several kinds of hot and cold sandwiches, and you can customize them any way you like.  i had the "chicken steak", and had them melt provolone on it, and add marinara, onions and peppers.  the portions are large, and the price is quite reasonable.  oh...and they "import" cheesecake from nyc.  it's really good too.  don't let the simple decor fool you.  the chairs and tables are cheap, but the food is really good.  they do close early, so be warned.  3pm on sat, and 6pm mon-fri.  closed sun.  cash only.</b_review>

<text>i finally joined this gym after weeks of agonizing over the monthly rates. i was having a hard time justifying the approx $80/mos fee. turns out, i didn't have to stress that hard since i got a decent rate already being a gold's gym member in the north scottsdale gym. because i was already a member, my new rate was $50/mos and even though my husband was not a member, he got that rate, too. that might seem like alot but the hot yoga classes were a major factor for me. even though they only offer one hot yoga class per week, they will be increasing the frequency due to the popularity. so, in my opinion, i am getting unlimited hot yoga per month for an added $25 to my existing gym membership. way, way worth it to me when i factor in bikram yoga's rates. there are a number of features to this gym that other reviews have already mentioned. they have individual spinning bikes that have individual screens allowing you to use a digital spin instructor. this is great if you can't make it to their live spin classes. all of the cardio machines have tvs that you can plug your headphones in. the employees actively seek suggestions to add machines they don't already have. members are also offered a workout towel and shower towel so you don't have to bring one. i like the option of the validated parking (2 hours). if i want to go to an event downtown, i can fit in a short workout, shower, and then leave my car in the garage for whatever time i have left in the garage. i'm not sure how busy the gym will get after awhile, but for now, i am enjoying the easy and quick access to any of the machines. lots of people-watching and nice views are to be had working out by the windows...you can't beat it.</text>
<u_review>we attended this month's third friday n+u event (free) at the heard and it was a blast! this month, it was capoeira and african drumming/dancing with an open bar and margaritas/street tacos in the cafe. the event was entertaining, full of energy and my 3 year old and i danced for almost an hour. my margaritas certainly didn't hurt! i had a great time and i am really looking forward to september's event, jewelry and drinks!</u_review>
<u_review>generic soup, salad, sandwich place with lots of options. i picked a soup and half sandwich combo, with the turkey avocado panini and chicken tortilla soup. the sandwich looked so unappealing and didn't taste much better than that. the soup was decent. i liked the chocolate covered strawberry...wasn't expecting that. i think this is a good addition to the plaza, but i would rather go to the biltmore for paradise bakery.</u_review>
<u_review>we finally made it down here after hearing good things from the locals. we only stayed about an hour but i would defiitely love to go back. my friend and i had the $2 margarita special on fridays and when the server brought it out, i was like, maybe we didn't get the special (since the glass was so tall). but to my surprise, it was the special! a girl can get into alot of trouble with those yummy tall glasses of $2 goodness. since we were headed to a reverse happy hour, we split their $10 bruschetta plate. note, my husband orders it correctly to sound like: "brusketta" and the server corrects him, "oh, the brushetta"? funny but annoying, too. the bruschetta was extremely good with three pieces each of two kinds. when i go back, i am dying to try their white cheddar grits. their menu looked pretty good and we loved the decor. there was lots of different types of seating and the patio looked super cute. i can't wait to go back and get tanked on $2 margaritas...classy, i know.</u_review>
<u_review>i have stopped into copper star on previous occasions, during street festivals, but today was the first time i came to sit and study. man, am i a fan of this place. i am lucky that i live in a location where i have a multitude of options (lux, lola, hob nobs, sbux, etc) but i have to say i really liked the vibe here. the music wasn't loud, the people relatively quiet and chill, and i could actually focus on what i was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me. i liked that while on a busy street (7th ave), the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on. that added to the peace and quiet of it. employees were nice, free wi-fi (internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop), and i enjoyed my small, mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie (both just under $7). i was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie (which was soooo good if i might say). they are open until 9pm on sundays which is pretty cool. i have yet to use their drive through for coffee, but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to sbux. there is also outdoor seating which will be so nice when it starts to cool off....you can give your dog a bath at wag-n-wash next door and then sit outside with them while you enjoy some local coffee.</u_review>
<b_review>"$20 a month. no gimmicks, no contracts." great. where do i sign up? "oh yeah, there is a $49 sign up fee." ok. that's pretty standard for a gym. "ooooh, i forgot, there is a $39 annual fee." hmmm, ok, i'll still sign up (swipes card). where do i register for the spinning class? "about that, you don't have access to the group classes unless you upgrade your membership." goddamusomuch you didn't tell me that before i paid.  (edit) upgraded to three stars for reaching out and making it right. thank you.</b_review>
<b_review>popped in here while on a business trip - i am a member of a different golds gym.  very clean and nice - just like you would expect from a gold's gym.  was very crowded during the week at 5:30am.    the treadmills were upstairs in the main workout area.  some of them were broken - oh well it happens.  i had my run and had to hunt for the cleaner - there was just one for an entire bank of treadmills (not enough for every paper towel station).  the classroom is located downstairs and was having a class while i was there.    i would definitely come here again.</b_review>
<b_review>so we finally joined this local gold's gym. my wife was already a member so she just had to upgrade her account to be able to go to this elite location. what a dope gym!  they have all of the top-of-the-line equipment, a huge cardio cinema room where they play movies all day, nice sauna's and great city views. i was literally able to run a few miles on the running eliptical while overlooking the downtown traffic, how awesome is that????   everybody seemed very helpful and the clientele was your downtown workers, not the juice heads from scottsdale shore. they have an expanding class program with hot yoga, power yoga, pilates and spinning. woo hoo for the hot yoga, bikram is getting pricey for me!  what a gem, super stoked to have such a high caliber gym so close to the pad!!!!</b_review>
<b_review>i have been a member for just under one year now, and i have really zero complaints. i'm not sure what all the griping about the actual gym is about. there have definitely been times when you wait for machines or a bench, but if you go during rush hour you need to expect that. i have also not had any issues with my actual membership fees or contract. all of the staff has been exceedingly nice.  the machines and other equipment are new and up to date and are seldom under repair. most of the other members are respectful and there aren't any douche baggy meathead types. i have not taken them up on personal training, but i have overheard sessions in progress and all of them seem to be respectful and motivating.   i guess my one complaint, which isn't about the gym itself, is with some of the people who workout there. the benches are not meant for your personal belongings while you go and use some other machine or bench. also, i use my cellphone in there, but for the love of all things holy, don't sit on a machine and text away while other people are actually trying to get in a workout. end rant.  bottom line i have had a great experience and would recommend this gym to anyone.</b_review>

<text>walking into pcg on a recent sunday for brunch, i wasn't sure what to expect.  the place was pretty much empty.  coming off a few less than stellar recent brunch attempts at other local spots (why is it so hard to find good eggs benedict!?), i took this to be a less than favorable sign about the meal ahead...    well, i was wrong...  pcg served some of my favorite things!  a mimosa with fresh-squeezed oj started things off nicely.   :)   on to an appetizer - yes, even brunch deserves an appetizer!  i was happy to see jumbo bacon-wrapped shrimp on the menu.  now that wildfish no longer serves them, i have been hunting for a new favorite.  these were delicious - 4 large shrimp, stuffed with cojita cheese and wrapped in bacon - perfect with the accompanying chipotle-lime aioli.  and last, the main event.  the tenderloin eggs benedict was fantastic.  two english muffins graced with generous slices of medium-rare tenderloin, poached (not overdone - hooray!) eggs and tangy hollandaise.  this masterpiece came with diced breakfast potatoes (not greasy at all!) and a small bowl of fresh fruit.  yum!    thank you, pcg, for renewing my faith in brunch.</text>
<u_review>neither thrilling nor horrifying, a solid a-ok.   from the 'nothing over $20' menu to the wait staff who don't wear uniforms, culinary dropout is trying very hard to be unpretentious. located in a prime spot near the waterfront and fashion square, it ends up being a place where people want be seen.  look at meeeeeee!  the interior is a large dark open space. this is good for finding the people you are supposed to be meeting, but bad in that the acoustics are not the best. depending upon where you sit, even before the live music starts this place gets loud. very loud. huh? what? yeah, i said loud!   the menu contains an assortment of comfort food as well as some pretty creative sounding cocktails. feeling brave? you can even get a 'paper bag special' beer for $1.95 that could be pretty much anything.   our group of 8 started with appetizers:  soft pretzels & provolone fondue ($10) - these are puffy balls of soft pretzel bread served with a pot of cheese for dipping. while i love my cheese probably more than almost anything, this reminded me of melted american cheese slices. i think a spicier or sharper cheese would have been better.   house potato chips with famous onion dip ($6) - i love fresh potato chips but these were really, really greasy. the 'famous' dip (who decides that, by the way?) was just ok.   crusty bread with good olive oil ($2) - basically what it says - slices of bread with a small bowl of olive oil.   i had the roasted chicken salad, with sour apples, pistachio and dolce gorgonzola ($12). while this was fairly good, i should have asked for the dressing on the side. there was a lot in there. probably enough for two salads, so the lettuce quickly became squishy. the chicken portion was pretty small but i did enjoy the overall flavor of the crisp apples and crunchy pistachios and cheese.   our waiter was great, but the runner who brought out our food was clueless. she didn't seem to care that she was just putting items in front of the wrong person, and we all had to shift the dishes around ourselves to get to what we had ordered. she also carried the salad bowls with her thumb inside of them, touching the food! ick...   i think this place could be fun for drinks or happy hour (day-drinking, anyone, when it is cool enough for the patio??) but the food was just average.  i would rather wander next door to wildfish...</u_review>
<u_review>i am not happy with the co worker who introduced me to forefathers.  do i really need another way to feed my addiction to cheesy, beefy goodness?    of course i do!  this small restaurant in a tempe strip mall has earned a special place in my heart.  no, not just because of the artery-strengthening cheese.  it is home to the best cheesesteak i have experienced since moving to az.  while the menu offers a variety of choices other than cheesesteak sandwiches (chicken and even *gasp!* salads), i stick with what i know and love:  regular with cheez wiz ($7.35) - bring your appetite, because this sandwich is big!  a generous portion of thinly sliced meat and that oh so important cheez wiz is nestled within a soft bun.  it is gooey, drippy and messy.  perfect.  if wiz is not for you, it is also offered with white american cheese, provolone or mozzarella.  while i prefer mine with just the basic meat and cheese, you healthy types can also get any combination of 'omg' - onions, mushrooms and green peppers.  fries are a very nice compliment to the sandwich.  let's be honest here, fries are a very nice compliment to nearly anything.  forefathers' fries ($2.55) are hot, salty and crisp.  if you haven't gotten your fill of wiz on your sandwich, you can turn those fries into cheese fries ($2.95).  either way, be sure to grab a container of 'fry sauce' (i am guessing this is some blend of ketchup and mayo).  one taste and you will want to put this on everything.    lucky for me and my cholesterol level, this gem is nowhere near where i live.</u_review>
<u_review>is it a market with a dining area or a restaurant with a market?  does it really matter?  it is just plain good!!  if you are looking for a no frills spot, haji baba is for you!  the small dining area is on the right side of the market, with a few tables even spilling out into the market itself.  it gets very busy during lunchtime, so arrive early or be prepared for a wait.    while the menu offers a variety of choices, being a creature of habit, i typically stick with what i know and love - the gyro sandwich.  nice and simple - a hearty portion of gyro meat, cool lettuce, pickle, tomato and creamy tatziki enveloped in a large, soft pita.  all this goodness for $3.99.  yes, really $3.99.  i can never finish it, even though i really, really try.  i also like their hummus (served with warm soft pita it is a great appetizer to share) as well as the spanakopita.  actually, i have enjoyed everything i have tried.  so, you really can't go wrong.  the payment process is interesting - the waiter drops off a ticket stub at the table that you bring to the market register to pay.  if you are with a group, each person can pay separately by telling the cashier their items on the total ticket, which is nice.  and, if you happen to grab some of the tasty chocolate wafer cookies by the register to add to your bill, that is not a bad thing.  be sure to ask for some delicious baklava to go!</u_review>
<u_review>"ok, that kicked ass!"  this is the only sentence i could manage after leaving los reyes de la torta.  the food coma was quickly rendering me incoherent...  this place well, does kick ass.  ¡muy auténtico!  salsa music in the background and soccer on the tvs.  an extensive menu with portions that seem to only come in one size - ginormous.    we thought we were being so smart by sharing two items.  yeah, right.  there was enough deliciousness to feed a small family.  mango juice... served in a chalice with a big slice o' mango riding on the side.  shrimp quesadilla... i had no idea that tortillas could be made in that size.  torta del rey... easily more than 5" tall and packed with just about everyting that their kitchen can prepare.  i would love to see someone try to bite into this.  we had to eat it with a fork.  amusing that the torta is served with potato chips - who has the stomach real estate left to eat those!?  the only thing you can do after a meal like that is crash on the nearest couch until you feel human again.  i will be hungry again sometime late next week.  ¡ay, lo me encanta!</u_review>
<b_review>i had lunch here the other day and it was really pretty good, that 16th / bethany intersection is not lacking for good restaurants either!  i went with six other people and everybody really liked it.  smooth decor, decent service, and competently prepared food with a sw flair.  soup, sandwiches, salads, all were a hit!!  their brunch is the stuff of legends although i have yet to partake.</b_review>
<b_review>this place is a neighborhood staple. the menu is not my fav (my taste buds only). i sat at the bar waiting for a friend to show up. i think the bartender was new, not just because of the deer in the headlights look on his face, but also the fact that i had to wave him down after about 7 minutes of sitting there. there were 6 specials, 2 which caught my eye. after settling on one, we ordered and were told they were out of 4 of the 6 specials. might i add it was about 12:15pm. that seemed a little early to be running out of specials. the food we ordered ended up to be ok.   if you haven't eaten here, you must. if given the option i would pick 3.5 stars. this is because of the service and the lack of available specials (maybe cross them off the sandwich board out front when you run out?) i've heard they have a great happy hour and i would definitely recommend the bacon-wrapped shrimp on the app menu.</b_review>
<b_review>the food was ok, but the atmosphere and service was less than stellar. the median age of the diners, at 8pm no less, was about 60. the waiter left us alone after bringing drinks taking our order for what seemed like 30 minutes, before telling me that what i ordered was 86ed. that was all fine and good, but when i re-ordered the turkey sandwich, that's not what brought me. it was a chicken sandwich and was missing it's main condiment to boot. i got a side of whatever was supposed to go on it, but i didn't realize the it was chicken instead of turkey until later, and by then, it was so late and everyone else was practically done eating, so i let it go. overall, the food wasn't anything special and the service is definitely under-par</b_review>
<b_review>i loves the cool music and very clean bathrooms. the photographs on the wall are beautiful and add an interesting connection to our history.  the appetizers we ordered were fantastic. we had the griddle cakes and the spicy hummus appetizers ! hamburgers: the blue cheese and the pcg burger were delicious. the beef was excellent and the sauce was great! the pot roast with bourbon gravy was excellent. the portions were big and could easily be shared by two. the rib eye steak was large and very delicious. we also liked the flavorful mashed potatoes.  service was very good! i will be back soon !</b_review>

<text>just returned from a great first time at four peaks. after much debate on what to drink, i enjoyed a nice, cold pint of the 8th street ale, along with the southwest burger. both ended up being excellent choices. the beer was tasty, and the burger was one of the best i'd had in a long time (fries weren't too shabby as well). service was pretty quick for how crowded it was. nice establishment.</text>
<u_review>we decided to swing by joe's farm grill for lunch on a saturday, after seeing it featured on ddd. funny, it was literally down the street from where i used to live...i had driven by it many times, and never noticed it.  joe's is situated in a unique futuristic-like building, next to a little cafe/coffee shop on the same property. once inside joe's, we were able to order pretty quickly despite the crowd. i had bbq chicken pizza, which was fantastic! my fiance had one of their burgers, which i had a few bites of. both meals were very tasty, fresh, and light. although it was a little on the spendy side, it was worth it because everything was obviously fresh and healthier than your average eatery.  we really enjoyed our lunch and checking out the grounds, and i hate to complain, but i did have 2 questions. first, the restroom set-up was strange (only 1 restroom, in which you have to wait in line for outside), and you have to go outside to get drink refills...next to the lone restroom (which was strange to me). just a funky set-up. but otherwise, the visit was great, and we will be back for another meal and visit to their coffee shop.</u_review>
<u_review>yep, dan l. said it all...your standard dry cleaner. fast service, but i didn't get a smile from the girl behind the counter on either visit, or come to think of it anyone working there. at least my clothes were pressed nicely, and were back when they said they'd be ready. i'd go back since it's on my way home and it's the closest dry cleaner to my house.</u_review>
<u_review>found my new burger spot in chandler. bison burger, sweet potato fries, and fried green beans were superb. nothing like a good bison burger, good micro brews, and good music in the background. can't wait to hit it for happy hour. if you like a quality burger and chill atmosphere, i recommend you check it out.</u_review>
<u_review>my only complaint: they are inconsistently open on saturdays even though their hours on their building front say they are open saturdays 9 to 1. other than that they have been overall awesome.</u_review>
<b_review>i'm a new member to yelp as of today, woo hoo! so why not pop my yelp cherry with a review of the four peaks brewing company?   i have been a fan of four peaks for several years. upon arrival the hostess staff is always friendly and efficient. on a typical evening, waiting for only a few minutes is expected, the place has a laidback atmosphere, misters in summer and heaters in winter, ensure a proper climate controlled ambiance. outside or inside, everywhere is comfortable.  the food is great, with daily specials for entrees and soups, their menu is constantly pleasing and full. a wide array of mouth watering appetizers, entrees, and deserts, this place hits the spot almost everytime. that's not even scratching the surface when you start with their incredible selection of home draft brews, for the faint of stomach, to the bold hopp"ie", it only gets better when every half quarter they introduce a new seasonal, like the pumpkin porter. you have to act fast to experience these specialties, for they never last as long as you hope.  this place is great, with positive management, sharp staff, and intelligent ownership, i look forward to visiting this place for years to come.</b_review>
<b_review>my wife and visited four peaks for dinner this past saturday on a date night and it was out of this world.   the food was amazing the server was attentive without being annoying and the beer was perfect.  i tried the flight and really liked the hop knot and the 8th st.  (kiltlifter is already in my beer hall of fame club). my only complaint, open a resteraunt on the west side and save me from rock bottom and gordon biersch.</b_review>
<b_review>micro breweries are becoming a dime a dozen in the us. it seems like every city has their versions....this makes for a fun brew finding mission when i visit other cities. several conversations with friends recommended four peaks as the place "[i] will love it!". reading a dozen different yelp reviews the expectation grew...when we made the turn on 8th st. i felt lost for a moment before the gleam of light showed a well marked restaurant/brewery. the building is a converted warehouse....and they did a fantastic job converting it into a brewery.  if you have never been here before (and over 21) check out the beer sampler. 3oz sampler of each brew on their regular rotation! my favorites are the hefeweizen and the arizona peach. "the peach" as they call it is probably one of the more unique tastes in beers i have had the pleasure of tasting. the chicken nachos were awesome. most of the time when i have chicken on nachos the meat ends up slightly dry. in this case the chicken remained moist and flavorful. the fries were battered in some kind of awesome...like the seasoning was baked into it or something.   four peaks has a friendly and fast waitstaff. as confirmed, the ladies that make up the waitstaff are very attractive..maybe it startled me but it was refreshing to see such great personality (as we were cutting up a little and the waitress we had was fueling the fire with her playful comments...)  i was only here briefly for a light snack and a few drinks so i never got to fully experience this place. no question it was a great place that is very locally celebrated...something i personally appreciate. service was great, food was great, beer was awesome....these are the reasons for 5 stars  i will be coming back around here next time i am in town.</b_review>
<b_review>i hope i don't lose any friends over this review, i know everybody loves it!  and i don't mind it.  it is a-ok.  full disclosure: i'm not a fan of beer.  that fact will not affect my opinion of the establishment!    the food really is good.  i've never been disappointed, and there are items on the menu i haven't had a chance to try that i think i'll enjoy.  service has been so-so.  regardless of the level of busy-ness, i've seen a mixed bag of friendly, polite, personable servers, and stressed out, slow moving servers.  bathroom cleanliness is iffy, if you consider that sort of thing.   my beer-loving friends and boyfriend love four peaks for the local beer, and new seasonal options that always live up to the micro-brew reputation.  it is cool how knowledgeable all the staff are as to their beers and pairings, and several of them have even tried to recommend something new to me, hoping to convert me to beer-ism.    i don't think i've ever been here when it wasn't crowded.  i'd say that speaks equally to the quality of the beer and food, and to the susceptibleness of asu students who "have to go" to four peaks.  although, if i lived at asu or close by and could ride a bike or something, that would improve my opinion slightly as i could avoid fighting the good parking fight.  a little walking never killed anyone, but the parking situation here is a little out of control.    walk or carpool, try a new beer, pair it with an appetizer, and enjoy yourself.  i'll pop in once in a while :)</b_review>

<text>best fast food restaurant.  great service.  fresh food.  love the grilled cheese with grilled and raw onions and minimal sauce.  the fries are great when they are hot.  fresh brewed iced tea with fresh big chunks of lemon.  mmmm.... i could eat here everyday.</text>
<u_review>good but not overly cheap and the service was horrible.  servers were polite but couldn't answer questions about the menu or what the dishes we were served were.  we tried several rolls and i have to say my favorite was the simple avocado roll.  huge chunks of fresh avocado.  the mixed tempura i wouldn't order again... i was surprised by the monkey brains appetizer.  it wasn't what i expected.  it was basically a stuffed mushroom (stuffed with spicy tuna) breaded in tempura batter and deep fried.  i think my favorite thing of all was the lychee martini.  so strong and a wonderful flavor.    i think we will try this place again for the 1/2 price teppanyaki at happy hour.</u_review>
<u_review>love the stuff- wish it wasn't so darn expensive.  they also have a storytime for the kids.  i think that is neat.</u_review>
<u_review>i really really really wanted to love this place.  almost all asian customers.  the waitress was the nicest waitress i have ever encountered.    i had the eggplant and potatoes with jalapeno.  only i asked for just a tiny bit of jalapenos because i am a wimp.  the waitress misunderstood our discussion and substituted green pepper for the jalapeno and i don't like green pepper.  the food was super greasy and almost flavorless.  :(  won't be back.</u_review>
<u_review>first off, i don't eat donuts.  that said as a child i loved them.  now i have children and they love them.  it is so fun for them to stand in front of the case and look at all the donuts before picking the one they want to buy and eat.  this location was very clean and the gentleman who waited on us was friendly.  the kids said they enjoyed the donuts as much as they do at bosa donuts.  i do miss the hot and ready ones from az mills mall though.</u_review>
<b_review>first in-n-out burger experience. i'm a fan. the burgers are thin, which i really like. will definitely go here more often when i move out west.</b_review>
<b_review>delicious food. friendly and super speedy service. the only problem is the rude people who don't understand how a drive thru line works! lol!</b_review>
<b_review>price was right. cool concept but i like 5 guys better. what a burger is my favorite burger, guess you could say i'm old school. in and out was busy and had good service but as for the burger's. a lot of hype.</b_review>
<b_review>how can i not give this place five stars??! i love these burgers and fries! the employees are always friendly and fast! two thumbs waaaay up!</b_review>

<text>a few days after the abysmal experience i received an e-mail stating that some big shot was going to call me to discuss.  i have received no calls, nor will i.  if their management is as lackluster as their presentation and service, there will be no phone call.  its like they have given up.....</text>
<u_review>it is what it is. for what they do, they do it well.  seriously, this is better than the wretched old town or country harvest or whatever they are called.  the food here actually has flavor, not geriatric tasting like those other places.  if the economy is bad, you can't tell, this place was packed on a saturday night, for a moment i thought the national white trailer trash convention was in town, more toothless wonders than you can shake a stick at.  but with that aside, they had steak, fried chicken, coconut shrimp, mashed potatoes, and all the usual all you can eat stuff.  but the food did have flavor!!  our wait person checked on us about 5 times and i liked the hot oily rolls they give you.  pretty good service actually and they were well organized.  it is what it is, and for what they do they do well.  total cost: 2 people with soda each = $ 27.55</u_review>
<u_review>well, i was the friggin' duke but some d.b. drive-by check-iner took my duke-ness.  that's cool.....   needed an update.  i really like sun-up.  the food is quite good, the place is chill, and january the bar-tender/server is so quick witted and funny, its fun just to listen to her interact with customers.  i enjoy her sarcasm.    only thing is i wish they would update their menu a bit and i wish the beer was a tad colder.  but the food is definitely above average imo for a beer pub.  a killer  french dip would be nice.....note to owner*****  otherwise, this is our go to place.  hard to find an real brew pub in phoenix.  on a crisp cool winter night, its a cozy place.  on a hot summer's night its a cool place to hang.  they always have a seasonal beer and a dinner special.  gets busier i have noted than previously.    oh, and kettle chips, don't forget the kettle chips!!  dont forget the chipotle ketchup.  if the beer was colder, i would give 5 stars no doubt.  trooper ipa....just saying.  critical update alert 11/18/2012  after much soul searching, i have decided to deduct a star.  i love this place and i love the beer but:  i just have to be honest:  the beer is simply not cold enough.  i prefer an icy cold beer.  look, i know i'm not alone in this.  why is the beer so, well not cold really?  and another thing, the menu hasn't been updated since bush was in office, and i'm talking bush 1.  please make the beer icy cold, if i wanted warm beer i'd go to germany!!  this is phoenix man, wtf?</u_review>
<u_review>forget all about old town scottsdale and all the clone look alike hotties and the trendy night life.  what you need is old town sun city, where the blue hairs and the golf carts keep the party going 24/7!!  and if you want a slice of what it was like to live in 1975, then chang lee is your place!!  so when in sun city and you want to very average chinese food with furniture and people that smell like moth balls, then by all means hit this hot spot up.  forget fez, chang lee is where it is at!!</u_review>
<u_review>fast, cute, clean.  burger = decent, flame broiled.  fries = hot and fresh with seasoned salt on them.  soda = sucks, pepsi products.  staff = unfriendly teen female worker, hates her job, but loves her paycheck i am sure.    inside it is kind of like a poor man's five and dinner, with 50's nostalgia.  but it was clean.  won't go out of my way, but would go back for a quick burger and fries, certainly better than mcsatan's or lucifer in the box.</u_review>
<b_review>i would give this capital grille location no stars if possible. i don't mean to be harsh, but i expect a lot more out of restaurants that charge this much for their food. my mom, brother, boyfriend and i visited capital grille, mid-may, for an early birthday dinner for myself. we have never dined at a capital grille, but have been to the palm several times, as well as blt steak restaurant group. this was our first experience and last one. we wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. we were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. at one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. finally, he came to table with the wine. my brother and boyfriend started with the french onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. i started with the lobster bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. my mom had the spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. mediocre at best. we didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. the excuse we received was that this was the "corporate recipe", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? my brother ordered the dry aged porterhouse, my mom ordered the kona crusted dry aged bone in sirloin, and i ordered the delmonico. we also ordered their "signature" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the truffle fries. unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, i'm not sure if they were even serving prime that day. maybe a corporate decision? the gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? creamed spinach mediocre. the fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? the most disappointing and shocking moment is when ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the dry aged steak au poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. they gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. which i took one bite when i got home and threw it away. very disappointing when you spend this much money and receive this type of service and quality of food. we might as well set $500 on fire.</b_review>
<b_review>i've heard great things about the food but i was disappointed. we had a reservation, arrived on time but were not seated for 20 minutes. service was friendly and knowledgable but it took forever to get our entrees - about 45 minutes after our appetizer was finished and gone. i ordered steak oscar and i'm pretty sure they had grill running way too hot - my steak was crispified on the outside and rare on the inside. the desserts were the highlight of the meal and they had a good selection of wines by the glass. my first impression: overpriced and overrated.</b_review>
<b_review>not bad, but not my first choice for the area. the staff are friendly and the food is good, but it just feels too much like a man's club.  that being said, it is a great place for guys to go for dinner who are really looking for dinner. i think i need more... of something.</b_review>
<b_review>i see that someone finally updated the business hours! too late after showing up yesterday for a birthday lunch and discovering that the hours were not updated on most sites on the web.</b_review>

<text>even though it is 30 miles away, i will be coming back to tesoro often.  the osso bucco alone is worth it.  succulent veal bathed in a light brown sauce sitting on top of parmesan risotto.  and did i mention the bone marrow?  seriously amazing.  one of the top 3 things i've ever eaten.  the osso bucco alone should merit 5 stars, but the soup was boring and the mozzarella was slightly cold.</text>
<u_review>much better than the abomination that is outback.  better than firebirds.  not as good as ruth's chris or flemings.  great place for lunch as the burgers are great (although the fries are not good).  for dinner, it's ok.  the wedge salad is forgettable.  the crab stuffed mushrooms were pretty good, but a little too much cream cheese.  the sides (mashed potatoes for my wife and a loaded baked potato for myself) were ok.      the steak (bone in rib-eye for myself and a filet for my wife) were very flavorful.  although not prime cuts, the preparation was very nice.  i usually prefer broilered steak.  this was the first time i really enjoyed a fire grilled steak.  an added plus was that the rib eye actually was mostly eye.  a lot of places will give you a rib eye and the eye is as big as my thumb.  not here.   i appreciated that.</u_review>
<u_review>it is what it is.  overpriced, underwhelming food.  the burgers are ok.  the cheesecake is whipped (i.e., not good).    i can't believe i spent $70 here.  it makes me die a little to write that.  never again.</u_review>
<u_review>top notch shoe repair shop.  i had a pair of magnanni's re-soled and re-heeled and they feel brand new.  additionally, he totally cleaned up all of the little scuffs.  i had one small tear at a seam and now i can't tell that it ever existed.  very well priced.</u_review>
<u_review>decent chinese food, for phoenix.  the hot and sour soup was actually very good, but didn't have a lot of extras.  the pork fried noodles were flavorful.  the spicy fish fillet in spicy oil was very underwhelming.  i asked for it to be very spicy and i didn't even think about breaking a sweat.  the broth was also rather bland.   my three year old daughter loved the noodles, hence the 3 stars.</u_review>
<b_review>my favorite ristorante italiano outside of italy! my two fav reasons to come here is their gnocchi and lemoncello. their gnocchi is the best i have ever had. it it not too potaoey and doughy like alot of gnocchi. it basically melts in your mouth and is heavenly. the vodka sauce they put over it is just as good. tomato's, basil, cream and a ton of fresh cracked pepper which i love!  i order this dish ever time i go there because it is just that good. it's a great comfort food! they have alot of other great dishes like the eggplant parm. and of course the lasagna. i have heard that if you like tripe, its also very good here. me, i tend to stay away from guts!  they make their own lemoncello and i finish every meal with this yummy digestif. its not too strong and perfectly lemony. i love it!  i also love that this is a small quaint place. you def need reservations to get a table here since there are only like 15 tables here.  the friendly family that owns this place are from southern italy and they def know how to cook and run a great restaurant. this is the one restaurant i will miss when i leave scottsdale....</b_review>
<b_review>if i lived closer, i'd be there every week!  the shrimp diavolo is my absolute favorite!  tell filomena that campus flowers sent you!  they are usually pretty busy so call ahead to make a reservation.  desserts are awesome too.</b_review>
<b_review>a small family owned and run italian resturant.  great food, service and wines.  the menu is varied with daily specials.  the chef is dad & daughter, mother is the maitre' d, daughter and brother servers.  have been going there since it opened and have never been the least bit disapointed.  must call for reservations.  come and get spoiled. best in the valley! for me best in country!</b_review>
<b_review>if your looking for a great little italian place this is it.  food is top notch, the service is friendly and caring, and the prices are reasonable. all the pasta dishes we have had have been great as have been the veal dishes.  we have never been disappointed in any of their wine recommendations as well.  most of the times we have had to walk in we have been turned away so you should make a reservation first.</b_review>

<text>there happy hour is great!  1/2 off app's - everything on the app list is amazing - especially the shrimp and catfish taco's!  and they have the most amazing marg - it is made with chambord (sp?) and you are limited to only 3 b/c they are so damn strong!  wish the crowd was hipper - it seems to be a bunch of old folks - but that could be b/c we go some damn early!  service is always great - food is always good - and there berry cobler will rock your world!  i am going tonight and can't wait!</text>
<u_review>wow!  loved it!  the portions were a bit too small for the prices but the food was great.  hostess was especially friendly.    table side gac is amazing but again way too tiny - especially for 12.00.  the primarita marg was super yummy - but again, pricey!  i felt like i was back in los angeles with these prices! great parking as well!  the decor is beautiful and different for scottsdale.  great crowd. i felt like i wasn't in scottsdale.  it had an up north feel (think san francisco).  cool place.  this is by far my favorite place here in az - i bring all my out of town guests here and have many girls nights out - and date nights with my hubby. love that its dark and cozy - but hip at the same time. i have never had bad service or a bad meal - this place is great!  the owner brian is a doll, his sweet wife works there too - wonderful, wonderful wonderful!</u_review>
<u_review>this shop is great! they are fast, know their stuff and have helped me with everything from a custom piece, to repairing my favorite super delicate necklace.  i can't say enough good things.  location is super easy as well - i park at sears at pv mall and walk right through and the shop is right there.  great staff - great work - so glad i found them!</u_review>
<u_review>the hubby loves beer - i mean loves it - so i decided to surprise him by taking him to fpbc in tempe - we had the little guy with us (as usual - i mean that in a good way). we pull right up front - rock star parking!  i see the misting systems going - and people hanging around the front.  beforehand, we had a little trouble finding it so stopped at a house to ask for directions.  there was a happy hour house party going on - about 10 - 20 somethings hanging in the front yard playing ping pong & bbq'ing - looking like a beer ad for a commerical - we asked about fpbc & the guys were very happy to help us with the directions and said cool spot you will like it!  i say to my hubby, see this is why i love tempe, are you sure you don't want to sell the house in pv and move here!?!  hmmmm....  so we find it, my first thought was ok, part the bwm around the corner so we blend in!  then i thought nah, lets just go!  the first thing i noticed was a sign that read "no minors" so i have the hubby wait in the car and ask the very hip, very alternative looking door guy if we can bring our baby in & he says sure just don't try and slip him a drink!  i thought i like this place already!  we sat outside as it was a bit too loud inside (for the little guy).  as well, that scene in sweet home alabama played in my head about the girl in a bar with a baby!  so we sat outside - thinking that would be better? hee hee...  mind you i hate beer but played along, so i ordered the lightest beer on the menu it was a peach ale - yummy!  the hubby ordered three weird tasting beers and loved each one.  we had the chicken rolls which we amazing and the shrimp bruchetta (sp?) they use way too much garlic but it was still good and a great portion size.  we will go back for sure, but i think we will leave the baby at home - so we can really enjoy the noise :)</u_review>
<u_review>loved this place!  very hip scene - packed bar - great food!  there drinks weren't poured very heavy as the bar is managed tighly with over head cameras or so the waiter said! i loved the decor!  very la!  it aint cheap!  but its fun and cool!</u_review>
<b_review>those tostada shrimp bites were delicious, i wasn't excited about paying for chips & salsa. it is a great hh spot but the dinner menu was underwhelming</b_review>
<b_review>really great tex-mex! the outside seating was very nice and relaxing.  there's a lot to do in this area.  when back in phoenix i will be looking this place up.</b_review>
<b_review>never used to be a fan of this place...apparently they've changed their menu in the past few years, or my taste buds have matured past grilled cheese and pbj, which is a high possibility.  my hubby and i stopped by for lunch/brunch once and again a few weeks later for a late lunch.  i honestly can't remember what we ate for brunch/lunch but i know it was good (quite a bit of food though - recommend sharing if you can or doggie bag it).  the staff is all very friendly and welcoming as well.  for the late lunch we split the chile pork verde.  it was very very good (in love with renegade's green chili pork stew though.)  we also split leo's street tacos.  both of these were very filling and absolutely amazing.  the salsa/sauce that accompanied these dishes had so much flavor - in fact all the ingredients had flavor.  these two dishes combined with the corn bread...too much good stuff!  there were more items we would like to try so we will def be back.  for dessert, we found out the apps were 1/2 price due to happy hour.  what a sweet treat.</b_review>
<b_review>the frozen strawberry margaritas are strong and yummy, just how i like them!  after roaming around mill ave., my friend suggested coming over to z'tejas because she used to work here. i let her do the ordering since i'm sure she knew all the good stuff. we started off with strawberry margaritas and they are really good! it's a great way to get your buzz going since they're strong too. as for appetizers, we got the tejas trio, cast iron skillet dumplings, and the grilled shrimp & guacamole tostada bites.   the tejas trio was basically your chips and salsa, except it came with guacamole, chile con queso with chorizo and salsa picante. the cast iron skillet dumplings were spicy shrimp and pork, wrapped in wontons, steamed and seared, served with a sweet ginger soy dipping sauce. these were really good, i loved the sauce that was drizzled over it. the grilled shrimp & guacamole tostada bites were tiny little tostada rounds topped with fresh guacamole with marinated grilled shrimp on top. everything at our table was pretty good and i enjoyed it all even though we only ordered drinks and appetizers.   even though z'tejas is located in college town, the crowd in here was a little bit older. i'd say it was mostly people in their twenties or thirties. it's a pretty big restaurant and it looks like a great place to drink and hang out if you want to get away from the typical college crowd. i think they have great happy hour specials as well.</b_review>

<text>i'll probably be stoned to death and lose my pink card for this review, but i've given bliss a chance three times and was sorely disappointed all three. from inconsistent service, to snooze-inducing food choices, i just can't go into the rapturous food orgasms that many of my locals seem to have when eating here.  i haven't done the rebar side of the combo, so all i can speak of is the restaurant. i like the space, and sure the staff is cute (in a sort of frat-boy/porn star way), but i need good food with my eye candy.  things i have tried: 1) the chicken soft tacos -- no flavor and heavy on the purple cabbage. 2) loaded mac n cheese -- i prefer the mac n cheese at switch, hands down. 3) buffalo chicken sandwich -- decent taste, but a total mess to eat.</text>
<u_review>the sunrise sampler, no need to look anywhere else on the menu.  two eggs, bacon, sausage, and ham, hashbrown casserole, biscuits and gravy, grits, and fried apples. and it is only $7.99 for all that food. if you don't want one of the items, you can get more of another. i usually skip the grits and apples and go for double casserole and double biscuits and gravy.  it is seriously filling and completely tasty.  and healthy too! lol.</u_review>
<u_review>the new leaner breakfast sandwiches are good (they basically take the bottom and top of the bagel and you are left with smaller ends of your sandwich). an easy way to cut calories without losing the taste.</u_review>
<u_review>i have to update my review based on two recent visits. a friend and i have birthdays within two days of each other, and they won't let us both use the birthday coupons at the same time. annoying, but allowable. we decided to go twice and just split the bill both times.  the first visit, as a standalone, would have been a two star review. i ordered the blue cheese fillet. the "blue cheese" was some unappetizing whipped butter with a slight taste of blue cheese that was very disappointing. i'm used to steak houses that have tasty blue cheese crumbles on the steak, not a whipped concoction. their french onion soup is very good though. the waiter on this night was very phony and icky-sweet and would be better suited to sell insurance instead of work at a restaurant.  we weren't really looking forward to the second visit, but decided to give it a second chance and not order the same thing. it would have scored a four star review on the visit last night. i ordered the peppercorn steak which had a tangy mushroom sauce on top along with lots and lots of peppercorns. twice baked potato was great as well. i ordered a side of creamy horseradish for the steak. we had the tempura snap peas & asparagus for an appetizer which were an odd choice for a steak house, but were very good nonetheless. our waitress was attentive, fun, and knowledgeable. just what you want.   will i go back? next year for the birthday meal for sure, but otherwise is a tossup. the keg kind of falls in the middle ground of steak restaurants. i love lone star for a casual steak and if i want a great date-night or special event steak, i will always go to either durant's or fleming's. the keg is conveniently located to me, so there is that possibility.</u_review>
<u_review>everyone seems to love it here. i can't help but find it a bit too full of itself for it's own good. the food is always good, the drinks are fine. i just feel like i'm an extra in an episode of a-list scottsdale or real houswives of scottsdale whenever i eat there.  i did love the christmas tree this year though.</u_review>
<b_review>went to the bar for a nightcap and was utterly unimpressed -- no creativity by the bartender, basically just threw red bull in with some vodka and watermelon juice and called it something i won't repeat here.  i haven't tried the kitchen here, but the outdoor bar is thinly stocked with the standards and shows no signs of imagination. at least nine|05 had a dj - on my visit they were just pumping satellite radio.  for now, save your time. there are better places to go in the area.</b_review>
<b_review>we've eaten here twice.  both on weekend, one for breakfast, one for lunch.  setting is great.  nice atmosphere.    service is fair.  friendly, but not overly attentive.  food is just okay.    here is the great thing about them for breakfast/lunch.  the $10 mimosa special is an entire bottle of champagne with a large caraffe of orange juice.  enough to get 3-4 people tipsy over breakfast.  $4 bloody mary was decent.  mac & cheese is tasty but nothing gourmet about it.   chicken sandwhich with bacon was just okay.  pretzel bun best part.  eggs are okay on the breakfast platter as well.  fries with grated parmesan cheese and red sauce dip is okay, but nothing special.  after two times, with all of the fantastic places to eat downtown, i probably won't be back.  seems like it's a better place to go to visit the bar than the restaurant.  when busy, with outdoor, it would be a terrific venue.</b_review>
<b_review>a new player in the downtown phoenix food scene, bliss is a creation by the folks behind the fez, switch, and ticoz empire. they occupy a buliding once occupied by fate and nine|05, the former of which was one of my favorite restaurants.  entering the restaurant, we were greeted with an odor of mildew and dirty water, which isn't exactly a pleasant way to arrive into an establishment. being the only ones seated in the small space, we were able to really examine it, and i noticed one glaring difference between the way they have it set up and the way it was set up; it feels like a cafeteria. the installation of florescent lights, heat lamps, and massive amounts of stainless steel in the open kitchen make this place feel like a lunchroom at high school. whatever, we can deal with it. an overview of the menu showed several options which seemed like drunk food... fried everything, cheese crisps, foot long hot dogs, slider burgers, tacos, grilled cheese, etc. apparently "comfort food" means deap fried grease? no thanks. i ordered the braised beef tacos, which had the consistency of paste, but were average in taste.   my biggest gripe with this place is the microwave (not even a turbo chef) sitting front and center in the kitchen. look, i understand that some restaurants use microwaves (usually not good ones) in their kitchen, especially if it's a cold kitchen (which this isn't) but having it in plain view and audible in the dining room is just atrocious. i truly hope someone from the restaurant reads this and hides the thing. it made me completely lose my appetite when i saw them heating my girlfriend's rice for her chicken skewers in the microwave. yuck. she did mention she was neutral about her food. we are people who go out at least once a day for a meal and try a new place every time, so we know food.   everyone we encountered was nice, and the service was very friendly. everyone seemed interested in how well we enjoyed our meal, the space, and they seemed interested in welcoming us back. unfortunately, the place looks kind of makeshift on the rebar side, and like a cafeteria on the bliss side. i'm not really sure why it looks makeshift, perhaps it is just because it looks like a temporary wall in the back of the room, or because it looks so bare, but it looks like they are in there just for the time being.   i feel compelled to go here again but only for drinks out on the patio. the inside looks like mexico, the food wasn't very good, and the cafeteria/microwave issues pretty much summed up this is not a place for a nice night out dining.  i also find it interesting how many reviews are by orange heads or people who were here for the "vip opening." c'mon, try the place before you write a public review of it, and by try i mean eat some food, and actually experience it.</b_review>
<b_review>what a sweet place. i really enjoyed our visit and hope it picks up steam. i loved the menu which includes comfort items like a grilled cheese sandwich and mac and cheese. both are served just quirky enough to be interesting but not enough to change the "comfort" part.   they serve orders of french fries three different ways. i tried the parmesan french fries which were served with a marinara-like sauce. i wasn't fan of dipping my french fries in a tomato-base. but i admire that they mix up a traditional serving of french fries.   the atmosphere was fun with a large outdoor patio, an exposed brick exterior, and fun pop music (i.e. our table was singing along to journey's "don't stop believing'").   this will be a favorite of ours during the winter months of phoenix. there's also plenty of room for group happy hours. the central-phoenix location is convenient!   give it a try!!!</b_review>

<text>i've been wanting to try tuck shop for a while now and finally got the chance when my husband and i went there for dinner last weekend. unfortunately, they did not live up to my expectations. i liked the vibe of the place but i wouldn't really say it was as homey as people make it out to be. for example, i liked the mismatched wooden chairs but they should have put some cushions on them to make it more comfortable. you know the cloth padded kind that you tie onto the wood spindles on the back of the chair? just a suggestion. and it was pretty loud in there. they need some rugs or something to soften it up help with the noise level. the staff was friendly but it felt more like i was in a trendy bar rather than a restaurant famous for homestyle comfort food.  of course the most important thing is the food and on that score only one out of the three dishes was a winner. i ordered the pork tenderloin. this was suggested by our waitress as one of the best things on their menu and boy was she right. the pork was fully cooked but still juicy and tender. and there was a lot of it. even better was the sauce... sweet and fruity but not too syrupy. the menu said it was a ponzu sauce but it didn't have that umami flavor (which is good since i don't think that would go with pork). and i really enjoyed the spinach that was sautéed with green apples. you wouldn't think those two things would go together but all the flavors on the plate really married up beautifully. hubby got the special which was a ribeye. normally that is one of his favorite steaks but this one was pretty fatty and just didn't have a good flavor to the beef. he also didn't really care for the seasonings. and the only other thing on the plate was some sautéed onions, in spite of the fact that it was almost $30. we decided to order some dessert and went with the chocolate chip cheesecake. this was a mistake. it was pretty unappealing when it arrived looking sort of gelatinous and wiggly. it was served warm (like warmer than room temperature) but yet it didn't seem to be an ny style cheesecake that had been baked. actually what it tasted like was just butter and sugar whipped together and had started to melt. the crust was made from shortbread cookies rather than grahams and had a coconut taste to it that was very off-putting as well. even the "chocolate ganache" topping that the waitress had described to us was too thin and watery and tasted suspiciously like hershey's syrup. i can honestly say that it was the worst cheesecake i have ever eaten and that is including frozen store bought.  i might give them another chance at some point in the future but i just wasn't wowed by the food the way the other reviewers seem to be. sorry tuck shop.</text>
<u_review>i am not sure why i had never been to this sauce before since it is fairly close to my home. but i went there a couple weeks ago with my sisters and it was a-ok. i am not a huge fan of their pizza but i do like their pasta and salads. i've eaten lunch a few times at the one in scottsdale which i think is ridiculously slow but this ocotillo location seems to have great service. i have a feeling i will return.</u_review>
<u_review>a couple weeks ago, the az republic had a story in their wed. food section about dim sum restaurants in phoenix. they mentioned china king and so my hubby and i decided to give it a try this sunday. i am certainly not an expert on authentic chinese food but i didn't really care for this place  when we got there, the only thing they had on the cart was beef tripe. we tried it and i thought it had a good flavor but after that we were left just sitting there waiting. the owner? came by and was very nice and asked if there was anything else we wanted. he gave us a menu of their dim sum items and so i picked a couple and then they were brought out to us. i really don't know the names of things so to me usually the fun of it is looking at the items on the cart and just pointing to stuff that looks good. the place was pretty empty so maybe they just didn't want to make all the items and put them on the cart in case they didn't get eaten. they did have a couple more items on there the next time she came around.   the place itself is pretty run down looking. they actually put a large sign on the door to let people know they are open since the front entrance is in such disrepair that the place looks closed. inside the carpet is very worn and dirty. they have chair covers other decor to try to fancy it up but the table tops were not too clean and overall the place just looked like it needed a thorough cleaning.  and as karen w. mentioned, it was just a little to warm in there to eat comfortably.  i think i will stick to phoenix palace and c-fu on the rare occasions that i do get a craving for dim sum.  those places are a lot nicer looking and i think have better food even if they do charge a little more.  the only thing that kept this place from one star is that we both stuffed ourselves for less than $15.  http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/dining/articles/2011/07/25/20110725phoenix-dim-sum.html</u_review>
<u_review>this hotel has a sleek, modern design with a touch of whimsy.  i really like the lighting in the main lobby area; it's very cool.  they also have an outdoor patio that is covered with white shade sails and had fake grass (the nice kind) which gave it a clean, crisp feeling.  i was there for a conference and that is where they served us lunch but i also think it would be a great place for an evening cocktail party or somewhere just to hang out and read during the day.  i am not sure how they have it set up when there is not an event but i noticed some white benches with the same fake grass on the seats (hilarious) pushed off to the side so i am guessing that is what is normally in the space.  i can't really comment on the rooms since i didn't spend the night there but the facilities in the conference space were pretty good.  very functional but not boring.  the food was decent too and the servers were all really friendly and on top of everything. overall i really enjoyed my day there.  reading the other reviews i guess i am in the minority since i came here for work and not to party.  i don't normally come to scottsdale for my weekend fun but i will give this place a try sometime.</u_review>
<u_review>i've been here a few more times and i always love the food.  everything i've had from the breakfast menu has been fantastic!  drinks are good, too, and its a great place for happy hour.  the deal on wine on sundays is still my favorite thing about this place.  they have sunday ticket so they always have two games on but they keep the sound off (closed caption) so it doesn't get too sports bar-y.</u_review>
<b_review>the only thing i would add to the many reviews is that i recommend you study the menu on the restaurant's website prior to going so you understand that this menu is limited and different.  our group of three had some difficulty figuring out what to order.  i think the idea here is for you to order as a group and share, which can be fun, if you are in to that.    we didn't like the mac and cheese with lobster very much.  it's a different twist on this old standby.  we were surprised at the very little piece of lobster you get for an extra $4.  it's not worth the extra money.  other than these quibbles it was good food and a nice, but small place.  they only take reservations for groups of six or more.</b_review>
<b_review>gotta love a place that has grandma goldie's clock & old school chairs as part of the decor!  we started with tomato casserole (heaven on a plate) & shreiner's stuffed dates. not really hungry anymore - had to try the duet: stuffed portobello & red pepper as well as the handcakes with kale & romanesco sauce (empanada-ish)!  yumm!!!  definitely a place to revisit & enjoy small plates. they care deeply about their wine & was much appreciated!</b_review>
<b_review>i've been to tuck shop about ten times now, and there is still no vegetarian entree.  perhaps worse is that their best small plate, the roasted baby beets, has been removed from the menu because of exorbitant market prices for local beets.  still a 4-star experience because of the delicious cocktails, perfect reading room, and best front of the house in town, john.</b_review>
<b_review>we've been wanting to hit up tuck shop for quite some time now, and i was pleased that we finally did. it's hidden away in south phoenix on oak, in an unassuming neighborhood. very quaint, and cute, just an overall warm, friendly vibe. we had about a 30 minute wait for our own table, and we enjoyed some riesling and red zinfandel while we waited in the "reading room". the staff was friendly, but not overly intrusive, and very efficient. we started with medjool dates with chorizo served over a bed of arugula (great, fresh, and hearty flavors), and the parsnip and potato fries with mushroom gravy (this was the only dish on the bland side). our main courses were split between the two of us, and included the times mac n cheese with lobster (incredibly delicious, topped with fresh, tender lobster meat), and the citrus brined fried chicken with white cheddar waffles (the waffles were fantastic, as was the flavor of the chicken, i just was a bit disappointed with the veiny, dark purple splotches throughout my thigh piece, but the breast and drums were perfect). overall, we enjoyed our experience, thought the menu was well thought out, not too large, and pricing was fair, and will be back again to try the lobster etouffee.</b_review>

<text>went here for reverse happy hour with some friends.  never been a huge fan of ra considering i feel there are other better sushi restaurants around, but the majority wanted to go here so i went.  definitely good happy hour prices but still not all that great.  i ordered for the hubby and i:  the chicken wings, tootsie maki roll, ra-ukin shrimp and korean bbq short ribs.    i honestly don't have a lot to say about this place because there is nothing sticking out of my mind.  for all of that, my bill came to $33 including an 18% gratuity.</text>
<u_review>ahhh if only this place was closer to my house! i love it!  i usually come and order the kalbi and a bowl of duk mandu soup.  but this time i decided to order the dolsot bibimbap which is basically a korean version of fried rice in a stone hot pot. i usually let it sit for a while so the bottom of my rice gets crunchy.  this is true comfort food.    the lady (assuming the owner) is very friendly and will help you with any questions you have.  the only odd thing was that my son wanted to drink an iced tea and she gave me a confused look and questioned how a little boy would like an iced tea.  weird.    they also state they are open until 2 am every night, but the hubs came one night at 1 am with his buddies and they were closed - it must have been a slow night.</u_review>
<u_review>this place was so disappointing.  maybe they are known for their sushi, but since we were there for noodles, we didn't order sushi.  unfortunately, their udon dish that they used to have in a broth was no longer on the menu.  our server barely spoke english so we had a language barrier and she kept insisting we order their udon dish that was stir fried.  instead i ordered their garlic chicken dish with rice.  the chicken was old and you could tell it had been flash fried quite a few times.  it was rough and wouldn't even tear apart when i was trying to cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  i couldn't even finish my dish.  the husband had these pork cutlets that he said was way too sweet and extremely dry.  he, too, had a hard time cutting his pork.  we ordered our son the udon stir fry and he ate about 4 bites and said he was "full".  so about $50 later, we left hungry and irritated and swearing we'd never come back here again.  so sad.</u_review>
<u_review>i've been coming to viet kitchen as long as it first opened. i don't like to write novels, so here's the gist of it.  their egg rolls are pretty darn good.  fried and crisp to perfection.  their bun cha gio thit nuong is also really good and very refreshing for a hot day.  their pho tai gan sach is good, also. not really a dish on the menu, but definitely not something hard for them to put together.   their service is pretty awesome.  considering most asian restaurants have rude staff that don't speak english very well, this establishment has very friendly people working here.  they'll answer any questions you have and actually come back to check on you and refill your drinks without you having to ask.</u_review>
<u_review>i like north because the food there is consistently good.  the service on the other hand is a hit or miss.  ate dinner there with the hubs and toddler the other day.  we ordered the burrata and the zucca chips for appetizers.  the zucca chips were delish, as always.  the burrata was  not all that great.  but that's okay - i wanted to try it and i did.  i ordered the atlantic salmon which was perfectly cooked and tasted delicious with the butternut squash.  hubs had the pork tenderloin which was medium rare and cooked to perfection.  i just love the food here.   service was a bit off for us tonight.  drinks were not refilled.  visits to see how we were doing were not very frequent, if at all.  we used a $100 gift card to pay for our meal which came out to $95 and some change.  we also gave her a $20 bill in cash and asked for $5 back - giving her a $15 tip. i was expecting to get my gift card back since there were a few dollars on there but it never came back.  when leaving, i asked if i was going to get my card back but she went on to tell me that she took my balance of my gift card and used it as tip towards herself on top of the $15 that i already gave her.  normally, i wouldn't mind giving a 20% tip but it was not deserved.  and one thing that irks me to no end is when a server assumes that we don't need change back.  that alone made me irritated.    please tell your servers not to ask if they need change back and don't assume it, either! i overheard another server at the table next to me asking if they needed change back and they said yes!! it's rude!!!</u_review>
<b_review>happy hour 4pm-7pm is the perfect time to dine at ra for sushi. should you decide to dine at ra.  3 gals with an alcoholic bev and enough rolls to roll us home and the total bill was $41 and change.  this was a nice bargain.  but.... the 2 stars state it perfectly "meh. i've experienced better."  that pretty much says it all.  the sushi was okay.  nothing special that makes me want to go back, so i probably won't unless i am shopping in kierland and must eat a sushi roll but that probably won't happen.   service was good.  it was that blah sushi. 2 stars.  with plenty of good sushi in town, they gotta step it up.  do you think they do better sushi before or after happy hour like are they thinking "ha, it's happy hour and that cheap-skate wants good sushi?!  ha ha ha"-- i don't know.  but i'm sticking to my other sushi hot spots.</b_review>
<b_review>i don't know what happened to this spot, atmosphere is still great, but i was there for lunch a few days ago, ordered vegas roll + spicy tuna & they were both terrible..literally my friend and i had maybe 1 or 2 rolls each..bland, no taste & stale..hard to find good sushi in this town these days..</b_review>
<b_review>hmmm sushi in scottsdale, arizona...  the goods - there is usually little wait, the music is good, and the sunday specials rock my sox.  the staff is usually attentive and down to earth, and the food usually comes out pretty quick.  it is hard to find a good mojito in this darn town let alone anywhere, and they make a mean mango mojito.  the crazy monkey roll is my absolute favorite with a lot of flavor, but its definitely an acquired taste (if you are a nigiri lover, this is probably not the one for you).  they are open late night too which is great and hard to find in the n snottsdale area.  the bads - they are not always consistent with their fish.  sometimes its great, other times it absolutely blows --- the nigiri is a toss up.  a seasoned sushi-er knows when something is not right; i put a piece of nigiri in my mouth that tasted way off, and what do you know it came right back up about 10 minutes later. normally, i would swear to never return to a place that caused unnatural regurgitation, but the manager was quick to rectify the situation, covering our food on our bill and offering us a voucher for a free dinner of whatever we wanted next time we came back in [this however did not go as planned - check out my review on the ra downtown] another time i found a bone in my salmon nigiri, definitely not ok.  the scene here too is simply obnoxious at certain hours, not as bad at this location though than others.    its worth a try, and i do still dine here, but your money is only worth it during the happy hour specials.</b_review>
<b_review>i was with a mixed group of sushi lovers and sushi newbies.  ra was a great choice to cater to all.    atmosphere was loud and lively.  the restaurant was very dark - could barely make out the menus.  lots of outside seating as well.  the place was packed but luckily we managed to snag a table.    we ordered family style, including spicy tuna rolls, seaweed salad, the viva las vegas, soft-shell crab rolls, tempura, chicken teriyaki, and a few other things that i can't remember.  even the sushi newbies loved all the sushi items!  they were also turned on to asahi.    our waitress graciously split the bill evenly 7 ways with 7 credit cards and no attitude.  total came to about $27 each, which was a very reasonable price.      would come back next time i'm in town.....</b_review>

<text>comfortably, friendly, inexpensive, delicious, welcoming, spicy, filling, clean, homey, loving, cute, fresh, fast, institution, reliable, familiar, guacamole, beans, sopas, salsa, and flan.  i love this place!</text>
<u_review>3 way burrito ($3.25).. not only is the name a whole lot of fun but it tastes awesome! red chile, green chile and beans wrapped in one of their killer tortillas.. smooth, tender, creamy and delicious. make it a foot long ($.90)and now were talking! pair it up with their salsa and you're in for some great mexican goodness!  i mentioned the tortillas but i really need to mention them again, they are fucking kick ass! stretchy while tender with a slightly smokey char taste, this is about as perfect as a tortilla can get. because they were so messed up with our order the manager gave us a free dozen.. they were just made too, hot and steamy in the plastic bag. i couldn't wait and ate one immediately.. my gawd, great mexican experience.   i love you carolina, will you marry me?</u_review>
<u_review>dating back hundreds of years, the cornish pasty comes from humble beginnings. the half moon shaped baked pastry filled with meat and vegetables was designed as a lunch for soot-covered cornish tin miners. to eat it, miners would hold the pasty at the crimped edge, and then discard that part after eating the rest of the pasty. this way the miners didn't eat the dirt they were covered in, missing out on ingesting stuff like arsenic that was common in the mines. while most tin mining is gone, we're fortunate to have the cornish pasty co., which specializes in pasties.  with restaurants in tempe and mesa, each location has its own spirit. while both are laid back, the tempe location has a more subdued feel with dim lighting and no windows. mesa has a brighter interior with indie rock blaring over the sound system.  if you enjoy watching kitchen action, belly up to the bar at either locale for a first-hand look into the hard work that goes into making their delicious pasties.  as soon as i entered the tempe location, the warm smell of wine gravy and fresh baked crust covered me like a blanket of mouth-watering comfort. the feeling was like going home for the holidays. i know it's a million degrees outside, but the feeling transcends the summer heat.  the first pasty i tried, the pilgrim ($8), exemplified everything that tastes good at thanksgiving, luscious turkey breast, sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions all wrapped in a tender crust, then served with a side of cranberry sauce. after one bite, i felt like i needed to pay thanks to someone.  the porky ($7) is filled with all that is good: pork, apples, potatoes, onions and sage and served with a side of red wine gravy. the problem with the gravy is that it's so tasty i'm not sure whether to dunk my pasty into it or drink it.  never able to resist a good burger, i decided to take a chance with the royale with cheese ($7.50). ordered medium, this pasty was brimming with a juicy hamburger, french fries and cheese and served with a side of thousand island dressing. as the meat juices ran down my face, i couldn't help but think of the scene in pulp fiction where john travolta explains to samuel jackson what the name of a quarter pounder with cheese is in amsterdam.  the peanut butter and jelly ($5) was served piping hot. one bite of this was not going to be enough. filled with creamy peanut butter, raspberry preserves and sliced banana, the sweet goodness oozed out after the first cut was made. the plate was expertly cleaned in mere moments.  cornish pasty co. has a small, but great, beer selection, including one of my favorites, kronenbourg 1664. plus visit during their daily happy hour from 3-5pm and you'll enjoy a buck off of every pint.</u_review>
<u_review>this place was so bad on so many levels i'm not even sure where to begin. our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. you know how needy i can get and need to be listened too and heard. we started by ordering the baked spinach and artichoke dip..  what i couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. this thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?  so i ordered their famous bbq ribs.. i hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. i happily ate my creamed spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. when the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if i was full. i told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if i wanted dessert.   over all i would never come back to don and charlie's.. aside from the  creamed spinach, which i can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. a shame too because it's so close to the house. i don't get it because the yelps are so good. maybe they were having  a bad night? it was so bad i wouldn't ever go back to find out.</u_review>
<u_review>if you're on twitter you'll see so many different places you can follow. its cool to because they announce deals and such that are coming soon. for instance, coup des tartes tweeted that they would be running the yelp eats menu this past friday and saturday. i was super excited because the night i was supposed to go there was a family emergency and i had to cancel. anyway, once we arrived we were given the standard menu so we asked about the yelp eats menu, "oh yeah sure". what was brought back was not the yelp eats menu but some 3 course prix fix menu for $25 that didn't even have one yelp eats item on it. no onion tart, no lamb shank etc.. very disappointing and irritating. do not call a ferrari a corvette, no matter how you slice it, they aren't the same thing.   anyway.. ended up ordering the pate and onion tart appetizers. the pate is not house made and tasted like liverwurst, the onion tart was very good. however, once we learned that there was no wine service and a (correction, not $12) $9 corkage fee, that was the nail in the coffin, we were out the door.   at the end of the day they falsely tweeted to get customers in the door then try to pass off something that isn't. very misleading, the classic bait and switch apparently still works.</u_review>
<b_review>really bad mexican food. i give it 2 stars only because of the cheap price. tacos were awful. coming from san diego this food was really bad. avoid.</b_review>
<b_review>this is a cute little family restaurant located right in the middle of the downtown mill ave strip.  there food isn't the best i've had, but isn't bad either.  if you are on mill and want sitdown mexican food then come here i guess...  might go again sometime but i am in no hurry.</b_review>
<b_review>i love this place. the enchiladas in green tomatillo are superb, the tomatillo is more sour and spicy (which i love), but using the cheese they do balances out the flavors. they have great beans and rice. but, my personal favorite has to be huevos rancheros. i have a hard time ordering anything else.   i visited restaurant mexico the night before last with a friend who was craving mexico city style. we were fully satisfied. what we didn't realize is that we came in just before closing. but, we didn't feel rushed at all. in fact, they refilled our bowl of chips and salsa when the food came out.   i've lived in mexico city and the flavors here are the closest i've found in phoenix to the food i would eat there. this in mind, the sauces accent the flavors of the chiles and tomatoes more simply and without sugar. sour and bitter flavors can be part of the overall allure of these type of sauces, hence the "watery" salsa that comes out with the chips. it is a simple tomato and chile salsa without frills, but that is the style.    the only complaint i have is the enchiladas are a traditional small size. that said, i could probably eat a platter full.</b_review>
<b_review>authentic mexican food in the heart of bustling downtown tempe. service was good and they gave us more chips when we asked for them (sign said only one per table.) try the chimichanga if you're into the that- mix it up & don't feel you have to rely on the meals to construct a tasty plate.</b_review>

<text>why is it so grainy?   are cookies that are mostly organic supposed to feel grainy? after skimming through the other reviews on here, maybe i just went on an off-day. it was halloween 2009 when i stopped in with a friend for a couple of cookies, and decided to take home a dozen other cookies, and another dozen cupcakes. i guess i should've tasted them before i decided to drop $40 on 2 dozen treats.   the service was nice, but it felt a little awkward. there wasn't a huge selection of cupcakes/cookies, so i told them i just wanted to do 3 types of each to make it 2 dozens for my boxes. i was with a friend i hadn't seen in a while, so while we were in conversation, the counter-servers interrupted us a few times to ask which cookies/cupcakes i wanted.   i thought the taste of the cookies and cupcakes was pretty good, but i just didn't understand the texture of the cookies. the cupcakes here were actually "cup"cakes. i didn't like the little cups they cooked the treats in. they made it difficult to pry open the dessert to eat. i would have much rather prefer paper liners. i had so many, and was able to eat them through the week for breakfast, but i probably won't return.</text>
<u_review>i feel like a dork for reviewing a subway. i hate chain restaurants, and i hate fast food, so why am i doing this??   i feel like a super star whenever i walk into this store. it's always "hi, welcome to subway!" the young men who work here always use "ma'am, " and "sir" which i think is so old school, but they really are always so respectful. i've started to keep my stunna shades on in the store since i get the rock star treatment anyway.</u_review>
<u_review>bad, bad, bad....  i think i may have arrived during a bad weekend because i received the worst guest service at any hotel i have ever stayed.   the guest service agents were not friendly nor welcoming. although the staff was helpful, i sometimes felt like i was disrupting them. it didn't seem like a very busy weekend at the hotel, but it felt like 2 of the 3 who helped me that weekend were in terrible moods.   i ended up having to transfer rooms before i spent a night in their bed, and although getting a new room was pretty smooth, the result of it was a pain. in the process of moving, i did not completely transfer all of my belongings into the new room. i remembered the next morning, and was able to obtain my makeup bag by asking the front desk for help. it wasn't until i was doing the 3 hour drive back home on a sunday afternoon that i realized i had also forgotten 2 dresses in my room. i immediately called the hotel, and was told that i would be transferred to housekeeping/lost & found because the housekeepers were still in the building. i left a message for the lady to call me back regarding the dresses, but never heard back. i understand it is my fault that i forgot the dresses; however, i wonder if it is a hilton policy to only return what was claimed, and not everything that was left behind?  also, every morning, i woke up to loud banging, talking and shouting. i have stayed near the laundry rooms in other hotels before, but this was bad. it sounded like they were under some sort of construction/remodeling. i did speak to the manager regarding the noise, and he said i wasn't even near the housekeeping room. he was also able to get my dresses for me and offered to have them shipped to me.   the price, management, free wi-fi and parking were definitely plusses, but for what i went through at this place, i won't  be returning. i'm glad others have been able to have a great stay though!</u_review>
<u_review>different...  i stayed here for the night of my birthday celebration a year ago, and i thought the place wasn't too bad.   the pretty good-sized rooms had wooden floor laminates that i wasn't used to in a hotel. it worked out for us since we brought a puppy! i thought the room and decor was very clean and it made me feel very comfortable.   if you're looking for a pool; however, this is not the place to stay. the deck could fit about 4 people to lay out comfortably in their loungers. and the size of the pool was awful. i could barely bathe the puppy in it, and he was a 3 pound pomeranian at the time.   my experience at the bar was wonderful. i was roaming the place by myself until my guest arrived, and the bartender was really sweet. the weird thing about it though is that the "business center" (two desktops) was set against the wall about 20 feet away from the bar, and another 10 feet away from lounging sofas. after leaving the bar, the bartender had a drink sent up to my roommate for my birthday drink. that's great guest service!   i've stayed at 4 other hotels (hilton garden inn, w, hyatt summerfield, and hyatt place) in the area since and this one is by far my favorite in terms of service and cleanliness.</u_review>
<u_review>amazing customer service and sushi. mediocre robata items.   i had the best birthday dinner here about 3 weeks ago. the couple who brought me here had been here 2 other times, so i knew i was in for a treat. we sat at the sushi/robata bar, and since the menu was just so vast, we decided to do the omakase and let our chef bring out what he thought we would like. we told him we wanted to do mostly sushi.   the amount of food we got was insane. i had never eaten so much in my entire life. the quality of their fish was outstanding. i was really impressed. here's just a list of the things that we were served: butterfish tataki with white asparagus, beef tataki with a chili ponzu sauce, fried tofu with avocado and wasabi mayo, burnt tomato salad, fried oysters with ponzu and shisho, 2 large toro tuna rolls, 2 kinds of spanish mackarel sashimi, tuna sashimi, yellowtail sashimi, sea bream sashimi, butternut squash tempura, yuzo marinated black cod, grilled wild madagascan tiger praws, grilled pork belly, cold soba noodles in broth with quail egg and green onions, baby pork ribs with sweet corn in butter and soy, and grilled shishito peppers with ponzu and bonito flakes.  are you still reading this?!? we were so incredibly full, and they said they had some lamb cutlets for us too. unfortunately, we had to turn them down and ask for dessert.   side note: the manager, william, knew we were there to celebrate my birthday, and he actually gave us a traditional shot of japanese sake. the drink was dry, and really smooth and was served in a tall shot glass placed inside a wooden box. it is customary to pour the sake so it overflows into the box for prosperity. when done sipping on the shot, you pour the remaining sake from the box into the glass and finish it.   back to the incredible dessert. we waited a good amount of time for our dessert and we were wondering why since they typically offer a sorbet. when they finally brought the dessert out, we were all amazed. not only we were served all the flavors of sorbet, but also an assortment of fresh fruit. here's another list: mangosteen, cherries, strawberries, kiwi, green tea custard w/banana foam, peanut butter sorbet, and yuzu sorbet. my hands down favorite was the yuzu sorbet.   overall, this place offers the best customer service, and they have a great selction of fresh fish. the items that were grilled were inconsistent. sometimes it was overflavored, and other times the food was bland. i can't wait to go back here and just eat some sashimi.  i would also highly recommend the blood orange margarita and honeycomb shochu!</u_review>
<b_review>nice little neighborhood bakery.  i haven't had their cookies yet, but their cupcakes are awesome.  great variety to choose from.  my favs include the chocolate, lemon, brown velvet, and golden grahams (yes, those golden grahams).  i was worried i'd have to order in advance but came in here on a thursday after work and they had plenty in stock so i grabbed a dozen.  a little on the pricey side at $35/dozen, but still cheaper than sprinkles (and not nearly as heavy).  soon i'll try the cookies.</b_review>
<b_review>so i gave it a 3 because the cookies are a 5 and the cupcakes are a 0. cupcakes are not moist flavorful nor are they very sweet or good at all. science experiment gone wrong! but cookies are perfect just stay away from cupcakes here.</b_review>
<b_review>i love cupcakes, so it was exciting to be in a new state and try a cupcake war champion. being our first time in phoenix we got lost trying to find this place. we were on 7th avenue by mistake and then we found 7th street but they do not have an "urban cookies" sign out front, so we passed it. not fun. when we did get there, it felt dead, the server was not very engaging. they had no chocolate flavors, no brown velvet, no smore cupcakes. which is a  shame, i really wanted to try the brown velvet, it was the reason we drove to find them. we had a banana cupcake and a lemon cupcake. a banana cupcake is very hard to achieve in my opinion, because it can easily become a dense muffin. magically they did achieve fluffy cake but was ruined by the dense greasy frosting. it left the greasy coat on my lips. the lemon drop was not my favorite, too sweet. i normally would not get these flavors but since they were out of their star cupcakes we were left with "mehh" cupcakes. a shame.</b_review>
<b_review>hello, my name is faith, and i am a cupcakeholic.  it started at a very young age. doctors and television shows would run warnings about cupcakes informing our parents that they should keep them away from us for our health. my parents were able to protect me for a while, that is, until i grew old enough to attend birthday parties on my own without their supervision (age 5).   the music blared, the party dresses swirled, the party favors circulated. at last, the platter of cupcakes arrived. everyone was doing it, i would be left out if i did not join it... after all one wouldn't hurt right?  at first it was just a party thing. birthday party= quick fix in the name of celebration. after a while, it became a morning thing to accompany my coffee. then it spiraled into me eating them at home by myself. i knew i had hit a low when i began to replace meals with a cupcake.    one night, as i tossed in bed with the idea of eating a cupcake. i gave in a grabbed a cupcake in the refrigerator and ate in on the kitchen floor. i knew i had hit rock bottom.   at 2:25am that night i made a decision. i would no longer be oblivious to any cupcake. i would use all of my cupcake craving energy on one cupcake a week. as a cupcakeholic, that is a massive amount of energy to put into one cupcake.  it was hard at first, but slowly i progressed with the support of family and friends who had gone through similar issues in the past.  that one weekly cupcake is often one from this delicious (and cute) little bakery called urban cookie. is it worth skipping mediocre cupcakes throughout the week for one cupcake?   the answer is yes. i only go for the good ish now, and when it comes to cupcakes this place hits the spot!  go urban cookie! :)</b_review>

<text>i had the cajun last week with a giant 34oz cider..  the food was awesome.  pasties are typically pre-made, although by pre, i think they mean within the last 20-30 minutes..  mine was fresh out of the oven.  so delicious.  never eaten anything like it.  the service was great, everyone was very friendly.  i sat at the bar, so i got to watch the chef's preparing the next batch.  be sure to tip those guys too.   i'll be back soon, with company.  i have a few more pasties to try..</text>
<u_review>awesome dive bar. recently opened and turned what was a quiet place into a thriving fun bar. go see the girls all dressed up, play poker or pool, and enjoy some great drink specials.</u_review>
<u_review>lunch at pei wei is basically a done deal.  food is consistently fast and good.  the staff was very accommodating, basically creating a new dish that my son would eat, but giving us the child's price still.  can't go wrong here.</u_review>
<u_review>my third or fourth visit here.  they were very busy today..  the whole grill was full and they had 10-12 more orders stacked up.  it is hard to complain about the food at a place like this..  you pick what you want so it is basically up to you to make it good.  that said.  i like yc's.  yes, their meat is freeze dried, but the dishes seem more customizable..  especially when it comes to the sauces.  i don't want pre-made ones laid out..  give us all the ingredients, and a guide, and let us decide.  i'll be back because everyone at my work loves this place..  i don't think they've had yc's.</u_review>
<u_review>4 stars just because i have not tried the food here yet.  this place has one of the best scotch selections in town.  matt who was the bartender last night was very cool.  even helped me prank a bartender at cheurvont.  so funny..    had a great time, and will most certainly be back..  also, i will update with a food review once i actually eat there..  :)</u_review>
<b_review>the best word i can think of to describe this place is charming. my boyfriend introduced me to this place and at first i was thinking of a fancy hot pocket (not something im particularly a fan of). as i walked in i was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere from the dim lights to the dingy checkerboard floor tiles, it reminded me of one of those hidden treasures i used to find burrowed around nyc. i ordered a hibiscus tea which if you are like me and enjoy unsweetened tea you will absolutely adore it. i poked through the menu and nothing really caught my eye until i came across the lamb vindaloo and i had made my decision. the food took a while to get there but considering the very chill setting and laid back personality surrounding this place it shouldn't bother you at all. it tasted great the only improvement they could have made was maybe putting a little rice in the pasty as well but to each his own. what really made this pasty delish was the cream sauce that accompanied it. i brought the heat down while complimenting the flavor. when all was said and done i was stuffed and had leftovers. we also go the garlic mashed potatoes which are equally as amazing but i would advise against getting them for take-out because they only taste good fresh. me and my boyfriend love this place so much that we started a project where we get cornish pasty once a week. he is starting at the top of the menu and im starting at the bottom and working our way down and up and trying every single pasty on the menu. oh yes....its happening.</b_review>
<b_review>i found cornish pasty via yelp about 2 years ago while visiting phoenix area for work.  it made such an impression on me,i keep hoping i get to go back to try more variations on the pasties.  we had so much fun with beer and music also last time that i hope the expansion didn't get rid of the hole in the wall feeling.  anyway my coworkers are placing orders for me to bring back pasties for them.  i don't know how i'm gonna fly with those, but we'll see.   it's probably gonna be  110 plus or minus, but the fact that with of all the great places in phoenix im still drooling about this one means i gotta give it a 5.</b_review>
<b_review>i liked this location so much better than the dobson one! maybe it is the atmosphere, but to me the pasty even tasted better. i wish i lived closer to this location. had the greek pasty, and it was wonderful.</b_review>
<b_review>i don't get to the u.k. often enough, so this place is a bit o' for me: just enough $$ spent on keeping the inspector from shutting the place down, the rest of the hard-earned margin goes into the owners' pockets.   i have no idea what this long sliver of a place used to be, but it's become heaven for publovers since - a bar that stretches all the way east to apache junction with barstools stretching all the way back to the flintstones, and teensy little 2fer tablet-tables squeezed into the longwall across.   seemingly dozens of line cooks doubling as servers, seemingly dozens of taps serving wonderful fermented grains, and the meat, fish and veggie pies - my island ancestors never had it so good!</b_review>

<text>we've eaten here twice.  both on weekend, one for breakfast, one for lunch.  setting is great.  nice atmosphere.    service is fair.  friendly, but not overly attentive.  food is just okay.    here is the great thing about them for breakfast/lunch.  the $10 mimosa special is an entire bottle of champagne with a large caraffe of orange juice.  enough to get 3-4 people tipsy over breakfast.  $4 bloody mary was decent.  mac & cheese is tasty but nothing gourmet about it.   chicken sandwhich with bacon was just okay.  pretzel bun best part.  eggs are okay on the breakfast platter as well.  fries with grated parmesan cheese and red sauce dip is okay, but nothing special.  after two times, with all of the fantastic places to eat downtown, i probably won't be back.  seems like it's a better place to go to visit the bar than the restaurant.  when busy, with outdoor, it would be a terrific venue.</text>
<u_review>food is pretty good.  drinks and appetizers are kind of expensive, compared to entrees.  i've had the enchiladas and the pollo relleno, which is creamy and really doesn't take "mexican" to me compared to the entire rest of the menu, but tasty.  in general, this places tries to be fancy gourmet, and sort of succeeds, without the "oh my god" experience you get at truly amazing places.  service is just okay both times i've gone.  crowded, but in good way, both times.  i'll keep coming back, but it's never going to be one of my favorite restaurants.</u_review>
<u_review>it's got all the personality of a subway restaurant, and the staff seems clueless, but they do grill them some mean kabobs.  the meat is the central item here.  everything else is just fair.  the rice is fair, the pitta is like you tore into a package of pita bread from trader joes.    i had stuffed grape leaves too which were seved hot, and tasted off as a result.  i've never had hot grape leaves.  anyway, back to the meat.  had the lamp, perfectly grilled medium, tasted outstanding.    but, the star of the show was the chicken.  it's perfectly marinated in some yellow curry, which you can barely taste when cooked, but it's lean, juicy... just good.  i think if i was going back i would just get either the chicken entree or the lamb sandwich.  i think the entree lacks sauce... which would make it much better.  anyway, i'll be back for a cheap, good pile of grilled meat.  i'll just skip all the sides.</u_review>
<u_review>really hit or miss.  first of all, the atmosphere is terrific.  modern, minimalist, big open spaces.  very nice.  ouside patio, when the weather is right, would be lovely for cocktails and food, around a fire pit.    i've eaten here twice.  once for lunch, once for dinner.  the restaurant clearly is for hotel guests and corporate types.   i live downtown, so tried it despite this.  the food as a whole is decent to good.  it's very hit or miss though.  for example, last night my wife orders the organic salmon.  it was absolutely delicious, cooked perfectly, slightly rare inside and crispy on the outside.  on par with the best fish houses i've ever tried.  for me though, i tried the skirt steak.  it was a $2 piece of meat, barely adequately cooked, drenched in about 100 grams of fat/oil.  i guess to hide the fact that you just got completely scammed into eating a tough, fatty, crappy piece of meat.  i guess i'm more of a filet kind of guy, but honestly, this was one of the worst steaks i've tried.  deserts were okay.  appetizers were just okay as well.  presentation of everything was outstanding, however.  i'd even be back here many times if it was more reasonable in price.  but for the money they are charging, i just demand better food, better service.  even if the menu is creative, and the setting is one of the nicest modern restaurants i've recently had the pleasure to dine in.  particularly frustrating since it's only two blocks from my loft.  by all means, if you go here, skip the steak!</u_review>
<u_review>i know this place is a phoenix institution.  and it is quite nice inside compared to many chinese restaurants.  i was invited to lunch here by a colleague who had dined here many times in the past.  i felt the lunch menu was perhaps a bit overpriced, given the quantity and quality of food.  i ordered the kung pao shrimp ($8.25), which was a spicy dish, but ordered it hot.  it came so mild i might as well have ordered shrimp in lobster sauce, with some peanuts thrown in.   there were about 10 peanuts, a 1/2 cup of sauteed green onions, and about 4 medium sized shrimp, to go with fried rice that had nothing in it and an egg roll the size of my thumb.  it was nice it came with hot tea.  was it outrageously priced?  absolutely not.  would i eat here again if someone invited me?  of course.  but if it's my choice, there are much better chinese restaurants to be found.</u_review>
<b_review>we dropped in last night for a snack before the sigur ros concert (amazing!) and came away totally unimpressed. the waiter was extremely nice and very attentive but the food was very blah! i had the pesto pasta with shrimp and it was ok but not enough flavour  at all. annie and di shared the lettuce wraps which were very "wet", and then they shared the veggie sandwich which was also nothing to write home about. on top of it all di was sick in the night but that is likely due to her having a margarita. won't be back there.</b_review>
<b_review>food is incredible and they're not stingy with their alcohol! love and met the owner and he's just the sweetest.   only complaint would be the male bartender with the glasses. very rude guy you can notice by the constant scowl on his face. if you want to be treated like an idiot (and not someone who is about to give money) then order drinks from him.   if you enjoy being treated like a human being, and not a piece of meat or an infant, i highly recommend you order your drinks from the female, short, blonde waitress. she has excellent customer service, will talk to you like a human, and won't make you question why you came to bliss rebar in the first place!</b_review>
<b_review>service was great. food was below par and not worth the price at all. really there was a major lack of flavor and originality.</b_review>
<b_review>let me first just caveat this review by saying i'm from los angeles so you're welcome to dismiss it as the ravings of an out-of-towner.  i stumbled onto bliss rebar on a hot day when i was sweaty and looking for somewhere to kill time after wandering roosevelt row. bliss rebar emerged like an oasis of fun on an otherwise dead street. my first thought was, this is the abbey of phoenix! the abbey is the main gay bar in west hollywood, but every city has one. a place to load up on drinks and people watch while munching on mediocre food. at these types of establishments it's an accepted fact that the food will be bad because well-groomed gay guys are on diets anyway and the last thing they need is a good meal.  well, bliss rebar fits this profile perfectly and does the job wonderfully. but what i don't understand is where all these reviews for the "good food" are coming from? the quinoa and lentil salad i had tasted as if it came straight from the supermarket package. there was nothing creative or fresh about it. the "staff creation" drink that i ordered tasted like a weak vodka cranberry, to the point where i wondered if i had been given the wrong concoction.  the staff was efficient and skilled, just personable enough to make you never feel forgotten about. but i just wish people would stop describing the food here as good.</b_review>

<text>the good news is that they have negra modelo at 2 for $2.50 at happy hour, which has to be some kind of scottsdale record.  the bad news is that it's a mexican restaurant that seems to want to be a titty bar when it grows up.   the other reviewers aren't kidding when they say that every girl working here has implants.  big humongous ones.  not that there's anything wrong with that but it did confuse me on the concept somewhat. friendly servers though.  the food - at least what i had - was barely edible.  stick to the $1.25 beers.</text>
<u_review>happy hour review.  we stopped by to try the much ballyhooed happy hour and were were pretty damn underwhelmed.    first of all, i guess i'm failing to see what's so happy about a $6.00 spicy tuna roll and $8.00 drink.  secondly, like other non-japanese sushi joints in this town (cough, cough ra sushi), this is sushi for people who don't really like sushi.  thirdly, seriously attitudinous staff, but one look at the uber-douchy clientele explains that.  pass.</u_review>
<u_review>over-priced corporate chain "high end" restaurant.  no reason to eat here unless you happen to work in the building next door.  the steaks are about the same price as mastros/ruth's chris/morton's but not remotely in the same league. not prime, not aged, absolutely mediocre.  appetizers and sides were all of the same middling quality.  lots of better places to eat downtown and for a lot less money.</u_review>
<u_review>mrs. wanderer and i are not  fans of buffets in general but on this particular day our original destination (sakana) was closed and this was literally the next restaurant we drove by.  we were starving so we stopped in.  we were pleasantly surprised.  the selection was huge and the food was surprisingly good.  we would have settled for merely edible but it was actually pretty tasty. very wide selection of everything and nothing that we had was less than good and a few things were excellent.  not exactly health food or haute cuisine but it struck us both as much better than it needed to be.  our waitress was extremely friendly.  and at $7.99, you really can't beat the price.</u_review>
<u_review>interesting and fun but not quite delivering the goods for the price.  my wife and i stopped in for happy hour the other night to check out the new place in town.  we arrived around 5:30 and there were perhaps 20 people in the bar and restaurant.  we sat at the bar and ordered five appetizers and some drinks.  we tried some of their signature drinks and thought they were pretty tasty.  we liked all the appetizers, although they tended to be on the small side with the exception of the squid, which was a standard portion size.    the atmosphere is modern, hip and fun although i have to say it seems to be trying a bit too hard in certain respects.  i like a modern eclectic feel as much as the next guy, but sometimes they're a bit too creative for their own good here.  for example, instead of a napkin, you get a kind of quilted kitchen towel.  sure, why not, but we're veering into the realm of the twee and the forced with this kind of thing.  the bar stools however seem to have been designed by the marquis de sade.  they are literally the most uncomfortable bar stools i have ever sat in.  they're a kind of rippled, heavy western style wood with no back. so you've got no support for your back and, worse, the wood cuts sharply into your thigh.  looking around the bar, virtually every single person at the bar was standing next to their seat.    the bar began to fill up with single women and seemed to maintain a roughly 8:1 ratio of women to men, a phenomena i've noticed at other high-end joints in town.  the bartenders were very friendly as were the other patrons.  final verdict?  mixed.  in a town where every restaurant serves the same comfort food classics, it is definitely encouraging to see somebody dare to serve something other than cheeseburgers and the like.  on the other hand, the portions were really a bit skimpy, even at happy hour prices.  five appetizers later, we were still a bit hungry and that's not really so happy.  (try eating five appetizers at wildfish or rokerij. go ahead, i dare you.)  there's a certain scottsdale bimbo quality to the place (and i'm not talking about the clientele).  it looks great but it's not terribly comfortable and in the end, you may not be quite as satisfied as you thought.  five appetizers, two cocktails, a wine and a beer were $50 bucks plus tip.  note to management: change the damn bar stools already!</u_review>
<b_review>what shoes should i wear? seriously i am going out so i can't wear sneakers or sandals but i don't want sand on my nice shoes. what to do.  first off i have never eaten the food here. i usually come to hang out with friends and have drinks.    first who has a outdoor patio in az with out mist and big fans?  the beers and other drinks are a bit pricey.  after 10 there is a cash only cover charge so they can evade paying tax on it.  in general nothing great at all.</b_review>
<b_review>wouldn't disagree with the negative reviews about this place. but bottom line, i always have a good time here. i have not tried their food.</b_review>
<b_review>i tried going here to use my groupon earlier this week but they were closed for renovation. they're changing their name too. bummer - i wish they updated their web site that they would be closed.</b_review>
<b_review>$1 taco tuesday produced some mighty tasty taco's, but the place was slow and lifeless. i love the concept of the outdoor beach, pool, and surfboard tables - walking around in the sand makes you feel like you're on vacation. the inside is huge, but feels like any other mexican restaurant with a bar. bring your friends and try this for happy hour, or late on the weekends - when it turns into more of a club.</b_review>

<text>i am tough on burger joints. my allegiance lies elsewhere...... but i seriously gave zinburger a 150% shot.   first of all, who wants to dine on a huge burger while staring a huge mural of a cow in the face? not me! makes me feel bad. probably a big reason i am a fan of chic'fil'a, eating chicken while staring at a cow, awesome! anyway..... the decor is cool enough, other than the giant cow watching you eat his cousin.   on to the food. $10-13 for a burger seems to be a standard these days for the upscale burger joints. so, it didn't really bother me. if it came with a side it would have been perfect. so the roommie and i want to get a good taste of everything so we shared a few options; the turkey burger, a glorified bacon/cheddar burger, double truffle fires, zucchini fries and a mint chocolate shake.   1.) turkey burger - probably the best i have ever had. perfectly cooked, great flavor and seasoning and the toppings were great. cabbage rather than lettuce is a genus idea!  2.) bacon/cheddar burger - meh.... could have gone without ever having this thing in my life. first of all we asked for it to be cooked medium and when it showed up the bun was a bloody mess, i would call that rare. the bacon and thousand island dressing battled to the death and neither won. way too over powering for such a dominating burger. over all, wouldn't order it again, ever!  3.) truffle fires - how do you f*** up truffle fries? it's damn near impossible. they were great. i could tell they were freshly cut and were served with an awesome aoli. get 'em!  4.) zucchini fries - blech! almost sent them back just to get them out of my face. looked awesome and tasted worse than original cheerios. the batter they are in sucks, is soaked up all the oil from the fryer, and were as soft as noodles. i tried to make myself eat 3 of them but couldn't take it anymore.  and finally...  5.) mint chocolate shake - it was okay, in the most generous way. way too much milk was added so within 5 minutes is had morphed into this sloppy-slushy-watered down concoction that bored me. flavor alone, great! but the texture, disappointing. i will stick with the diner, where they know how to do it right.   i have to say the staff was great. very friendly and were there to take care of any need we had. but for the food itself, i will only ever be back for my once every other month turkey burger craving.</text>
<u_review>i had no idea they were open for lunch! perfect since the boy and i were down town during lunch the other day.   we stopped in around 2:30 inthe afternoon. no wait! i couldn't even believe it. i hadn't eaten there since i was a little girl, but it was just as good as i remember.  we got a couple beers and split the margarita pizza. it was sooo yummy! perfectly crispy on the edges and lots of flavor. the service was a tini bit slow, but no big deal, we loved it.   if you want great pizza and dont want to wait the normal 3 hours during dinner, you should hit up pizzaria bianco while the sun is still up, less wait time if at all.   enjoy!!</u_review>
<u_review>i would give them 5 stars if they were just a bit cheaper.... but still love the sprouts!!   most of the stores are pretty conveniently located around town, many in the areas i shop, which it great! this one in particular is walking distance from my house. love it!   the other day i stopped by to grab a bottle of wine and something to make for dinner. the guy that checked me out made some great recommendations on some other bottles of melbach wine, as that was what i was getting. i am excited to try them next time. they have some great fish and meat selections. they have a great black peppered steak kabob that you must try. they also have some great quick dinner items like veggies, mashed potatoes that are my fave, and meat loaf.   also, probably my fave part is the parking lot is big! wide lanes and front of store parking. very convenient, and people aren't racing around to get spots. love it! as compared to fry's where i nearly get rear-ended every other time i am there. sheesh!</u_review>
<u_review>all ajs are the same, you pretty much know what you are getting into when you walk in.   i have to tell you about this one specifically though. i get lunch here all the time in between shifts from work. ajs is close and they always get my in and out with a quickness.   their sandwich's are supper yummy, the chunky chicken salad or tuna are great choices. they also have a great salad bar. anything you could want; roman, mixed greens, ice berg, radishes, three different cheeses, black beans, corn, salami, egg, carrots, cucumber, olives, tomato, croutons, and three or four different dressings. they charge you by wight, so depending on your appetite it's pretty affordable.   i have never tried their sushi, but they looks great, fresh and a really great variety. again, the iced tea is awesome.   due to the kick butt work out and diet i have been committed to lately i haven't been able to frequent the pastry and sweets counter. but you only have to take one look to know it all looks amazing. tastes amazing too. my favorites are the lemon bars and napoleons and fruit tarts. grab some treats from here to take to your next dinner party, you will make their night!</u_review>
<u_review>i really am a fan.   for those like me, who basically only cook for ones self, and have a day job and need to take lunch with them to work, and have a love for wine this place has it all.   it is fast to get in and out of, i know exactly what i need and where to go to get it. the prices are just right, and the portions are perfect. i especially love the 50% section, the inventory that is about to hit it's expiration date. i have found some pretty amazing buys in this glorious corner.... ahi tuna steak for about $1.50 a lb., garlic loaf for $1.00, fresh&easy brand ice tea $0.98, yogert $0.25, home bake pizza $3.00, i could go on and on. they also have some very good sauces and dressings that i have found to be great to cook with.   i have found some of my favorite wine here as well. i am a very firm believer in that one can find a very decent bottle of wine for less than $10, less than $5 in f&e's case. recoletta (melbach, from australia) $4.99 is great, they also have kona chardonnay for $2.99 that is actually pretty good. cheap wine, love it!   if you haven't been yet, you must go!</u_review>
<b_review>hubby, baby and i ate lunch here on a saturday afternoon.  we were excited to eat here, as we are great fans of fox restaurants.  during the day, this place is great for kids.  there is a nice patio with lots of open space, perfect for fitting a stroller or high chair next to a table.  it has a nice crisp ambiance, and it's great for people-watching.  the menu is simple, a few burgers, a few salads, a few sides, a few deserts.  the burger options are a bit limited, but the menu does allow you to customize your burger with several toppings with variations ranging from manchego cheese, caramelized onions, avocado to truffle oil.  hubby and i decided to split the zin burger, the blt salad and the truffle fries with truffle aioli.  the zin burger was delicious.  it was topped with onions which had been caramelized in zinfandel, manchego cheese, mayonnaise on a whole wheat bun.  the onions paired well with the cheese, and we were definitely satisfied.  the burgers are cooked to order, and it was cooked perfectly.  the burger was enormous, and we definitely felt as though to feel satisfied and full, we did not need the salad we had ordered.  this was fortunate because the salad was lacking.  the bacon tasted like bacon bits, it was sprinkled with powdered parmesan cheese, the tomatoes were mealy and the "cowboy" ranch dressing tasted like hidden valley.  it came with what was probably romaine lettuce, but it was so pale, it looked like sad leafs of iceberg lettuce.  we were not impressed, and pretty much left the salad untouched.  the truffle fries were definitely the best part of the meal.  they were golden and crispy, with just the perfect amount of truffle oil.  the aioli didn't really stand up to the fries, but was still good.  all in all, while i would go back to zinburger, it is definitely not one of the better fox concepts restaurants.</b_review>
<b_review>we were on vacation and wanted to eat somewhere casual and non-pretentious--just looking for satisfying food. we were not disappointed. i ordered the zinburger and my husband had the kobe burger and a shake.  the zinburger was fantastic. actually, it was the best meal we had the entire trip and the least expensive. it was crowded and loud, but we didn't go there for the decor/ambiance. i recommend trying this place when you are in the mood for a burger.</b_review>
<b_review>have been to zinburger twice.   during the two trips items ordered by our party were:  zinburger, samburger, kobe burger, plain and simple burger,  hand cut fries, zucchini fries, banana creme pie, iced tea.  the best item out of the food items listed, in my opinion, was the banana creme pie.   the burgers did not "wow" me.  on top of that the food was laden with an exorbitant amout of salt.  the zucchini fries were so salty after about three bites i could not eat any more.  as previous reviewers have stated this place is expensive.    i think there are better hamburger places to be found.</b_review>
<b_review>my fiance and i were treated to lunch here by my future inlaws.  i would have to say this was one of my top 5 favorite burgers.  i believe that i ordered the zinburger and i was impressed by how you could customize what you ordered.  they had plenty of cheeses and toppings that you could add or switch out with whatever was on the menu.  also, if you do go here, order the zucchini fries!  they were amazing - perfect amount of batter/breading (just enough but in no way overwhelming the zucchini) and topped with some parmesan.  it is a little pricey - over $10 for the entree- but every now and then you should treat yourself.</b_review>

<text>dude, i am like lil' jon guest backin up usher with this place "yeah, yeah, yeah!"  friends have been telling me this place is fantastic for months, but i think my imagination of this place hindered me...i imagined a dirty beige dining room with blue checkered table cloths, rickety wooden chairs, like, mom art on the wall, and cutesy crap with bad beer and hot pocket like "treats". some late times at time out led me talking to a lady who works there, who told me of the vegan pasty one calls 45 minutes ahead of time. at 2am, with some amber bock, oh man, i was stoked. i woke up the next morning, counting down the hours till i could dial that number for the vegan goodie. she recognized my voice, and i didnt have internet, so she was sweet enough to list the ingredients-i ended up getting eggplant and a bunch of other veggies.   my companion picked me up, and its on the hardy side of the university and hardy, fyi. we walked into a long, kind of dark hallway with small two seaters on the right and a bar on the left. dude...were we in the right place? this place was sleek-black and white decor, clean, hip, i mean, like urban chic man, but not pretentious. since it wasn't too buzy, we did the two-seater and she took our beer order (yummy beer selection-we did miss the happy hour at 5pm, but the prices were still fine), and ran into some friends.   the real star of this story is really the pasty-i learned i could add some quorn (the best meat substitute eva), but that was ok. my food with some sauce was amazingly comforting. not overly spiced, not overly cooked, loved the taters in it, i mean, there was nothing wrong with it-nothing. like a shephards pie, or a pot pie, or a calzone, who doesn't love a warm fold...? yeah? yeah? this is the bomb. and even though i was starving, i could barely finish it, but i felt perfectly content aftewards and not overstuffed at all.   i even have their sticker on my cell phone to advertise my love for this place-yeah, you heard right. i fucking blinged my cellie with cornish pasty!</text>
<u_review>a final stop for last call after enjoying a late night tapas, i was surprised by how small this place is compared to the other lounges/bars in oversized spaces arizona. i found it instantly comforting instead of cramped quickly.   you have a hostess area right when you enter. i checked out the lounge to the right and it had about three or four major seating areas along with some tables-but the people sitting there looked way comfortable and they weren't about to leave anytime soon.  we went to the left and there were high tables and stools set up. along the wall were large cushioned backs for loungers on the plush cushion. i opted for the stool and it was surprisingly fine-most stools for shorties make me feel weird since my feet are dangling. the rest of the space had more high tables and then a smaller bar area with stools. there was plenty of seating, and while it wasn't packed, everyone there looked like they were with friends or established dates and totally relaxed having drinks-i didn't feel any meat market here.  i was disappointed by the wine by the glass selection (not the highest caliber-hence the minus start) so i stuck with the martini selection. most 'tinis don't go under 7.50 but they also don't go over 10-pretty reasonable. the waiter was very down to earth and told me the truth about buying cigarettes-that the bar down the street would have them and be like 7.50-no thanks! so mad props to him for the low down.  we got the summer peach, the s'mores, afternoon delight, and raspberry "" (blanking out on drink name-sorry!). they fill their drinks to the brim and they are pretty damn strong. the peach one was refreshing and not overtly sweet-much like a belletini. the raspberry was like a popsicle...an adult popsicle-a bit too sweet for me but had real raspberries on the bottom. the afternoon was a personal favourite of mine-citrusy but not too sweet, i'll def. get this drink next time. the s'mores was out of control-graham cracker crust? an actual marshmellow in it? whoa. it was delcious for a sip, but not sure i could get a whole one of those thangs...  overall, the vibe is very relaxed, clubby but not in your face and def. not a meat-market. i can't really describe the furniture since it was pretty dark and it didn't offend me in any way-it just blended in with the background which is what a good lounge should do when you are enjoying drinks with friends...</u_review>
<u_review>having been such a fan of teaxluxe in cambridge, ma and providence, ri, i was so stoked to see a tea place had opened up in tempe. unfortunately it happens to be in the tempe marketplace aka suburban exile, it is near the bookstore and the night gallery for asu and some nice seating outdoors to make up for it.  when i first entered, i felt intense deja vu-like this place looked exactly like tealuxe from the dark wood paneling, counter set up, tea menu, sophisticated booth seating with large mirrors and tea sets for sale. i mentioned it to the barista and she informed me the owner actually moved here from boston and based it off tealuxe-wha!  i was so stoked, i felt like i was in a special twilight zone episode where you get to go home again...only instead of harvard yard outside the doors you get kids with drooping diapers running in a dirty water sprinkler in a mall-well, you can't have it all.    chai, soy based too, boba, loose tea, delcious cold tea of the day, i wish they had the same food at tealuxe, where they served crumpets, salads and perfect little sandwiches and coffee cakes instead of the usual muffins, tarts, etc, which is their only docked star.  otherwise a fantastic place to relax to read or surf the net and sip perfect tea!</u_review>
<u_review>i was referred here from my bf, and first experienced them after a pretty bad bladder infection (i blame kentucky), and they were able to see us immediately, avoiding the emergency room hell of having to use the bathroom every five minutes with a fever for several hours.   since then, i have never had to wait a long time for appointments for my constant source of sinus infections and plumbing problems. located right past guadalupe on rural (accessible by bus, which i have done several times), ample parking. the waiting room isn't very big and the magazines are not very exciting, but then you don't wait very long. a real cross section of urgent care is here, and if you are in a "wait and see if you can be seen" bring headphones and your own reading to blast out the television showing reality tv and the cute kids playing on the insanely  loud toys.  we enjoy going here b/c after you do the initial weight/blood pressure, you aren't abandoned in the patient room, and while you are done with the doctor (nurse practicioner) pretty fast, i haven't felt rushed. after a particularly troubling run of infections that were affecting my quality of life and work, we did a lab test, and i received a call for the prescription quickly and felt better within days.  their payments for the appointments are really reasonable (anywhere between $20-$60), with the initial appointment larger due to registration. they always try to find the best deals for prescriptions and are sensitive to economic constraints and my general health for future appointment/considerations.  recommended.</u_review>
<u_review>i used to have pho pasteur in boston/chinatown at least once a week due to its cheap, veggie comfort food. their red bean and coconut milkshake kept me alive during flu seasons in new england.  now we are in a new era...or at least new area and i was jonesing for some pho. my brother found this place and i can't believe how often i drove or rode my bike past this tiny lil complex without realzing pho was in my vicinity all along. walking in, its set up like a proper pho place should be- absolutely no frills. white walls, simple tables and chairs, tvs on, and ordering counter with pyramids of spring rolls waiting for your take out bag. we got tea and water right away and i spinned around the lazy susan-yup, all the sauces and utensils are there. check. i got the simple veggie pho and veggie spring rolls with cold soy milk (it can get really hot and the broth means the heat can stay on your lips-soy milk is a good way to counter the effect). delicious. nothing crazy, all fresh, no non-sense staff, cheap amazing prices. quick service and my pho craving totally sated-this may be my new places i stop on my bike to eat something fast besides the near-by notoriously slow-serviced pita jungle.</u_review>
<b_review>excuse me. how in the world have i lived walking distance from cornish pasty company for over a month and have only barely heard of this gem?! thats what i want to know.  a friend introduced us to cornish pasty saying it is "the best restaurant ever". i best give it a try then right? the tempe location is smaller than the mesa location but i love its vibe. a small narrow walking space between people sitting at a counter behind the kitchen and people sitting at teeny tiny tables, dim lit lighting and candles and for the most part, pretty good music.   my man and i ordered the mexican pasty and the rosemary chicken pasty. they were unbelievable! so good. the mexican pasty was definitely the better of the two but i'd order both of them again any day. a little heavy dinner action to make a girl feel full and happy. i respect restaurants that have a plethora of vegetarian options. what generation are you living in if you don't offer veggie options these days? get with the program all you other restaurants. you know who you are!   i loved the entire experience and can't wait for our next trip.</b_review>
<b_review>easily one of my favorite places to eat in the valley. we first stumbled into cornish pasty with the thanks of yelp a lil over a year ago. been coming here ever since. i love this original location and its gotten even better with the expansion. for the money you really can not go anywhere as good in phx. my wife usually can share one pasty and be plenty full.   as for which ones to pick my favorite is the cajun chicken and the meat and cheese. i've also tried the pilgrim, italian and original all which are really good. i'm just a meat and potato type of guy so i like the more basic pasty.   overall a great place to come. it's dark, walls painted black, and usually good music playing. i've only come here for lunch so i can't speak for the night time scene but i'm sure it's chill and fun.</b_review>
<b_review>tried their chicken greek. it was tasty. but, it didn't wow me. why didn't it wow me? is my wow-o-meter broken? shouldn't the pasty wow me? i mean, this place has got some serious fans. and i totally dig this place. but, again, i wasn't wowed by the pasty. and i really think i should have been.   i need to go during happy hour, when i can pair my pasty with a rogue hazelnut brown.</b_review>
<b_review>probably the best restaurant in tempe.  cornish has been a favorite of mine for years now and i'm fortunate to live so close to the tempe location. the beer and drink selection is great and a pasty is just near impossible to beat. the staff is always attentive and funky.  people of tempe, we are fortunate to have such a place.</b_review>

<text>proof that quantity doesn't trump quality, no matter how good the deal is.  $20 for all you can eat sushi is an impossible deal to pass up.  but take my advice and spend an extra $10 to $20 somewhere else, eat less, and be happier.  the rolls at mido are infused with much more rice than necessary for the consumer, but just enough that the restaurant saves money on the expensive protein and fills up the customer faster.  the fish is also not every good quality.  want to avoid the rice?  you can get a massive sashimi starter if you ask.  don't.  it is the worst pieces of fish i've ever had.  also mind boggling are the rolls that are on the regular menu that are not on the $20 deal.  many of them are cheaper than the al a carte orders of what's on the all you can eat menu, but for some reason, they won't let you have these without the up charge.  probably because they looked tastier than what's actually served.  having said all that, i really wasn't surprised.  what was i expecting when i was paying so little?  but what really got me down was the service.  the staff is friendly, but horribly disorganized.  i was with a group of 11 and we ordered on three separate tickets.  we figured that they would bring our orders on plates that coordinated with those tickets.  we figured wrong.  they brought everything out on big boats with little rhyme or reason as to what was placed on what tray  with some confusion, we had to ask or just taste in order to figure which roll was what.  we then explained to the server that some in our group had dietary restrictions so it was important for our next round of orders that we got we ordered on the ticket we ordered with, so that someone didn't accidentally eat something they shouldn't.  the server seemed fine with that, but when we made our second order, they once again just made a big mishmash out of it.  thanks for listening to a simple request.  one thing that was pretty fun about mido was the music and lights that play when there was a birthday.  once i finally figured out what was going on, it was a lot of fun.  way better than an annoying birthday song by the staff.</text>
<u_review>the fry bread itself is fantastic.  too bad everything emerson puts on it isn't.  it's not bad, but there's nothing special about it.  no seasoning.  no sauce.  just a pile of bland mexican food tossed on top of the bread.  emerson is a regular at food truck friday, and appears to have fans all over the valley.  i suggest hitting up the truck for a good snack, but avoid the meals.</u_review>
<u_review>i'm not a home decor or kitchen aficionado, but whenever i need something for the house that i want to be a step up from target (or can't find there), i can always find it at bed bath & beyond.   the store is big, and has nearly anything you can think of. if you actually look hard enough, you can even find some random stuff that you would never expect to find. prices are very competitive. not typically the lowest unless there's a sale, but there's always a deal to be found.   the staff is also very helpful. i was once there to buy some place mats and matching napkins for my table. they were one napkin short, and the cashier dug through several boxes in the back to find them. while that's something i know a good store employee should do, i know that it's just as easy to lie and say they're out (bed bath & beyond doesn't strike me as commission based).   for me, the big score is k-cups for my keurig coffee maker. bed bath & beyond has the best selection i've seen at any store. and only charges $9.00 for an 18-pack (about a buck less than most places sale prices).   it's not a store that's really in my range of interest. but for those of you who love home accessories, this is a great place for you.</u_review>
<u_review>another fast food mexican joint in the spirit of chipotle or qdoba. but, panchero's does have two things that definitely stand out.   1. the fresh tortilla.  it's pressed and cooked in front of you. and when you finally take a bite out of your burrito, you can really taste the difference.   2. mixing the ingredients.  unlike chipotle, panchero's does one extra step before folding your burrito. the rice, beans, meat, etc, all get mixed and you get a fairly equal amount in each bite.   the problem. all those ingredients (other than the fresh tortilla) aren't quite as good as the other places. the price is about the same and they nickel and dime you for every extra, too.  i would never say no to panchero's, i just wouldn't pick it over anywhere else.</u_review>
<u_review>this place has kind of a small business feel for a franchise location of a big national chain.  the people here are extremely friendly.  i booked a truck through the budget website, and the reservation went fine except for a small issue that they worked around.  i did a weekday move and needed to return the truck after-hours.  the website only said that there may be a fee; however, this location doesn't have a key drop box, and they lock up the lot.   i clearly made the reservation saying that i would return the truck at night (8:30pm), so they allowed me to keep the truck through the next afternoon without charging me for a second day.  it was a little inconvenient, but a fair enough solution.  they also said i could park in the shopping center next store and put the key through the mail slot, but i was not comfortable with that.  i felt better leaving the truck in front of my house instead of on private property and in open view of a busy road.  the prices of the trucks are about the same as a u-haul, but for slightly smaller sizes.  but there are several online coupons you can find with a quick google search to make it much cheaper.  overall, it's a much better deal if you take a few seconds to look for those coupon codes.</u_review>
<b_review>i think i found my new "go to" sushi place.  i visited mido with my husband the other day based on a friend's recommendation and i am so glad i did.    my husband and i both had the all-you-can-eat sushi for $20.  as jared said, the sushi quality is not out of this world, but it is solid (good).  definitely a great deal for the price.   it is comparable to takamatsu's all-you-can-eat, but i think i prefer mido.  like takamatsu, the sushi is made to order and not pre-made, which is a huge plus!   there is a large list of rolls you can choose from and the buffet also comes with:  edamame miso soup assorted tempura or gyoza (i recommend the tempura) sashimi platter (if you love raw fish, do not miss out on this) ice cream (mango, green tea, or red bean)  all the above is brought to you.  you can also ask for fixings for korean style sashimi lettuce wraps (ssam, samjang, chojang).  if you love spicy, garlicky, fresh, crispy, food, i highly recommend it.  oh and for dessert, try the red bean paste ice cream at least once.  you won't be disappointed.  all three flavors are really good, but the red bean one is the best in my opinion.  the flavors are really delicate with a hint of what tastes like rose water.  seriously, it is really good.  refreshing too.  a great way to finish off a great dinner.     i'm not sure if you can forgo any of the above, and i will mention that like other all-you-can-eat sushi places you will be charged if you do not finish all the food you ordered, which makes total sense.  waste is not a good thing.  so, i recommend you take your time, just order a few things at first and order more once you finished what you have already ordered.  all-in-all this is good food and great service at a very reasonable price.  everything about it, from the enthusiastic greeting you get from the sushi master/owner to the the generous and delicious offerings for dinner, tells you that this is a place with heart.  the priority here is to make sure you have a great experience and it totally shows!</b_review>
<b_review>they have an all you can eat sushi special for $19.95.  the sushi was good, but nothing too special.  it was still an enjoyable experience for $20.  the service is ok.  the waiters weren't very friendly and they can be hard to find at times.  i have also been there for lunch.  the lunch prices are very reasonable.  i had the udon which had a good broth and chewy noodles -- just the way i like it.  it did take over half an hour for me to get my food.  they apologized but did not give an explanation.  (this only happened once)  i think it is worth it to try this place out.  good food at a reasonable price.  i just hope they improve their speed/service.</b_review>
<b_review>i usually go to mido sushi when i want sushi and sashimi. they have all you can eat sushi buffet which i like. service is pretty good. sushi, sashimi and rolls are good. but the problem is the speed and accuracy of the serving. it always takes long time to get the food in front of you. and very often, they don't bring all things that i marked on the order sheet. so if you want to eat all the foods you want, you should wait quite long time.</b_review>
<b_review>if u like real sushi - fresh sashimi-  than this place is not for you. my nigiri and sashimi were not fresh and extremely questionable  quite frankly scary. they could not get my order correct either. i wouldnt feed what they served me to my dog. serious fail.</b_review>

<text>places like this are the highlight of living in arizona. good access to cheap, delicious and authentic sonoran food. i tried chilaquiles here for the first time and they were amazing!! the horchata was pretty run of the mill but the empanadas were fantastic!   i also really like the market they have. a really great place to have in the neighborhood.</text>
<u_review>i'm so glad i came here for my first boba experience! i ordered the taro smoothie with boba on recommendation from a friend and it was so, so good. i can't really describe the flavor but i loved it.   the service wasn't great but sometimes you can write that off for an authentic experience like this one.</u_review>
<u_review>wow. tuck shop is totally one of those places that you want to remain hidden so you can have it all to yourself, but you feel torn because it is so incredibly amazing, that you know it deserves to be really successful. but moving on; ever since my first visit to the tuck shop 2 months ago, i have returned 4 times. each time a friend is visiting town i take them there because it is such a crowd pleaser.   like everyone said, you could just point to anything on the menu and be satisfied. i order the mac and cheese with lobstah~ every time but i've also tried the roasted beets, chickory salad, tamales, and chicken and waffles. all so so good. the cheese curds also out of this world!  they have good drink specials also!</u_review>
<u_review>sometimes the downside of yelp is that you read so many great reviews for a new restaurant and you garner these very high expectations. that's what happened with st. francis anyways. our bartender was not friendly at all. the dessert was very good however! hopefully next time the service will be better - sometimes you just catch people on an off night.</u_review>
<u_review>wow! i can't say enough good things about this place. the location is perfect, the menu is great, the drinks are incredible and most importantly, the service is the best i've received anywhere.   don't pass up the chance to visit. i'm there for happy hour at least three times a month!</u_review>
<b_review>i have not been here in years. i was very happy and excited to find that it is still as good as i remembered. i had a green chili burrito. it was a man's man sized burrito. it was packed with meat. i did not need to order sides, as this was very filling. the habanero salsa was just like nana made back in the day. good stuff. i left with a full tummy and my eyes rolling in the back of my head. yummy. you have to try it.</b_review>
<b_review>had a much better visit then 1 year prior.  my order was togo.  the a la carte taco's were generous on the meat and flavor.  especialy the tripa and pastor.  the carne asada was my least favorite.   the chile rellano was very nice.  the  bakery items that i enjoyed were the bread pudding, not the american style but a buttery bar/cake style and the sweet potatoe filled empanada which was a sweat soft  bread filled with autumn flavored sweet potatoes.  i will return for the tripas taco, chille rellano and the bread pudding without a doubt.   the prices are very reasonable and there is plenty of parking in this market style order and wait business.  do not go if you looking for a nueva taco bistro or fancy setting.</b_review>
<b_review>this is a place not to miss! we have been to all the mexican spots in the valley (los dos molinos, teepee, nando's, ajo al's,) and this is our new favorite!  we decided to give this place a try after a few years of living here and had a great authentic experience. the huevos rancheros were amazing and my husband had the chicken tacos- which were fantastic!  don't be scared away by what part of town it's in- it adds to the experience! be sure to get a pastry to go, the bakery is amazing!</b_review>
<b_review>we had to be near downtown today, and when scrolling through nearby restaurants on my phone i saw this one.  on google it's rated 5 stars.  here it's 4 stars.  and only a single dollar sign!  so we drove over.  the place looks like something you might find in mexico.  no hostess.  walk up to the counter, order your food, wait for your number to be called, walk into the dining area (ducking under a low arch if you over 6' tall) where you are greeted with basic tables and chairs.  seriously...if you didn't know you were in phoenix you'd swear you were in an eatery in mexico.  they also have a bakery and a market attached to the food counter.  on to the actual food.  as this was my first time here i ordered the chimi.  i usually do that so i have a basis for comparison to other places.  my wife had the albondigas soup.  we both liked our dishes.  the chimi was done perfectly.  a light crunch of the shell.  not overcooked, not greasy.  the chicken was moist and tender.  and it was a pretty big chimi.  i think one does need to add some pico to it because the chicken's seasoning was very mild.  the pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference.  and the mexican rice was very nice.  i wish it wasn't so far from home (gilbert) because i'd love to make this my "regular" spot for mexican food.  i would say it blows away just about every place else i've found in the valley, and is neck-and-neck with guerrero's (in tempe).  i can't choose between the two at this moment.  i hope to return here, and will be trying something different.  their menu is pretty extensive with several traditional dishes (including menudo, lengua, and albondigas).</b_review>

<text>just when i thought i had been to all the best "pho joints" in phoenix (i believe i have eaten in a total of 13!), up pops this one, which was listed (ranked) only as the #5 best vietnamese restaurant by the arizona republic. the arizona republic got it wrong; the pho was "ambrosia." very aromatic, nice amount of meat and delicious! not only am i ranking it #2 and only slightly behind dragonfly, it is by far the best looking and best appointed restaurant of any of the pho joints i have seen. also, it is run by a gorgeous vietnamese young lady who does all of the cooking and is usually there to greet you! great, i mean great springrolls complete or start this trip to "pho heaven!" - best springrolls in phoenix! on my second trip i had the chicken wings, recommended in the republic as "delicious," equally phabulous and have had them often since!</text>
<u_review>hard to imagine that as good as marilyn's is that there are only ten reviews here. okay, so the neighborhood is not so good, but i have been there in the morning (11 am), afternoon and evening and all is well. just now reviewing and not certain why i have waited so long. maybe i just didn't want share.   the fish? omg, the best! have had all three varieties of fish (cod, catfish and whiting) but being from boston, cod is my absolute favorite and this is the very best "fried cod" i have ever had. don't generally like catfish, but marilyn's is terrific! want to try all three, get the three pieces with one of each and you will know which to order next time. the owner has tremendous pride in what he does and obviously, that can be seen in his "product." not fond of the tartar sauce, but doesn't matter because the fish is so extraordinary. unlike most fish and chip joints in phoenix, the do not use the same batter on everything. makes a big difference. can't go without ordering fish and chips, so have only had shrimp as an additional menu item and they were excellent.  you just can't go wrong and if you are like me, you will get a craving every couple of weeks. fabulous!</u_review>
<u_review>this is my second favorite restaurant in phoenix (behind only tarbell's) and receives consistently phabulous reviews. i have had much on their menu and have loved almost all.   i have become a "pho aficionado" and i love the strong flavors in the best phos. cyclo's pho leaves a lot to be desired! broth is generally too thin, although the service is beautifully done. plus their pho is expensive when compared to other "pho joints" that i believe have better pho.  everything else i have eaten on their menu (and i have eaten most everything!) is indeed phabulous, so i will just go elsewhere for my pho phix! besides, i would miss not seeing justina (cyclo owner) who is a delightful experience, not to mention the delightful experiences available on their menu, other than the pho!!</u_review>
<u_review>an all time phoenix favorite of mine for lunch, that i have neglected to review, but was reminded by this most recent visit.  taking something so simple (brushetta, a cheese plate, soups) and turning them into "works of art" is an art in itself. have eaten mostly everything on the menu at one time or another and am never disappointed. they even changed my mind about liking brie - well of course their "triple cream brie" had a lot to do with that - heavenly!  their brushetta, in addition to being beautiful to look at is absolutely fabulous haven't had one i didn't like, in spite of the fact i am not all that fond of smoked salmon or tuna, but loved their preparation!  did i mention the "grilled cheese?"   don't ask - just order it!   $6? are they nuts?   no, it is worth it!  kind of what i think each time i order it!  lots of fun to have many for a great selection with several people sharing. probably all but the soups should be shared and even the soups can be, if you are with someone you really care about!  go, don't wait! wonderful for lunch, nice for a casual dinner and the wait staff is generally terrific!</u_review>
<u_review>most impressed as i have been to the proprietors parents pizza restaurant (twice) in ahwatukee and find it to be not very good with all of the flavors much to heavy. this experience was very different and maybe even extraordinary.  almost flaky crust, not nearly as thin as i like it, but done very nicely as a compliment to the toppings and not an overpowering plaza for them to sit on.  the potato pizza was to die for as was mushroom pizza (fungi) each with their distinctive flavors and all of the flavors of the various ingredients were allowed to come through, as opposed to just a mélange of flavor.  the calamari and shrimp (fried) appetizer was excellent also, although not a very big portion.  i am converted!</u_review>
<b_review>i hesitate to review this place because i've only eaten one dish here: #31, the vegetarian lemongrass beef vermicelli (bun). it's damn good and does a great job satisfying my vietnamese cravings. bun is one of my most favorite dishes, but since becoming a vegetarian, my choices were severely limited. i simply can't bring myself to try any other dishes because this one with fake beef is so good.  i'm bummed there are no vegetarian appetizers, however. most other places offer a tofu spring roll along with the pork ones.  all my omnivores like or love the meat offerings. in fact, my friend that introduced me to pho ao sen drives 25+ miles from desert ridge and eats here more often that i do.</b_review>
<b_review>man, their pho is really addicting. i eat here about once a week, that's how much i love it. i'm impressed every time. the decor is super modern and sweet, friendly and attentive staff, and most importantly the pho makes me want to cry (good tears of course) it's that good. every time i leave i can't wait to come back.</b_review>
<b_review>good pho, i would recommends it your looking for a nice restaurant to sit down and have some pho. the spring rolls are good as well but i've had better... the drinks they have are also good with the fruit bubbles in them.   edit: new ownership i think the pho is better!!!!</b_review>
<b_review>i absolutely love the food here! the service is good, the food is excellent and as far as the price goes..i can't complain. this is one of favorite places to eat.</b_review>

<text>i love uncle sal's! my fiance and i found it through a friend, and we were instantly hooked!   first, the service is outstanding! the people that work there are fun, outgoing, and make sure you are 100% satisfied with your order. after going there 3 times in 5 months, when we walk in we are greeted as friends! they remember our names, tease us for not coming in more often, and they'll even 'buy' us a glass of wine every now and then. they are great!   the food is even better! i go there for lunch (chiken marsala is devine) and for dinner, i haven't had anything on the menu i didn't like. i couldn't recommend this more highly!</text>
<u_review>ohhhh lgo, how i love you. you are the perfect place to go on a date, with a friend, with my family, with a group, by myself, with work associates, etc.   there is a bit of a wait if you go during peak times; however it is worth it.   the caprice salad, when they have it, is incredible. do not pass that up if your server mentions it. on a budget? pick up a bottle in the store (prices do start around $9.99) and they'll open it for you to enjoy at dinner (or before dinner if you are waiting.)  the pizzas may sound kind of funky if you are new to the joint, but don't fear. they know what they are doing.</u_review>
<u_review>food is delicious, however the service is a bit slow. don't go here if you are on a tight timeline :).  great live music on friday nights, so if you are looking for a different place, with lots going on in the background, with some good food, you should definitely check it out!</u_review>
<u_review>finally went to golden spoon last night... it lived up to the hype!   the flavors i got were cake batter and strawberry (yes, they let you do a two flavors, for no additional cost!) and they were delish! i ordered the small size, and was unable to finish it - so you really do get a lot for your money.  the service was great, and they let us sample as many different flavors as we liked, and even gave some great suggestions of combos. we'll definitely be going back :)</u_review>
<u_review>the headache the next morning is worth it...  went to papago for the first time for a friend's birthday happy hour. i never would have thought you could find such a fun brewery in a strip mall.  i'll be the first to admit i'm not a great beer drinker - i am the type to stick with a miller lite or whatever everyone else is drinking. at papago, their selection is incredible. it's just big enough that you realize that you should order something 'fun', but not so large that you are overwhelmed and give up and just guess at what to order.  the staff is really knowledgeable, patient and are really attentive. the orange blossom is crazy delicious, and they have a coffee stout beer that caught me by surprise - in a good way.  the food is great - the menu consists of great apps, pizza, sandwiches, and the salads are fantastic. great for an afternoon, happy hour or dinner. you gotta try it!</u_review>
<b_review>we go to uncle sal's every other week for lunch.  great atmosphere and great food.  not the "best" food, but it's always an enjoyable experience.</b_review>
<b_review>been here a couple of times for "occasion" dinners and i have never been disappointed.   yes, i am your typical "yelp" elitist. i don't enjoy mcdonalds, applebees or olive garden. uncle sal's is a legit spot for a nice dinner.  as soon as you walk in, you are treated to a nice, quiet, classy place. it's so "not scottsdale"....so if you are looking for a scene, go elsewhere.   this is where you take someone special for their birthday, or your parents when they come visit. the type of place where you want to engage in a conversation.   the server is very friendly....and even remembers you if you come back.  the menu has something for everyone, vegetarians, pescatarians, and carnivores alike.  the wine list is quite good (with awards from wine spectator), and a cozy bar as well.  there are only 15 or so tables, so if you want a table, call ahead for a reservation. it will help.  you'll like this spot....but don't come here expecting culinary dropout, or sapporo type of a vibe. it's an old school, quiet type of place. enjoy!</b_review>
<b_review>uncle sal's like the american italian uncle you wish you had.   the atmosphere... is a little "older generation" home vibe-y but the food here is good.  never ever order the half bottled wines. taste like crap out of the cardboard box, because it is.  i always get the same thing so i can't really speak for a lot of things on the menu but if you want a really good white wine sauce pasta.. this is the place to come.  zuppa de pesce is soooooooo bomb here.</b_review>
<b_review>went there specifically to try the eggplant that i had seen some good reviews on; it was good but not great status; the 3 star is given due to service and the italian dressing was great.  the garlic bread is dry and not as good as some reviews testify.</b_review>

<text>went here for dinner over the weekend with husband.  i kinda know what to expect from this place but felt like a sit down mexican restaurant and was in the neighborhood.  vibe is kinda like on the boarder, minus the tex mex part....right away we were seated to our booth, booth for two people was a little awkward.  it's a half moon shape but our view was looking out onto a huge party of over 20 people, not very chill feeling.  i ordered a large house margarita on the rocks and a mexican pizza.  food took awhile to get to the table, we were already on our second basket of chips before our food arrived.  pizza was ok, seemed like they skimped out on a lot of the toppings.  margarita was weak also.  i usually get a little buzz going on when i order a large one, but i didn't get anything from that one.  as always the food at macayo's seems to all drop to the bottom of your stomach like a rock....i think it's time to try something else even if i'm in the neighborhood.</text>
<u_review>this place has it all. i mean everything i was looking for. i own a kayak, and play disc golf, so they have a nice selection of accessories for both sports. i even got some really cool add on's to my kayak i haven't seen at any other stores in town. if you like camping you'll find a good selection here also. the prices are fair but they are retail prices. dick's does have a buyers club you can join to earn points for gift cards, it's worth filling out, sporting goods add up fast and i know i've gotten a few gift certificates in the mail from it already. they also have a nice selection of camping stuff. all the little nick nacs. just try and stay focused while shopping here, i know i went in here for one thing, and ended up with a cart full of stuff.</u_review>
<u_review>stopped in after buying a groupon.  food is way overpriced.  i had a $20 groupon and only got two sandwiches (no sides), and two drinks.  i also splurged and got a piece of pecan pie.  total rang up with me still owing $15 bucks. $35 bucks for two sandwiches and a piece of pie is a little ridiculous.   food was ok.  it was hot and the restaurant area didn't have any air conditioning.  we sat out in the grassy picnic area which was nice but it was still hot.  food was ok, but a little dry.</u_review>
<u_review>the staff here is super friendly and service was top notch.  maybe it's a scottsdale thing or something but two of us ate, had two burgers, french fries, the yummy sweet potato fries, and two shakes.. bill was $45 bucks.   ouch.. a little high..  had the volcanic burger which all the cheese when popped fell all to the bottom of the plate and not on my burger. so my cheesy burger wasn't so cheesy when i went to eat it.   the highlight of our meal was the sweet potato fries, they were just so yummy, more like a desert but i wouldn't mind swinging in for drinks and eating those.  the burger didn't really have a lot of flavor to it and feel apart making it hard to eat.  overall it's a nice clean place with good service..</u_review>
<u_review>was in the area checking out an exhibit at the phoenix science center and noticed the place was open for lunch.  i was super surprised no one was waiting outside and decided rather then to wait hours later to steal a seat with my husband and have a nice little lunch.  we ordered the rosa pizza and shared. it was yummy, and the perfect size for two people.  the pizza is handmade and put into the wood oven located within viewing distance right in front of you.  i guess i'm not that big of a crust person but being near the fire of course it was a little burnt, but that didn't bother me.   we sat at the bar so not to have to wait and got in and out of the restaurant super fast.</u_review>
<b_review>$2.00 for a side of sour cream, on a cold burrito. kept pushing alcohol even though we said we didn't drink. too bad this place has beautiful interior decorations.</b_review>
<b_review>i love macayo's food, and have to admit it is one of my favorite mexican restaurants.  i especially love this location.    they serve the best margarita's, nice and strong!  they have their own sweet & sour mix, which i believe is the secret.  the sunset margarita is a must try.    favorite foods: mini chimis, red corn taquitos and green corn tamale w/baja sauce. oh and lots of chips & salsa!  they also have a very large patio with live music on thursday's until 9pm.  the service is good and the bartenders are especially friendly.</b_review>
<b_review>it's pretty standard chain. service leaves a lot to be desired and you'll definitely find better.  turnaround is quick though and i don't spend a ton of time in the area so it's a quick go to that's right there.</b_review>
<b_review>usually decent mexican food here, but ate there recently and had the green corn tamale with green sauce and baja chicken enchiladas. only ate half of meal. when i got home i had the worst stomach pains and ending up throwing this all up. got food poisioning!!! won't be going here again.</b_review>

<text>i'd been eying total wine since their grand opening in july, and even more excited to go once i read brian s's review... i finally had a reason to go check it out - i was on a mission... a mission for prickly pear margarita ingredients!  this store is much bigger than it appears on the outside.  i walked in and didn't know where to start - but after getting my bearings, i realized that each isle was well-marked and there were tw employees all around asking if i needed help.  i found my way to the tequila isle which happened to be the same isle as mixers, but no  prickly pear juice or tequila was to be found.  i asked an employee and she took me right to the closest product they had - arizona high spirits prickly pear vodka.  even better for me since i'm more a vodka drinker than tequila!  andrea (the employee that helped me) was extremely helpful and took another step to take me to the az high spirits prickly pear vodka website where they have several recipes listed to make specialty drinks.  andrea also told me that tw does all kinds of tastings at the store, so i'll have to check those out sometime.  i can't wait to try the prickly pear vodka recipes soon.  more importantly, tw was a pleasant surprise and i will not hesitate to return for my beer, wine, and spirits needs!</text>
<u_review>it's been awhile since this place was reviewed... and probably just as long since my last visit.  in the last few months (or possibly more), this restaurant changed names (it was previously 'the counter') and cleared out the retail boutique area to make room for more seating.  future yelper nancie s suggested we meet for lunch here today, and i was impressed with the changes.  by no means is chloe's corner a high end restaurant... it's more like a retro diner with a modern feel.  it's the kind of place you order at the counter and pay for it, and then they bring your food to your table when it's ready.  it's also great for those who want to pick up something quick on the go...  we both ordered the chopped salad and a side of toasted cranberry walnut bread.  it was really tasty!  you can tell they use high quality ingredients... the salad is a unique combination of field greens, turkey, bleu cheese, walnuts, and grapes with poppyseed dressing.  i would for sure order it again although the tuna melt looked pretty amazing too!  there are several other 'classic' items on the menu such as grilled cheese, tomato soup, milkshakes, etc...  even more impressive than the lunch was the fact that i found a parking spot right away at kierland and i left without going into one single store.  i'm so proud of myself for that... any fellow shop-a-holics know how hard that can be!  although i did like this place when it was "the counter," it looks to me like the change that fox restaurant concepts made to this restaurant was a good one!</u_review>
<u_review>5 stars + a standing ovation!  just like doug t., i also attended the january 5th performance of the pajama game.  however, i actually showed up in my pajamas!  at first, my friend dede and i thought we may be the only ones in our pjs, but there were a handful of others too...  the show was a lot of fun... extremely talented cast, so much energy, great retro colorful costumes, and songs that i loved without even knowing the words to!  the orchestra and cast worked really well together and there were certain acts in the show that reminded me more of a 'stomp' type of show with the movements and sounds really in sync.  as doug mentioned, the lead roles of sid sorokin and babe williams really shined - they had great chemistry on stage!  this was a wonderful show.  it may have been my first experience seeing an arizona theatre company production. but it definitely will not be my last.  go see the pajama game while it's still in town - it's here until january 20th!  after that, they've got some other shows that i'm excited for as well...  one more thing - the herberger theater center is a wonderful venue; just make sure to give yourself a little extra time for parking before the show.  ______________________________________________________  to kill a mockingbird - march 27, 2008  another 5 star performance on this adaptation of harper lee's classic novel.  i attended this performance without expectation; i didn't really remember the story from the 'cliff's notes' version i'd read in high school.  aside from the challenge of hearing some of the dialog with the deep southern drawl, i thoroughly enjoyed this show.    i agree with erica l in saying that 'scout' was adorable and totally in character through the entire show - i loved her enthusiasm and no doubt she's got a future full of acting.  atticus and calpernia were standouts as well.  adult scout's narration of the show made the play flow... i totally felt compassion and mixed emotions during the show.  the racial divide has improved since the '30s when this story took place, but i think there's still more that can be done.  if only more people could be like atticus finch.  go see this show while it's here - you will not be disappointed!</u_review>
<u_review>when my friend shauna told me about an amazing zumba class she'd been taking, i was intrigued.  and when saturday rolled around and i slept in past the 8am spin class i'd been planning on attending, i remembered that the zumba class shauna told me about started at 10:00.  i called shauna that morning and she told me the class was at bricks studio.   so convenient, the studio is right down the street from me, yet i never paid any attention to it before.  but i pulled in to some very friendly people, and just before the clock struck 10, i paid my $10 and was dancing up a storm with marissa, the awesome instructor and a class full of women (and one man).  great energy, instruction, music, and more... i've never been a huge fan of zumba but i am now!  i may just make this a regular on my workout rotation!  come sweat it up with me some saturday... i think you'll be impressed with the studio, and even more so with marissa.  her class is extremely fun and an awesome workout all at the same time.  don't take my word for it though, come show off your moves at bricks! see you there.</u_review>
<u_review>stop #1 for the light rail pub crawl was rula bula... at least for me - and it was my first time there!  i was with my mother-in-law-to-be (joan m), and upon making our way to the back patio, we were welcomed by a huge group of yelpers.  great back patio by the way.  i had a stella and joan an irish coffee...  kate was our server and handled our group well - she did a good job considering so many peeps arriving at different times and paying separately.  only one discrepancy that i overheard but it wasn't too big a deal...  the bathroom was pretty filthy and the tp was out in one stall while the door wouldn't shut on another - not a fan of nasty bathrooms in restaurants.  enjoyable pub atmosphere and convenient location on mill ave just off the light rail.  although we didn't eat during our visit, i was impressed with the selection on the menu and based on the positive reviews that came before mine, i would totally be open to returning to eat sometime.  i'll update then!</u_review>
<b_review>total wine, oh my god, i love this place. the prices are very reasonable and the store has everything your little alcoholic heart could possibly desire. i'm not really one for cigars, but they do have a room filled with them for any cigar lovers. there are a lot of great beers here as well.</b_review>
<b_review>always a fun place to shop for beer, wine, bourbon etc...nice wine tasting - free small tastes as it should be. always find something new.</b_review>
<b_review>i swear i have a love hate relationship with this place. everytime i go to just buy one bottle of wine, i end up with at least 4?!? grrr but you can't help it. the prices are great and the wine is fabulous. bevo mo is ok but total wine rocks!!  check out their prices on all the spirits, beers, etc. you will be amazed that's for sure.</b_review>
<b_review>free tasting of camarena tequila at the entrance.  thanks for the introduction, it was pretty smooth.  btw, does anyone recall the song macarena?  the name is too close -  lol!</b_review>

<text>good food and wine = yay!  no parking = boo!  all in all, a nice place to visit on a week night.  i hear the happy hour is awesome, but i have never been during the happy hour time frame.</text>
<u_review>this place is wonderful.  my boyfriend used to work there, so it was his first choice when we went to buy plants to spice up our new patio.  we bought some really healthy plants that i can't help but be really proud of!  i've never been a plant person, but i love to gather knowledge about almost anything.  i was so impressed by the knowledge of the staff at berridge and better yet - their eagerness to share their knowledge with us.  this place gets a huge thumbs up from me!</u_review>
<u_review>second heart yoga offers affordable, pay as you go yoga classes for all levels of students.  it is not intimidating.  it is comfortable to walk in off the street and catch a class.  the teachers are very friendly.  i highly suggest that you check it out if you live in the area and enjoy yoga.</u_review>
<u_review>great coffee and helpful service.  i can definitely see myself stopping in for a relaxing saturday morning coffee and newspaper or to get specialty items for a nice meal.  it reminded me a lot of la grand orange.  i look forward to returning sometime soon. :)</u_review>
<u_review>this always has and always will be my favorite bar and it is also a wonderful restaurant.  i'm not a bar person - especially not these days, but casey's holds a special place in my heart.  i think that it has to do with the outdoor patio.  i love the space.  i like the trees and shrubbery.  it feels quite homey.  i've ordered many salads, sandwiches and burgers - and have always found the food surprisingly good.  from appearance, it doesn't look like that kind of place can put out such good food - but they do!  i suggest a late afternoon stop by for early dinner and beer.    great place!!!</u_review>
<b_review>one thing i noticed on a recent re-visit: this place is loud--both from ambient noise and the background/foreground music. and the hard surfaces and absence of carpet tend to accentuate the high frequencies. it can get kinda tedious trying to talk over it. don't let that keep you away.  just another way in which it pays tribute to its roots as synthony music all those years ago.</b_review>
<b_review>there is nothing bad to say about this place - excellent food, great service, all wine $5/ glass in the afternoon. my friends and i always make it a point to dine here (sometimes twice) when we are in the area. embiance is great, too - roll up doors make it indoor/outdoor seating. eat here, you won't regret it; in fact you'll thank me!</b_review>
<b_review>i love this place! i've been to this location several times and have yet to be disappointed. they have $5 glasses of wine until 5pm everyday (sangria on sundays) . the food is delicious!! service is great and they always have good music playing!</b_review>
<b_review>one of my favorite places in phoenix, that i don't frequent nearly enough.  great selection of wines by the glass.  the atmosphere is sexy, industrial pseudo-warehouse, i-don't-think-i'm-in-phoenix type lounge.  i think on tuesdays they have a live dj in the mix.    it's more of a wine bar than a restaurant and the menu reflects that - with the heaviest of items being their paninis.  the autostrada panini comes loaded with several meats (soppresatta and prosciutto among them) and cheeses and is amazing.  update - great service just recently.  a bit of a wait, but forgot about it because of the great servers - michelle i think, was one of them.  just had a tobin syrah that was incredible...</b_review>

<text>both food and service have suffered since the last time me and my buddies visited.  i think the staff is working too hard at socializing with the patrons.  and by patrons i mean the group of college guys in the next booth over.  ok, look - we were not jealous...all of us in my group are happily married and don't need the attention from "barbie" the waitress...(not here real name but now you know what i mean right?)  we really just wanted food & beer but apparently this place "turns into a club" at 10pm which makes me feel like "you need to leave now"....    a well deserved two star review.  enjoy your party at da club.</text>
<u_review>took my son here after school for his favorite lunch - rubios lobster tacos.  : )  this location was a bit of a hike for us but was really really worth it.  clean dining room, and larger than the average rubios that we have been to in the past.   one suggestion that is required:  baby changing table in the bathroom.  i had our infant son with us as well this day and ended up having to change him in the car.  very inconvenient when most businesses do have a changing table.</u_review>
<u_review>a very good sub!  the bread is fresh, the vegies cold, and the taste overall is perfect for a nice cold sandwich!    this location is always clean, cool, and friendly help, so worth a visit for lunch!  enjoy!</u_review>
<u_review>uhhh, can i just say it now and get it over with?  that was the dryest, chewiest, most flavorless chicken salad sandwich i have ever had served on cardboard (wheat) bread that i have ever had.    it's a basic sports bar here with all the big tv's, but seemed pretty empty today for lunch so it is obviously not a monday business lunch place.   prices were less than i expected, most menu items for lunch were from 6.25 to 11.  very reasonable, but only if they would have had some flavor!!    be sure to order a drink, you will need it to wash down that dry sandwich.  you were warned!</u_review>
<u_review>ordered the big unit and was really dissapointed this time.   when a restaurant is charging over $10 for a hot dog, it should have some flavor.  the bun was dry/stale, and the dog was barely cooked.    for that kind of money the chilli, cheese, onions, etc should all be served on the same trough that the dog comes on.  make it gourmet for pete's sake since you are charging like crazy.  also, it doesn't have to be two feet long.  nobody can eat that.  it is gross.</u_review>
<b_review>great happy hour place for fun and relaxation for co-workers .  it is pricey if you go before happy hour starts.  they occasionally have live music too if that is your bag (not mine).  but not bad for being located in the middle of nowhere.</b_review>
<b_review>i took the wife and kids here for happy hour/dinner.  we experienced friendly, great service.  they brought us a huge bucket of chips that i couldn't even finish.  the rest of the food was tasty and portions were large.    not a bad place to stop for a snack and a beer.</b_review>
<b_review>went here on two separate occasions once for dinner once for drinks. horrible.  i'll start with dinner. horrible excuse for mexican food. my husband, who loves mexican, wouldn't even finish his burrito and my enchiladas were also gross. the food had little flavor and the enchilada sauce was terrible.  for drinks, we went with some friends. our friends ordered a couple of drinks and we bought a round for them. we felt as though we were double charged. our waitress brought the manager over and he refused to let us dispute the charge. he kicked all of us out and had our check brought outside to us. they lost 4 customers for good who typically spend a lot of money over $10 worth of drinks.</b_review>
<b_review>friday night, meting a several friends for a drink. they had a live bad and the weather was great.   that was the good of it.   the server, while nice, was slooow and the drinks were weeeeak. the prices are average, which makes a bad combo.   once the band stopped and the house music started it pretty much killed the fun.   was not a fan of the food last time but neglected to eat this time.</b_review>

<text>i've been to genghis three or four times now, and each time it was delicious.    i feel i have to address a couple of the reviews that have been posted here.  first, there is nadia's odd review about how "gross" for raw meat to be bloody.  well, last time i checked, meat has blood.  apparently she prefers frozen meat over fresh meat.  to each her own, but it seems a bit absurd.  second, jennifer "reviewed" the place without having actually eaten there, which strikes me as a bit closed minded and presumptuous.  i don't have the intuition to be able to judge a restaurant based on bowl size alone, but maybe she is just more talented than i.  on to the actual review... genghis grill is great.  like i said, the meat is fresh, and there are several options: steak, chicken, turkey, pork, sausage, scallops, shrimp, cod, calamari, and probably some that i'm forgetting.  oh, and did i mention that none of it is frozen?  after the meat, you are hit with a wide array of seasoning selections (ashley mentioned that she would prefer sauces.  apparently she didn't realize that there are also sauces at the end.).  seasonings are necessary because they enhance the flavor, which is something that yc's could use.  my favorite is the cajun seasoning.  next you hit a wide variety of vegetables and other knicknacks.  there are almost too many choices; i have a hard time narrowing them down.  it also allows for different combinations; not all of your bowls have to be exactly the same each time.  finally, you get to the sauces.  these sauces actually have flavor.    you also get a choice of what you want in the bowl with the stir fry; options include noodles and fried rice.    they also have strawberry lemonade, one of the rare restaurants with such an offering.  it is true that this place costs a little more than yc's, but it's worth it.  to those who say the bowl is small, sure, it's smaller than yc's, but when you add the rice or noodles, it fills you up, and you are limited at yc's by how much crap food you can stand to stomach.  there might be better mongolian bbqs which i don't know about, but this place is legit.</text>
<u_review>i'm not sure what everybody is complaining about; our service was spectacular.  maybe you only get good service on the patio?  our waiter was friendly, attentive, and helpful.   the food?  it was great.  let's see if i can remember what we had:  pimiento piquillo con centollo (crab stuffed pepper): 4/5.  decent, but not as substantial and epic as this dish could have been.  tortilla de patatas (potato pie): too dry, a bit disappointing.  almondigas con tomate (meatball): eh. pretty typical meatball.  gambas al ajillo (shrimp with garlic and white wine): delicious.  we all agreed that it was the best shrimp any of us have had in awhile.  caracoles aioli (glazed escargots): i hadn't had escargot before.  it was a good experience, although i had to most of them myself.  probably won't order them again for risk of that happening again.  chorizo: meh.  not bad, but nothing really to it.  just sausage.  rabo de buey (oxtail): amazing.  best thing i've eaten in awhile, period.  valenciana paella: delicious.  this put the meal over the top.  because we didn't have drinks, the damage was less than $25 a pop.  and we were stuffed.  i'll definitely be back.</u_review>
<u_review>i'll start off by saying this course is a blast, and it's a good value.  it's shorter than a standard course, but it as some interesting challenges.  the most memorable hole is, i believe, the 8th hole, where you have to hit it up a large stone wall onto the green.  i've played it twice, and it was in pretty good shape both times.  the last time we played, the way the rangers handled the pace was disastrous.  they spaced the groups only about five minutes apart, which was absurd.  at one point, the group behind us was asked to move up on one of the holes, which left them justifiably angry, especially considering the bottleneck was about three groups up.  it's clear they don't know how to handle crowds there, but they can start by allowing more than five minutes between tee times, and address any bottlenecks by rushing the group that is actually playing too slowly.</u_review>
<u_review>i think people have a tendency to overrate this place because it is the only restaurant of its kind.  don't get me wrong, the pasties are great, but there are a few reasons why this place isn't a four star restaurant:  1) it's overpriced.  you're paying almost 15 bucks for a lunch originally meant for miners. 2) it's cramped.  good luck going there with more than one other person. 3) it's a little dingy.  someone said the atmosphere is great.... huh?  not sure why a dark dining room that is six feet wide and crowded can be considered a nice atmosphere, unless maybe you grew up in a sewer.  also, make sure you get there early if you want a table or food in a reasonable amount of time.</u_review>
<u_review>my favorite restaurant in gilbert.  this is my kind of bbq.  i'm a huge fan of pulled pork, and their pulled pork is perfect.  i like the pulled pork so much that i haven't been able to try any of their other meat selections, which look great as well.    on the sides frontier, their beans are excellent, as are the garlic potatoes and macaroni (real macaroni and cheese, not the box garbage).    the root beer is also a can't miss.  i'm no root beer connoisseur, but let's just say that i quit drinking soft drinks, yet always have the root beer at joe's.  if you want something different, the root beer cake is also delicious.  the best part?  the reasonable price.  a jumbo sandwich (1/3 pound), two sides, and a drink will cost you only $11-$12.  cut that to the regular sandwich and one side (a more reasonable lunch option), and you're under $10.</u_review>
<b_review>i was really confused when i first walked in.  there was no menu and i didn't notice the price on the wall for the bowls.  when i got in line, i had no idea how they were going to charge me, by weight? certain ingredients? by gender? i didn't know. no one had explained it to me.  i found out later that you pay one flat price. i made it through the process fine, got my food and enjoyed it immensely, until i noticed that they did not put in one of my ingredients! they took out the pineapple from my bowl of ingredients that i handed them. why?! what do they have against pineapples?  the waiter was very friendly, until he learned that i had a high value coupon. then he practically ignored me the rest of the time.  that was fine, because i didn't really see the point of waiters at this restaurant anyway since they don't really need to take your order. overall, the food was great, you get a lot for the price. now that i know the process, i would come back again.</b_review>
<b_review>this place kicks mongolian ass. amazing drink specials all day, including 1 dollar mimosas. i felt so bad for the poor bartender though, because he only gets the little bottles of champagne, and had to open like 200 of them in 1 day.   also, the food is good. they have tons of ingredients that most mongolian bbq's don't have, like eggs, and curry, and steak, and scallops and potatoes.  they don't have a huge noodle selection though, unfortunately. still, this place is a billion times better than yc.   booze + mongolian = awesome.  i still think it's kind of hilarious that they named a restaurant after one of the most evil people in the history of humanity. where's adolf's pub?  and you can watch jeopardy while you're eating.</b_review>
<b_review>this place is amazing!!! fresh, yes that is fresh meat, not that frozen/small meat that you get at yc's. the meat doesn't shrink like it does at yc's. you don't have to guess on the sauces and or mess around with making them. service has always been great and friendly, i think i have eaten there about 25 times in the last year and i have always been extremely happy. the drink specials are second to none. it really bothers me when people are complaining about the price, it is like 10 bucks, if you cant afford 10 bucks for a meal that you are going out for then maybe you should stay in. also people that are mad about sizes, you do know you can go back up, they are all you can eat for like a couple more bucks, but if you make it right you should never have to go back up. this place is so so good, they are busy all the time, and it is a really fun place to check out. everyone should go there!!!</b_review>
<b_review>can't say i had the food but the bar on a sunday is awesome! $1 mimosa's and watching the game = priceless, plain and simple. they had a handful of other specials ranging from draft to saki. definitely a worthwhile trip on a lazy sunday to relax and watch the game.</b_review>

<text>way too expensive! almost $3.50 for a tiny little cupcake. the vanilla has a strange flavor to it, and the chocolate isn't very good.sorry, i'm not a fan. i'll stick to my local favorite, sugarlips bakery.</text>
<u_review>go if you don't live in the desert.   if you do, or have, skip it. $18 a person ....not really worth that many dollars.  you can go to the desert or look at your own front yard.</u_review>
<u_review>this park was nice - despite the lack of trees. the other dog owners were friendly and there was plenty of water for the dogs.   con: it would be nice if all dog owners cleaned up after their furry friend....after all.....they do provide the materials to do this.  overall - we enjoyed our afternoon here.</u_review>
<u_review>above average. the korma and vindaloo were tasty. we ordered spicy, and boy, it was. whew. definately one of the better indian places in the east valley. oh, the staff was friendly but slow.</u_review>
<u_review>i like this a lot better than any of the other take out pizza in the area. this is a quick and tasty sunday night dinner.</u_review>
<b_review>a glimpse through the swinging door to the back room reveals trays and trays of unfrosted cupcakes. this immediately diminishes the sense of a an individually crafted dessert, made in small batches just for us lucky few.   the reality of sprinkles' overwhelming popularity is that the feverishly peppy girls staffing the place must crank out hundreds of cupcakes daily. it's a science and not so much an art. i much prefer art over science when it comes to food.    very few cupcakes actually have sprinkles on them. most have this hard sugar button, which confused me--is it plastic? edible?  the buttons are indeed edible.   the staff is incredibly cheery, so cheery it prompted my stone-cold death stare.  it can be quite chaotic with the paper ticket system (especially when there's a line). they completely ignore the fact that people who come in groups sometimes prefer to be helped as a group.   i purchased carrot, red velvet, and black and white cupcakes.  no time for the true experience of enjoying the cupcake in-house, and i sighed when i was handed a box to go; i guess three cupcakes isn't enough to warrant the privilege to have a bag to carry the box in.   i was surprised when i took each out of the box--they weigh a lot more than you'd expect for a cupcake.   carrot was a little generic--nothing to write home about. the cupcake cup was oily. so this is how all of those hundreds of cakes stay moist.   red velvet was super light (i finished this one in one sitting). i still want to know what flavors are in red velvet.    black and white actually had the sprinkles on it, and was my favorite; it had the perfect amount of density and the icing wasn't as over-the-top sweet as the other two.   the wooden forks and knives just didn't cut it for me (pun intended). the frosting adheres to the fork, prompting one to lick it incessantly. this creates soggy-ish wood. not delightful.  pretty good, but then again i don't eat sweets that often so i don't have much to compare the cakes to. definitely worth trying, but don't expect a life-changing experience.</b_review>
<b_review>can we say h-y-p-e?  not hype in the good way, but this place is not all that impressive.  so, i recently moved from chicago, and there are some pretty amazing bakeries there.  i've basically been in cupcake withdrawal since november, so with the general consensus saying that sprinkles was the spot...i figured why not drive to scottsdale and try it.   first and foremost, the catty service has to go.  i understand that  the employees may work/live in scottsdale and think it gives them some elite status, but the eye rolls weren't welcoming.  the women had a chip on their shoulder and couldn't answer a simple question without acting like i had disturbed their day.    i decided to move past the subpar service and focus on the prize, cupcakes.  i chose the black & white and a red velvet to take home.  honestly, it scared me that the people had to go to the back to get me my cupcakes instead of pulling them from the display case.  it felt like i was at finish line, and they had to go pull stock from the back.  i could understand that whole concept a lot better if they had just ran out of what i ordered, but there was seriously a dozen of each out in front.  why not grab those and sell them to your patrons?  anyways, i felt that the buttercream on the red velvet was mediocre.  it tasted more like vanilla than cream cheese.  a disappointment to say the least.  i'm a huge fan of red velvet, and the frosting can make or break the experience.  the black & white was far better.  dark chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream and dark chocolate shavings, but i wasn't blown away.  as far as the pricing is concerned, $7.00 for 2 cupcakes of this caliber is a little extreme.  i understand that stars frequent the sprinkles shop in beverly hills, and that the stores are placed in affluent neighborhoods because of their celebrity allure, but ugh.  i thought that was a little bit of an overkill.  i don't think that i will be returning, even if i'm desperate for my cupcake fix.</b_review>
<b_review>somehow while attempting to write an update to my original incredibly witty sprinkles review, i edited the original review in error, resulting in the loss of my original incredibly witty review, worthy of many ufc's.  now my 18 fans are stuck with my incredibly less witty new review.  believe it or not, i actually had not been to sprinkles in well over a year.  unbelievable, i know, considering i live close by.  maybe that says something.  something along the lines of i'm not really anxious to pay more for a single cupcake than it costs me to make a dozen or two at home.  but what do you do when it's august and the thought of adding any more heat to the kitchen just won't do, and yet you really need a cupcake?  well, you go stand in a line 12 deep to pay $14 for 4 cupcakes.  i've been to sprinkles maybe 4 times now, and they've been pretty consistent.  i do like their frosting, but i find the cake to be somewhat dry and flavorless imo.  and i'm always surprised by the line here.  are people that much in love with sprinkles, or is it that most of the population is not able to read the directions on a betty crocker box?  i'm not saying sprinkles is bad.  it certainly has its place in my life for a cupcake fix, particularly when i know if i make 12, i'll eat 12.  but i wouldn't go so far as to say i'm a fan.  unless they lower their price to $1, then i'll be their biggest fan.</b_review>
<b_review>i was disappointed. dry cake. no place to sit so we sat outside while it was starting to rain. i was expecting better.</b_review>

<text>oh, stingray... i have such a love/hate relationship with this place.  i *love* their happy hour: monday through friday from 3pm - 7pm. everything is dirt cheap. you could get a couple rolls and sake bombers and edamame for under $15. i love the decor/style of the place - very la.ny.sanfran'ish.   however, what good is a happy hour and restaurant fashion if the sushi is sub-par and the service is slow? this is where they lost me. the waitresses are pleasant, but it takes forever to get your food, check, water, etc.... and the restaurant won't even be slammed with customers. you can get over that, though. what you won't be able to get over is the taste/flavor of the sushi. it arrives extremely fresh, but it tastes like cardboard. i've tried almost all of them and the only one that is worth ordering is the philly roll - what does that tell you about the place? the miso soup... i love miso soup. i've never had a bad serving of it until i came here, and asked for them to take it back.   speaking of miso soup - if you sit by the bar, you'll get a complimentary bowl of it and a plate of edamame.   so, all in all - going to stingray definitely depends on your sushi standards. if you don't mind lackluster sushi and love cheap happy hour, go here. if you're a sushi snob (like myself) then spare yourself and go anywhere else.</text>
<u_review>ahhh, i wish i didn't have to leave a less than fabulous review for this place. i so wanted to love it, buttttt i can't.  let's start with customer service: it was awful. the hostess seemed annoyed. our waitress seemed annoyed. no recommendations, no smile, no checking in... to the point where we had to ask her if she was having a bad day because it was so noticeable - to which she replied, "nope." lol, oh okay....  next up, food: i ordered the chicken curry salad. he ordered the mediterranean chicken sandwich. what came out was a chicken salad, and grilled chicken wrapped in bread. we might have went wrong with our choices, but our food was absolutely bland and neither of us finished our plates. the tomato basil soup was awesome, though!  in conclusion, we both realized we are middle eastern and have probably been spoiled by arabic spices and seasonings... and therefore, this place just didn't stand a chance. it is very healthy food, though - so, if you're not middle eastern, you might enjoy this place :)</u_review>
<u_review>fabulous restaurant. went with my girlfriends for sunday brunch and it was fantastic from the moment we walked in. our waitress was incredibly friendly (and even commented on how pretty i was - major tip for her obviously). the atmosphere was relaxed with a dim setting and apparently very popular for sunday brunch (it even has its own menu). if you get to stop by, order the chicken tortilla soup or the egg benedict. delicious!</u_review>
<u_review>i never thought i'd be leaving a review for a grocery store, but last night's experience at the deli was so god-awful.   i had to pick up a few items for the house and suddenly craved fried chicken. rather than going to nasty kfc, i decided to pick some up from their deli.  the lady who takes your order is rude. she was talking to a co-worker while i was waiting to place my order, and didn't stop talking to said co-worker until i said, "excuse me - should i come back?"  then i ordered the 8 piece (for me and the family) with two sides. the sides aren't listed on the menu, so i asked her what the sides were. she proceeded to (without even looking at me) point to the right and said "there."  the sides were terrible. the mac n cheese was almost gone. no mashed potatoes. i was left with seafood salad and coleslaw. i take everything home and was so livid when i took the first bite of chicken. there was no chicken on the inside. how is that even possible? it was just burnt skin.   i would have been better off at kfc.</u_review>
<u_review>it's just not worth it to go here. the service is a hit or miss - some waitresses are helpful; some are bimbos. the food isn't that great... you can definitely find better. the inside setup... well, we had to sit outside because of it. i wouldn't go back.</u_review>
<b_review>when i was there, my friends and i actually watched a break up in action.  it was pretty sad.    aside from that, it was a great experience.  i love their drink menu.  lot's of fresh great options.  i had spice tuna rolls, and they were also very yummy.  this is a definite go to place with the ladies for saturday afternoon happy hours!</b_review>
<b_review>awesome happy hour!!!! my family and i make a trip to stingrays about once every 2 months, and we always go during happy hour.  good sushi, rolls, drinks, and even stuff for my 2 little ones that don't enjoy seafood. they have great seating indoors and outdoors, a nice bar, and we enjoy ourselves weather its a family trip or time for just me and the hubby. i would definitely recommend this location.</b_review>
<b_review>i've been here 6 times from when they opened.  the first time; was a couple weeks after they opened.  fell in love with the crispy spicy tuna; only drawback was that the soy sauce (had a lovely floral note to it; come to find out it the soap had not been rinsed out); oh well it happens.  every since then had a great experience there...from crispy spicy tuna (have to order it every time) to the drinks (love the geisha a-go-go); the sushi is good, the happy hour is great; have had everything to eat on the happy hour menu...will be back...</b_review>
<b_review>service has never been a strong suit of stingray in scottsdale, however i had high, but unfulfilled , hopes for the biltmore stingray.  by far the worst service i may have ever had.  it was a dead 3pm on a friday and we sat at the bar, and might i add, were the only customers inside! we asked for water with our beers 3 times, and had four entrees that we didn't order brought to us and nothing that we did order. to top it all off, the bartender was absent, rude as ever, and couldn't have cared less, all while the manager watched on!!! he was too busy helping entertain the numerous other servers and bartenders dancing around in the bar area doing nothing.  never going back, note: drive up the street for zen sushi instead!!!</b_review>

<text>review is for dinner/weekend - for mid-week lunch, price points and food seem good.  i live downtown, so i love new restaurants.  there are three thai restaurants within 3 walking blocks of where i live, and this is one of them.  it's frustrating that the jack up their prices so much for evening/weekend food, then complain when they are dead on the weekend.  hello!  it's downtown.  if you want to stay busy on the weekend, you should at least offer the same deals on the weekend, if not actually offer cheaper prices.  $10 bucks for minced chicken and stir fried veggies.  ordered basil plate, hot.  was medium spice at best.  i finished my plate.  it wasn't terrible.  it wasn't terribly expensive either, of course.   service was okay.  only patron at restaurant at 12pm.  i just won't be back.  i think it's the lesser of the 3 downtown thai restaurants.    again, for weekday lunch, i might very well have different review, given the value it represents with a bowl of soup, etc.  but for the price, quantity, taste... i'll frequent other restaurants first.</text>
<u_review>extraordinarily ordinary.  at here on a saturday late morning with wife and two kids.  first, there was a wait for tables, which is fine and frankly expected on the weekend at a small cafe.  but then they sat us and no waiter showed up.  once fixed, service was really marginal for the rest of the meal.    food was just okay.  wife had the turkey burger, which was just very boring and not exceptionally tasty.  i had the tryst omelet which was reasonably priced but very underwhelming in presentation and taste.  the sweet potato tater tots sounded cool, looked cool, and tasted pretty great for the first five or six in your mouth.  but there were a lot of plates i saw taken away with nearly full portions of the tots.  kids meals were just okay.  the kids burger had a patty that tasted worse than any mcdonalds or school lunch program burger i had in high school.  setting is an upscale strip mall.  inside is pleasant.  with outdoor tables and misters, this would be a terrific late fall through early spring breakfast joint if you live in the area.   food isn't terrible.  as a whole, better than a denny's.  but really nothing exceptional at all.  and the owners were nice and friendly, but they need to teach their servers better manners and to spend less time flirting with co-workers and more time focused on taking care of the customers.  i surely won't go out of my way to come back, but if i had an hour to kill for breakfast and was in the area, might give it another shot if nothing else looked better.  i mean, not every place can be a matt's big breakfast or st. francis or any of the other exceptional restaurants around town, but the food, service, and atmosphere earns this place a solid 2 stars.</u_review>
<u_review>came for mid-week lunch.    had the pulled chicken sandwich with loaded mashed potatoes, and shared a bowl of soup with someone.    soup was worst part, but it was a daily special so not to worry for future guests.  the sweet and spicy sauce was the best part.. just enough heat... probably one of the better sauces i've ever had.  chicken was pretty good as well.  good portion for the price.  mashed potatoes were pretty good.  like the way they serve it up like a baked potato, with little piles of chives, sour cream, butter and shredded cheddar.  i thought it was tasty, but my companion correctly pointed out they would be about twice as good if they were fresher and dirty red mashed versus plain.  companion had a dessert, which at $3 was good value and tasty.  would i come back?  probably.  if you want some barbeque, great place to come for a sandwich i think.   the ambience is kind of strange since its a property that has been through like 8 restaurants over the last 20 years.  this "lifetime" it's a "hooters" kind of sports bar.  tvs, comfortable booths, nice bar.  might be a good place to watch the game too... not sure if they have volume or not on sundays.  service was excellent.  friendly, attentive staff, efficient service.</u_review>
<u_review>really mediocre.  i've been here half a dozen times.  i live downtown, so like to give every restaurant downtown a fair shake.    they don't ruin anything.  setting is just okay enough to not be terrible.  service is poor, but they smile just enough to show that they are somehow trying, if misguided.  food is just tasty enough that you finish your plate.  basically, anything with pernil asado, their specialty dr. pepper slow stewed beef, is going to be good.  pretty much everything else sucks.  their nachos at 11 are small, weirdly not hot, and taste like i ordered them at an airport bar.  their drinks and beer are okay, just expensive.  basically, that is the bottom line.  if the food cost $2 bucks less per plate, it would be probably worth it as expectations would be lower.   so... eat here if you are downtown and nothing else seems to be open, but surely don't drive downtown for this place.   lots of better options in cityscape and around it.  they do have a pretty happening, cool patio on friday and saturday months during the cooler times, like mid oct.</u_review>
<u_review>food is pretty good.  drinks and appetizers are kind of expensive, compared to entrees.  i've had the enchiladas and the pollo relleno, which is creamy and really doesn't take "mexican" to me compared to the entire rest of the menu, but tasty.  in general, this places tries to be fancy gourmet, and sort of succeeds, without the "oh my god" experience you get at truly amazing places.  service is just okay both times i've gone.  crowded, but in good way, both times.  i'll keep coming back, but it's never going to be one of my favorite restaurants.</u_review>
<b_review>i wanted to like thai'd up. i really did.  you see, i love thai food. maybe a little too much, as my stomach lining can attest. i like spicy food that tastes great, therefore, i love thai food.  one of my favorite thai dishes is thai fried rice (trust me, it's better than regular fried rice). i got thai'd up's spicy fried rice, and at first bite i thought i might have a new favorite. alas, from what i could tell, the peppers were dry pepper flakes, not fresh chiles like i'm used to at my favorite thai house in san antonio. also, the flavor was inconsistent throughout the dish.  the thai tea was great. not the greatest, but it was sweet and definitely had fresh spices and herbs in it.  it was good, don't get me wrong, but it left a little to be desired. i'd give them another shot if i'm hankering for thai food while i'm downtown (i work down there, so it's highly likely). maybe next time i'll try the pad thai.</b_review>
<b_review>we went to phoenix comicon and were hungry, so we set out into downtown phoenix to look for food. there were signs for this place that said "open! come in!" so we did. and they refused to seat us! and the large group of people that came in behind us, too. it's one thing for a restaurant to let you know they're full and give you a time frame, i.e. "there's a 15 minute wait." and then get you on a list right? well the guy in this place threw his hands in the air and raised his voice, saying "we're full! i have no tables left!" and then gestured us towards the door in the "get out!" motion. i was beyond offended and pretty discouraged since a lot of the other restaurants downtown were closed for the night. either this place should have taken down the "we're open, come in!" signs, or they should have locked the door, or, they should have grown a professional bone and started a waiting list with names like every other restaurant i've ever been to! i will never bother trying to eat at this place again, for fear of being shooed away.</b_review>
<b_review>it's scorching hot outside and all i wanted to do was sit down and have a glass of water without feeling bad about taking up a seat inside of starbucks filled with people visiting for the comicon.   i've read the reviews about thai'd up before going so i expected slow service with good food. i wasn't too hungry so i figure i'd be fine waiting :) sure enough, i gotta tell ya, the service is extremely slow. they really are "thai'd up" (haha? lol)  there's only two people working the entire restaurant (this was on a saturday night at 7:00pm) one working in the kitchen and a young guy working the floor. my bf and i walked in after a group of 6 people, it was self seating so we picked a seat on the busier side of the restaurant (there's a divider in the middle) thinking we'd be more seen. we sat for about 10 minutes before being asked what we'd like to drink and we ordered our waters, which was delivered in a timely manner, we didn't get to order for another 20 minutes. (but remember, i wanted this, i knew this was going to happen. remind you, if i were hungry and wanted my food in a timely manner i would be upset just like everyone else, some even walked out). after we finally got to order it took another 20-30 minutes for the food to arrive and it really was delicious!   now to the food part: 1. tom kah (tofu) soup -- delicious! loved it! perfect amount of spice and the yummy coconut milk soup! amazing! my bf got the chicken version and said the same :)  2. summer rolls -- eh, you really can't go wrong. it's just rice noodles and lettuce / shredded carrots / cucumber wrapped in rice paper. it was still good!   that's all we ordered but the table next to us had ordered the crab rangoons and said they were delicious along with their thai fried rice.   i'll be back again another time when i'm not toooo hungry to try their other dishes :) just remember, don't go there starving and you'll have a fun time people watching!  ps- he did give me a free soup bc it took so long, so that's what earned their third star! lol</b_review>
<b_review>the food is far better than the service. ate dinner there recently and had spring rolls appetizer and a wok entree. total was ~$20. the food was very good...fresh, well prepared, and more than enough. medium spicy was terrific...had a good zest, but not overpowering. if i were rating the food alone, i'd give the place 4 stars.  but, the service was quite bad. i was directed to sit at a booth by a waitress and it took nearly 5 minutes for someone to come by and ask me if someone had taken my order. nope...didn't even have a menu. then, the appetizer and the entree came out together, but without rice. i had to flag someone down to ask for rice, and the waitress looked at me like asking for rice in a thai restaurant was somehow really odd. then, no refill on my drink was ever offered. in fact, after the rice was brought out, i never had contact with anyone again until someone put a check on my table as they walked by. then, it took another 5 minutes to get my charge slip returned, at which point i had to walk up to the register to get a pen to sign the receipt. it was comically bad, really...maybe they were trainees, i'm not sure. so, 2 stars for service, giving an average of 3 stars.  my recommendation:  hit this place up for take-out.</b_review>

<text>my parents love this place. they ranted and raved about how great it was so when my mom invited me to go there for a girls night, i was happy to try it out.  the restaurant itself is gorgeous. fake trees covered in lights...the whole nine yards. i hear they have live music on the weekends. the stage was beautiful.  everything was pretty expensive but i don't mind spending $15 on a meal if it's worth it. i ordered the vegetarian enchiladas and a margarita.   the margarita was alright. nothing too special. definitely not a twelve dollar margarita. as for the food, well it was horrible. my enchilada had cinnamon on it. cinnamon. it didn't say that it would have cinnamon on the menu. i hate cinnamon. i was really polite about it when i mentioned it to the waitress and she said, "well authentic mexican food usually has cinnamon on the main dishes."  excuse me? my last name is montoya and i was running around in diapers eating fresh tortillas before this waitress was even born. my family visits mexico multiple times a year and i was raised on homemade mexican food. not once ever has there been cinnamon in it. i wouldn't have been mad about the cinnamon if she hadn't said that. it is not authentic mexican food. i have no idea what she was thinking.  if you like overpriced 'mexican' food that tastes nothing like mexican food and love dessert spices on your enchiladas, then i'd suggest coming here!  stick to the bar for the atmosphere because it's lovely but avoid the food at all costs.</text>
<u_review>i was so happy to see a charleys pop up in arizona! for some reason we're like the only state that doesn't utilize this amazing quick restaurant.   the thing about charleys is that it's always been kind of expensive but the fries alone are worth it!  this location seems to be a classic case of lost in translation. their fries aren't nearly as good as any other charleys that i've ever been to and their sandwiches can't even compare. the service is really fast compared to other locations because it's pretty much a ghosttown.  someday i'll get a great charleys experience without leaving the comfort of my home. someday :{</u_review>
<u_review>normally when i go to a restaurant i'm not annoyed when i'm given a kids menu. it's kind of a compliment since i'm twenty-four and a little sensitive about my age due to having a younger boyfriend.   however, when i came here with my family the other day the hostess placed a kids menu down for me and thus began the silliest most awkward situation ever. my usual response is to just push it aside where my little brother is seated. well when i did this the hostess promptly put another one down for me. this was so silly to me and my mother that we both laughed (in a non-rude way) the hostess then looked at me as if i were a naughty child and said, "oh would you like a grown up menu??" there wasn't even a hint of playfulness in her voice. she was serious.  just about everyone heard. normally i'm a pretty polite customer but i just rolled my eyes and mumbled, "yes, i'm twenty-four."  she didn't apologize and actually never brought me my own menu. i had to share with my mommy!  that hilarious story aside, the food is pretty good and reasonably priced. their margaritas are buy one get one during happy hour so after a few of those the age situation was easily forgotten. my entire family ordered steak and said it was houstons grade steak at applebees price. i ordered fish and it was pretty good. they didn't charge me when i asked for a vegetable skewer instead of fries even though the skewer is more expensive on the menu.  oh and also, i can throw my peanut shells on the floor. i feel like fucking royalty. the end.</u_review>
<u_review>my boyfriend and i have been going to ichiban constantly for sushi for the past two years. we love it. they know us and always greet us with complimentary edamame and sometimes even soup. at the end they even bring us fruit!  ever since half price sushi, there's just no reason for us to ever go anywhere else for sushi. we love it.  as far as the cooking tables, i'm not a fan. i like cooking tables at other places but ichiban is a much better sushi restaurant. the cooks are friendly and creative and entertaining but the food itself is just sub-par and the prices are a little high.   all in all an amazing sushi place but i wouldn't suggest going for the hibachi tables.</u_review>
<u_review>finally a paradise bakery near me! i don't have to drive all the way to scottsdale for them anymore! no longer will my family be forced to make an adventure across the other side of town to pick up my cookie cake because i hate real cake!   right?  wrong. this paradise bakery just plain sucks. i still order my cookie cakes and cookies from here because it's convenient but i would never eat their food. i've tried eating here twice. once an albacore sandwich that tasted like someone died inside of it (not the fish). the second time was just pasta salad. how do you mess up pasta salad? tell me. another time my cousin ordered tomato soup and she found what we presumed to be part of a plastic spoon inside of it. how does that even happen? are they intentionally messing with us or did they really just serve us used soup?  this location is always packed. i've never come here and not had to wait in line for at least ten minutes. that and the employees (besides one old lady who works there) are total jerks. i'm serious. dude you work at paradise bakery for a living. don't talk down to me when i'm trying to order a cookie.   i only come here to get my mr pibb fix or to buy my mom cookies. their cookies are just as good as any other paradise. i have no idea what happened to their food or who trained their employees.</u_review>
<b_review>i've wanted to try this place for a while, so i finally talked my boyfriend into going before a movie. he was reluctant because he had been to another location and felt it was just "so,so".  well he was right.  when we walked in the host and hostess seemed confused, as to what we might be doing there... um we would like a table, please!  so they looked at the computer and at each other and decided to sit us at a two top table which shared a bench with a family with young kids, meanwhile the restaurant was about 80% empty.  the service was okay, but we had to wait about 20 minutes for our check which was a little annoying.   we would have gladly ordered another beer while we were waiting for it, but we were never asked.  as for the food, the chips and salsa were decent and my veggie enchiladas were good.  i don't really have anything to complain about, it just didn't blow me away in one direction or another. if i could give it a 2.5 i would.</b_review>
<b_review>beautiful decor.  good sangria.  excellent duck tacos, or was i just very hungry?  i must've been since i remember enjoying the rice and beans... tried my friend's enchilada... did not care for it.  thought that my duck tacos were much more flavorful.  friend thought opposite.   if i were a drinker (i'm not), i'd come here for the sangrias and the atmosphere.  it's very sexy, yet not intimidating, in here.</b_review>
<b_review>at first maria maria seemed like a cool concept. but after listening to an hour and a half of nothing but santana's music, it can start to grate on your nerves...   the place was about half full, though we still had to wait about 20min for a table. the decor is nice and our server was pleasant. chips and salsa were above par (with three types served by default). we ordered the chicken fajitas and a mexican salad. both were good, but nothing to really rave about.  maria maria seemed like more hype than substance to me.  what is with people bringing young children into a place like this? the decor should be a hint that this is not a mcdonald's playland. the rule i heard awhile back that stuck with me is "that the menu price should match the childs age". for example at mcdonalds you can get a kids meal for under $3... good for 3-year olds and up. at denny's you can eat for about $10, and at a place like maria maria a really cheap bastard can get away with about $15. what a simple and elegant formula for parents to follow... (i grant an exemption to parents of extremely well behaved children).</b_review>
<b_review>who told carlos santana to open a restaurant chain? between his god-awful shoe collection (apparently designed exclusively for hookers and the colorblind) and his collaborations with rob thomas (is that guy still around?), i would have thought he was pretty busy. but nope, no such luck.  enter maria maria, conveniently located at our newest soon-to-be-rundown fake-urban mall, tempe marketplace. it is, of course, a chain. but you knew that. it's pretty inside, though, and arguably less crass than some of its neighbors (*cough* lucille's *cough*).   work lunch. not my choice, but i'm game. wait, how much for some enchiladas? $17? and no lunch menu? you've got to be fucking kidding me, hombre. i'm all for nuevo mexicano but we are at the goddamned mall, carlos. and that's a lot of dinero for some tortillas and beef.   the food was...fine. not gross, just boring as hell. the guacamole was pretty good, but considering its size (not huge) and price (i forget - maybe $10) it wasn't memorable. if you're prepared to go the pricey guac route, just go to los sombreros instead.  when it comes to maria maria, i think carlos said it best: "just forget about it."</b_review>

<text>i really don't think i'm the target audience for a place like this.  i understand what they're going for with these artisan pizzas but i really would just like a little sauce on my pizza.  just a little...  the flavors are usually good but the lack of any sauce and more often than not over cooked dough make it hard for me to want to keep coming back to places like this.</text>
<u_review>my job will order catering from chompie's a few times a year but until i saw this restaurant featured on man vs. food i never thought to visit.  i've been a couple times now and i've enjoyed it both times.  the staff was friendly, the food is good and enjoy the pickles a lot!  while i've had many different items from their menu when they have catered for my work i've only had the jewish sliders in their restaurant and i really enjoy them.  the normal serving is too much food for me so i always end up with some left overs for later.  thankfully they still taste great after spending some time in the fridge.</u_review>
<u_review>i think this is one of those places i'll need to visit a few more times to get a real feel for the place.    the bacon cheese fries where really good however the hurricane didn't seem like it had very much kick to it.  perhaps it was only a tropical storm?  it's pretty close to home so i'm sure i'll be headed here again.</u_review>
<u_review>it was very low key last night at sochu house.  when our group of 9 showed up i think we easily doubled the number of people present.  i had the clay pot with tofu and was blown away by the flavor and texture of the curry sauce and the tofu was cooked perfectly.  i really liked the reverse happy hour as well.    i plan on going back for a meal in the near future.</u_review>
<u_review>it's me, not you.  you didn't do anything wrong la bocca.  you treated me very well.  always did what you could to make me happy.  i'm just in a place in my life where i need to see other pizza joints.    i'm sure you'll find someone who likes you exactly the way you are.</u_review>
<b_review>ok i guess i just don't get it.  i was really looking forward to a pizza extravaganza.  afterall, how could oprah, martha stewart, and my hero rachel ray be wrong about something as simple as a pizza??? my boyfriend and i happened to be off on a monday afternoon and so we made the drive up here to check this spot out.  this location is hard to find.  we even looked it up beforehand and called for directions.  in the 110+ temperatures we were all but about to give up finding it and head over to potbelly's (which would have been better in hindsight) when we finally came across what i had thought to be a pizza oasis.  it was a mirage. we were seated promptly and given 4 small olives which were delicious, but it would be nice to have some bread and olive oil as well.  i mean, after all most people wait hours just to get in the door to this place.  i also thought the service was just ok.  no one went out of there way to recommend anything to us or even seem really friendly at all. the food did come quickly though and the topping were really good.  the fennel sausage was flavorful, the mozzarella fresh, and the basil was very tasty as well. it's the crust though that kills it for me.  yes i am not an idiot and i know what brick oven crust tastes like.  it is typically charred and the crust is thin and chewy. normally i really enjoy it, but here the middle was actually soggy.  it's a small pie, which is ok, but that crust was really bland and wet.   also again i would love to have the olive oil and parmesan to dip the crunchy ends in.  sorry guys i just don't get it.  i have had better brick oven pizza at dozens of places in chicago and i hafta say to all my foodie heroes i have been let down.</b_review>
<b_review>part of me knew this before i took my first bite but, this just doesn't live up to the hype.  i mean, nothing really could live up to the hype built around this place! to be fair, it is great pizza.  i just isn't "the best pizza".  there are numerous places in san francisco that would beat this one out.  upon entering the restaurant, at noonish on a sunday, we were surprised to see it half empty.  i was also surprised to be cheerfully greeted by chef chris himself!  for how slow the restaurant was, our table service was also slow.  we did get some yummy olives to eat while we waited, nice touch.  our favorite pizzas were the sausage and the red onion/pistachio (i forget the names).  i would actually skip the famous margarita, i didn't think the flavor of the cheese or the sauce really shined through.  i think if i went back i would try one of their pasta dishes.  they serve a small entree menu, in addition to the pizzas, at this location.</b_review>
<b_review>how many years has it been?  i dunno, but i finally made it to pizzeria bianco and i didn't have to wait 2 hours for a pie.  i think i understand why.  when the wife found there was a bianco now at town and country, we decided late on a saturday afternoon to give it a whirl.  just a short drive down the road and after a few minutes of arguing about where the best parking-lot shade is, we found ourselves being quickly seated at biancos.  it's located practically in the center of tc mall, in a glass-walled front that has hosted many places over the years.  a huge, round wood-fired oven is prominently displayed in the tiny prep area, for all to see.  i was there with the wife and daughter, and we wanted pizza.  perusing the short menu, indeed, we found pizza.  we also found a homemade sangria and local sunup ale on tap.  kudo's.  the daughter got a coke in a bottle.  we ordered a margherita, biancoverde and a wise guy.  drinks were delivered quickly.  my beer was delicious with a crispy light finish, perfect for washing down the pizza.  my wife was served a tiny glass, like child's tea-party size, chock full of ice and fruit, stained purple from the sip of sangria included.  this begrudgingly sized glass of sangria was nine dollars.  the pizza was delivered quickly and we all set to our dishes.  the margherita was the tastiest looking, all green and red and white in a traditional looking pie.  the wiseguy was a white pizza, which translates to no sauce, cheese, sausage and grilled onions, and the biancoverde was another white pizza, covered in fresh arugula, spread over mozzarella, ricotta and asiago, a very rich and oily pizza.  for me, the true test of a pizza is determined the day after, eating the cold leftovers for breakfast.  i'm happy to say that the buttery crispy-chewy crust is delicious the day after.  the fresh mozzarella and the mild sausage from my pie was a good combination, even if a bit salty.  i'm kind of a traditionalist, liking a red sauce to moisten the pie, and having a pizza without is definitely not something i would do again.  but that is just me.  the pies really are delicious, and different.  the service is excellent.  then why only two stars you ask?  grossly overpriced.  $18 for a pie better get you something that is so damn good you would have no reason to ever consider another pie again.  unfortunately for me, when i think of the best pie i've had in recent years, grimaldi's comes to mind.  bigger, cheaper and tastes better.  sorry chris, but that's reality.  the biggest insult was the thumbnail-sized glass of what must be liquid sangria gold.  it didn't taste that great and unless you like ice chips, it is so not even a fair deal.    so i finally got to try bianco's.  i'm glad that i did, only just to get it off my list.  three words to describe it, pricy, overrated and pricy.  i'll not be back.</b_review>
<b_review>one time i waited over 3 hours to eat at the pizzeria bianco downtown....well, thank god those days are over. this new location is nice because there isn't usually a wait and they have the same menu as the other location....plus it's right by my yoga studio (cuz after yoga, i need some pizza...duh!). i went with my mom and we shared their super simple salad, which was good, but plain with just a light vinaigrette, and we had a half bianco verde half rosa pizza. the pizza was soooo good. better than i remember from the other location (the lack of the wait time may have helped too). i like that these pizzas are very different than others in phoenix....local pistachios on a pizza? come on! is it the best pizza in town? no...but it's definitely worth a try!   ps this may sound really dumb, but i had some leftovers and later that night i popped them in the micro in the plastic container and the container melted to the pizza...i was pretty devastated, so don't be dumb like me....safety first, use a plate :-p</b_review>

<text>this restaurant really does it right!  really good food and great service!  we started with the beet salad and just had to try a small tomato soup, both of which were absolutely delicious!  we also split the hummus, which was probably one of the best hummus dips i've ever had.  then we shared the crispy eggplant sandwich and it did not disappoint one bit.      we totally enjoyed our whole experience at phoenix city grille.  the service couldn't have been any better.  the gal was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  i highly recommend this restaurant and i can't wait to return to try other items on their menu.</text>
<u_review>we attended this restaurant for an early seating at 5 p.m. and were immediately impressed with the atmosphere and professional staff.   both were first class.  we decided to sit at the counter overlooking the chefs preparing the food and we were glad we did.  one young fellow was more than happy to answer any questions we had regarding the preparation as well as the presentation of the food.  it really was fun to watch the whole process.  we decided to go straight to the entree instead of filling up on an appetizer beforehand and we were glad we chose to do that.  we each ordered the kobe vaca encebollada, which was a grilled kobe skirt steak nestled on a bed of caramelized onions.  alongside the steak were three slices of potato about a half inch thick and these were topped with a guacamole type mixture as well as other toppings.  they were absolutely delicious and i was so sad to reach the end of those.  the steak was cooked to absolute perfection and i was determined to clean my plate because it, too, was just so scrumptious!  it was a very ample portion and we did clean our plates and definitely had no room for dessert, unfortunately.  as our cocktail, we followed another reviewers lead and ordered virgin mojitos, which were $9.50/ea and they were delicious and also sufficed as a dessert stand-in so the tab wasn't too crazy at all.  well worth it for that delicious steak.  we did dress up for the occasion and were glad we did as everyone was dressed casually but nice.  it's fun to have the whole experience for a special night out.    we look forward to returning soon.</u_review>
<u_review>we went for a flick on christmas eve and what a nice experience.  the food was delicious (buffalo chicken rolls, super-good flatbreads, delicious truffle fries, yummy cheesecake) and the seats were better than home!  we booked ahead and reserved the recliners because not only are they comfortable but they have little blankets and pillows there for one's use.  the servers are very attentive and do a really good job, considering they have to go up and down the stairs a gazillion times.  they even brewed us fresh decaf which made the experience even better because we were able to sip coffee (good coffee) as we watched the movie.  i highly recommend this theatre.  also, don't forget about the free (except for the tip, of course) valet parking.  very handy!</u_review>
<u_review>this was our second visit to this restaurant and we were glad we gave it another shot because we weren't too crazy about our first visit.    we had ribs the first time and we found them too smoky.  this time we tried the pulled pork sandwiches and they were really good.  the only problem was that the bottom bun was totally and completely soggy but the top wasn't too bad.  the pork itself was really good and i must mention the fries - oh baby!  they were so good!  sometimes fries don't really taste like much of anything but these fries tasted like they just dug them out of the garden - they had that much potato flavor.  what a treat!    i agree that there are better barbecue restaurants around but this restaurant is definitely worth stopping at if you're in the neighborhood and have a craving for a pulled pork sandwich (with fries, of course).</u_review>
<u_review>this was only our first visit but it was so good that i had to give them a five star rating.    we each had the traditional burrito, which they kindly substituted egg whites for the eggs.  the burrito had a thick layer of eggs, along with melted cheese and a layer of potatoes and the tortilla wrap was fresh and warm.  it was so good.  they served salsa along with it and it was such a great addition.  we both ate almost the whole thing and that's saying something because the portion is decent.  i always try to leave a little of whatever but it was hard not to finish each and every little bite of that wrap!  we also each had a decaf americano and those were fantastic.  decaf is often so bitter but this was one smooth cup of coffee.    we're returning tomorrow to try something else.  that's the plan now but it's going to be hard not to repeat today's selection.  we'll see.  *returned the next day and i had the same thing but my husband had the az burro that was similar to the traditional burrito but had smoked turkey, avocado, egg whites, hash patty, tomato & feta, wrapped in a sundried tomato tortilla and he said it was very good.  mine was as good as the first time i had it.  but next time i think i'll try the oatmeal.  it's made with organic quinoa, vanilla macaroon granola, maple syrup, fruit and steamed milk.  that definitely sounds good!</u_review>
<b_review>one of my favorites, eat here all the time. locals restaurant. great service, friendly and efficient servers. food is exceptional from the steak tacos to the burgers and daily specials. the owner sheldon is always there which is why it is so successful. ask for amy, jose,becca or natalie. sunday brunch is great too. wish i could give it more than 5 stars. the best of the best!!!!!!!</b_review>
<b_review>i've noticed that as my solidly senior parents get older their taste in food gets pickier.  due to this, every time i decide to treat them to a meal, i really have to put a ton of thought into it.  i've struck out many times, but hit one out of the field with phoenix city grille.  goat cheese toasts started the show.  the cheese was delicious, with the sun dried tomatoes really giving some depth  entrees ordered were the pot roast, pasta and an amazing porkchop special.  the pot roast was exactly what i craved, dare i say needed.  it took all the self control i could muster to save some for leftovers (pot roast sandwich the next day, of course).  the chop was devoured in a frenzy by my normally mellow dad, while my mom eagerly sopped up the pasta sauce.  i still tend to over think meal planning with the family, thankfully phoenix city grille has given me a solid option.</b_review>
<b_review>this is a great date spot. it is elegant but not to posh nor will the price leave to bad a taste in your mouth if things don't sizzle after dinner. the lighting is dim so it has a touch of romance to it. you can hear each other talk, small detail. i love good service and this is one place that i have always had great service. i have actually only had great everything here. the food is nothing super fancy or exotic but it is always good, if you order a steak med-rare that is the way it will come out. i enjoy all the apps, in fact i love going for happy hour and just having apps. the location is central and easy to get to, and it is always packed so you might have to wait so grab a drink for the bar and enjoy the scents flowing from the kitchen.</b_review>
<b_review>we were visiting phoenix and needed somewhere to share an easter dinner. found the phoenix city grille on yelp. it's high marks are spot on. the staff was very helpful and friendly. they maintain a family run atmosphere (working in a family biz  i appreciate that) and the food was perfect. even some of our more picky eaters were excited about their meals. we had six very satisfied diners. it is always a good sign to leave a restaraunt feeling elevated by the experience. p.s. the corn cakes really are incredible!</b_review>

<text>decided to go here on a whim because they have a clever name.  turns out that's really all they have going for them, besides the cold beer.  the food was forgettable, the atmosphere was bleh the service was slow and the decor was like a failed attempt at applebee's.  needless to say, i won't be going back any time soon.</text>
<u_review>i'm not what you would call a huge fan of french cuisine.  that doesn't mean i can't appreciate delicious when it hits my lips.  i didn't really know what to expect from this place, other than i was fairly certain i could get some duck confit or a croissant.  i was right, but they have a lot more.  sadly, i came near closing time, so many of their savory options were gone.  but, i was able to snag some of their macaroons and a madeline.  i guess their macaroon flavors rotate all the time, but the blueberry one i had was easily the finest macaroon i've had to date.  couple this with a very european feel inside & very friendly service, and this was a nice change of pace.  i will go back, if nothing else, to try one of their savory croissants - and possibly some of their other fresh items that frankly wouldn't travel well in 110 degree heat.  this place is unique and if you're in the area, definitely check it out!</u_review>
<u_review>it's tough to be impartial after all the hype this place got, but alas, i wasn't that impressed.  i think part of the problem with the ambiance is the squawk factor.  it felt like the majority of the patrons there thought they were filming an episode of sex & the city.  that said, it's only a minor drawback.    we got the olives, as an appetizer, and they delivered.  the prices on their wine / beer selection were reasonable and also spot on.  the bruschetta is their specialty - and two of the four we chose were really good.  i will say, that quite possibly, the best thing they serve is their blt bruschetta - way good and something i will crave.  the classic (mozzarella / basil / tomato) needed a little more balsamic & a little less salt.  the brie / apple just needed more brie and it would have been amazing.  the prosciutto / fig one was just forgettable.  we got the roast beef sandwich on ciabatta to share, and here lies the bulk of the trouble.  the bread had good flavor, but it felt like it had fallen in a tub of dust prior to being served (too much excess flour).  the sauce was cloyingly sweet, and their chips were soggy and tasted like they had been cooked ten hours prior.  the service was just fine - and if we had stumbled upon this place, without all the hype / build up, it probably would have deserved a four.  so, if we go back, it will be for their monday / tuesday night special - which is four of their bruschettas + one bottle of wine for $20 - tough to beat.</u_review>
<u_review>sadly, there's only one thing consistently good at this place - the parmesan garlic fries (extra crispy)... the burgers are hit and miss - and that's just a shame.  last night i tried the ghost chili sauce + jalapeno burger, and if i hadn't added bacon to it, i wouldn't have been able to finish.  bland, flavorless, and greasy.  just go somewhere else for a burger, for the love of cow.</u_review>
<u_review>i think i'm gonna have to come back here for a happy hour.  i can't give it a five, because the tacos just didn't merit a five... that said, the chips and salsa were spot on, as well as the carne asada quesadilla.  i love the ambiance and decor, and the service was really good.  in regards to the tacos, the main factor for me is the tortilla.  you can tell they were made fresh, but they were dry and a little bland.  they were white corn, which was cool, but i think the massa needed a little something.  i guess it was just meh - and when your joint is named after something specific, you should try to knock that outta the park.  will i go back?  yeah, but i'm not in a hurry to do so.</u_review>
<b_review>quick review and will expand more later because i've only been here once, but the hungry monk offers a great, great, great bacon cheese burger that was just out of this world. will update once we've made a return trip and tried more on the menu, but if you're a burger fan, add hungry monk to your "must try" list.</b_review>
<b_review>usually a great experience, great food and a great staff. the wings are delicious and plenty of craft beers to choose from. my girlfriend and i, along with our friends are regulars here. we go every tuesday night and saturday night for trivia. tonight it was made known to us (by the very friendly and nice gm) that other teams thought we were cheating! it's the first time i've been made to feel unwelcome in one of my favorite establishments in chandler and i'm really disappointed it's come to this. i come to eat great food, and have fun. not to be made to feel unwelcome and accused of cheating on an unimportant game. kudos to the gm for being so nice about it, but i'm really disappointed in the experience tonight. it may be a while before we come back. the only people that are to blame are the fellow patrons of the hungry monk. relax and lighten up, people.  on the plus side, as i stated before, the food and beer are great, and the atmosphere (when no one is accusing you of cheating during a trivia game) is fun and pleasant. the staff are always attentive, and we've grown very fond of a few specific staff members.   would have been five stars but i'm feeling really unwelcome there at the moment. again, this is no reflection of the staff or food, but rather all of you, my fellow patrons. you should be ashamed of yourselves.</b_review>
<b_review>take out exp - been a fan of hungry monk back when the name was buffalo wings rings and things!! i loooove the food their! especially the chicken strips for a buck on thursdays! i have not ate in but i have done take out almost every week for the past year and the service is getting worse and worse. i call and tell them separate orders, and they put them all on the same ticket. one of the sauces is usually wrong and instead of grilled they will give me regular fried chicken. they stopped honoring my company's 15% discount... i did go every week!!!</b_review>
<b_review>i've driven by this place before, thinking the name was catchy, but after reading the reviews on yelp, it looked like i had a 50/50 shot of it being money well spent so i didn't make it a priority to try this place.  however, my husband has a couple of coworkers who just love the joint, so yesterday we decided to give the h.m. a try.    we liked that the drink menu is already at the table so we could look it over and decide what we wanted.  there's a nice representation of the local brews and then a good variety of out-of-towners mixed in.  our server, kelsey, was at the table a couple of minutes after we sat down and took our drink order.  this was about noon on a sunday.  not too busy and she was fairly quick, friendly, and attentive with her service.  the only time she was slow was in bringing us the check.    i had their ribs with a side salad and their house made chips.  right away i was impressed with that salad.  it's the little things, i know, but it's nice to have crisp dark romaine that's not in pieces the size of an umbrella.  the salad also had fresh mushrooms, tomato, cuke, onion, and what looked like homemade croutons.  i don't use much dressing, but the honey mustard was nice.    the ribs were bone in and very tender and flavorful.  i will definitely get cravings for them, and the house made chips were tasty too.  i like the touch of the herbed parmesan on top.  i got a huge pile of them with my meal and we brought home half of them.  my husband ordered the swiss shroom burger medium rare with sweet potato fries.  his meal is the first reason i gave 3 stars instead of 4.  both items were over cooked.  not to the point that they were inedible, but that burger was a second away from well-done and dry.  the bun was a little dry too.  i really think san tan and blu burger grille have the smoky flavor and bun down to a science.  someone from the hungry monk should go check out their burgers and learn from it.  they are close to getting the burger right at the h.m. because i can tell they like a big burger topped with fresh ingredients, it's just not quite there yet.  the sweet tater fries were ok, but mostly crispy critters.  some of that is fine, but they were all almost like little matchsticks.    the other factor that dropped them to 3 stars was it was almost uncomfortably warm in there.  i know it's july in phoenix and the recent rain has ratcheted up the humidity, but i couldn't feel any air moving in the place.  i don't know if they are trying to save a few bucks or if the a/c is struggling.  i probably won't be back til it cools off outside, but i will definitely be back.  there were a couple of other items on the menu that looked interesting, it's close to home, and they have a very good drink selection.</b_review>

<text>fantastic foodgasm!!! i'll run out of superlatives trying to describe their latest masterpiece - the best sandwich i've had in ages! the new york dog: beef weiner with hot pastrami, melted swiss, and creamy-tangy coleslaw! http://s3-media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tgla9qvuulsxqg5m7d3cvq/l.jpg    best paired with butterscotch root beer. so glad rocket burger is in my neighborhood!! :d</text>
<u_review>there are two large enclosures here: one for larger dogs and another for smaller ones. although i have no dogs of my own, i had a chance to experience using them both during my swim team's "dog day at the park" last weekend. my teammates and i were in the "big dogs" enclosure, playing with the big critters they brought when one of my teammates arrived with his dachshund and his chocolate lab. since  he couldn't have both animals in one enclosure, i volunteered to bring the little wiener dawg into the enclosure for smaller (below 20 lbs) dogs. both enclosures were very spacious and clean, and the pet owners who we met were very friendly and shared plastic bags and even water for other dogs if needed. lots of parking, and the whole park complex itself was quite nice - well-maintained and very spacious.</u_review>
<u_review>good food, though i didn't find any of the dishes outstanding, and there were not as many offerings as i would have expected for a super buffet. the variety of dishes was pretty much what you would expect for an above-average chinese buffet. the staff was very friendly, the restaurant spacious, and the meal was inexpensive and satisfying - a good meal at a good price.</u_review>
<u_review>inexpensive chinese buffets rarely merit a very high rating, but this one deserves it. although not located in a choice area of phoenix, this establishment is clean, has a very efficient staff, and serves really good food - definitely better than in many of the good buffet establishments i have tried. i joined rand h. for lunch here at opening day and was impressed by the appealing interior decor and the wide array of tasty choices which includes mongolian grill (they have killer mini-kebabs), sushi, clams in ginger-jalapeno broth, as well as many of the staples in chinese buffets but very nicely seasoned here. i'm definitely returning so that i can have some of the dishes i wasn't able to try because i ran out of tummy room - even though i had only a small tasting portion of each dish i tried. that's the happy consequence of having such a wide variety of good food available. and all that for just $6.99 + tax, for lunch.</u_review>
<u_review>since pho thanh was closed today (tuesday, their day off) i decided to give da vang another try. this time i ordered the rice vermicelli with grilled pork and shrimp paste slices. the dish was good but the service was slow, especially since i came here mid-afternoon, way after the lunch rush was over. so next time i need my vietnamese food fix and it's a day other than tuesday, i'll be headed for the nearby  pho thanh; for me, it has better food,  faster service, and more generous portions.</u_review>
<b_review>this place rocks and is so affordable. they have the best sandwiches in town and the gyro is sooo good. you can get one of their delicious sandwiches for less than $5. unbelievable!! and all of those soda choices!!!!!!!! i wish you were closer to my house because i would go there all the time!!</b_review>
<b_review>just gotta say yummy... so good it tickles... dw, my son, got the terriaki burger... ummmm really??? with a fried pineapple slice.... let's just talk about the housemade terriaki sauce... and not your typical bun either... listen... don't get me wrong... its a burger joint... but it's not 'just' another burger joint... after all the 'taste is outta this world'... and the fries... exceptional!!!   on to the cherry... they probably have over 200 different sodas... old school favs and some new school stuff... everything from virgil's root beer... to the ever natural oogave drinks... they even have one called dog snot and kitty pittle (not feeling that adventurous today)... creamy deliciousness...   whether it's next door to you... or across town... it is definitely worth the ride...</b_review>
<b_review>the area is pretty sketchy, but the burger was great.  there were tons of interesting menu items and i wish i could try each one, but i went with the standard cheese burger.  of course i had to get it "rocket" style though.  the burger plus an order of fries could have easily been a challenge on man vs. food.  with that said i couldn't finish the fries and burger which is a rarity for me.  for about ten bucks it was a pretty good value and well worth it.  the burger was well seasoned, cooked perfectly and wasn't greasy.  the bun held up great so i didn't make a mess of my shirt as is almost always the case when i have a burger.  i will definitely return because the eddie lopez burger has my name all over it!</b_review>
<b_review>10% off with yelp check in!!! there is an amazing selection if soda pop. it makes my gf crazy when i call it pop. location is not the best, but i never felt like i was in immediate danger. good staff. clean. yummy stuff. if you are loitering around 35th ave and cactus, this is the place for you.</b_review>

<text>i expected soooo much more! i am almost heart broken...kind of.  the meat lovers scramble was to die for...so why only 2 stars? the amount of food given i could have gotten double at my favorite breakfast spot for the price paid. they scramble maybe like 1 or 2 eggs and throw in some meat but it just did not seem like a reasonable price for how little was on my plate and i paid extra for a slice of french toast. if i would have known that the french toast wasn't as amazing as some people make it to be they do not know mouth watering french toast like i do. if you are craving french toast go to crackers and co. not scramble!  if i go to scramble again i would stick with the toast and potatoes with the scramble but i might try something else next time.  then update my review. but for now i am sticking with the two stars for the taste of the meat lovers scramble.  i love how many hot sauces they had so it will give me more to experiment with next time.  their rosemary potatoes are so much better than wildflower bread company whose are way too salty for my taste.    service was decent even though its not a real sit down place where people constantly check to see how you are doing. so service in general too me wasn't anything out of this world over the top status.  the place itself was clean and comfortable. but not for a long period of time. :) until then i wasn't so disappointed that i will never go again i am just not fond of how little food you get or think you will get for how much you spend. for $8 you get mostly bread and potatoes. awesome right?  :|   :\</text>
<u_review>they burnt the hell out of my toast i was looking forward to eating ever so much! i couldn't believe it! so upsetting. to go to a location specifically for the bread and to have them burn it. :(  i highly doubt i'll be back to this location again if they want to burn peoples toast.</u_review>
<u_review>i wouldn't say i am a liberty market fan quite yet. i ordered two orders for work one day hoping to be amazed and in complete awe in every bite i took. this was not the case.  my first order was the scramble with italian sausage, mozzarella, and i believe sun dried tomatoes because they were a little too sweet for my liking. it was mediocre. something i definitely wont order again. the second order was the griddle bread pudding...yikes. i wasn't expecting those flavors what so ever. it reminded me of uncooked french toast with the texture of french toast and flan put together. i actually enjoyed it so much more the day after when it was a little cold after heating it up a couple of seconds and taking a bite with syrupy goodness. still not a favorite though. i will give them another chance though so until then they only get 3 stars for now.</u_review>
<u_review>wow can you say heaven?   all you can eat amazing food?!  yes please!  i wanted to make sure i tried everything i could get my hands on and believe me i tried nearly everything minus a few things here and there. but it gives me an idea of what to expect next time and what not to get. my personal favorite as far as little appetizers would have to be the pork potstickers the endless cocktail shrimp,& half shell oysters.  for main course i love love loved the kobe beef. it was cooked just the way i like it medium rare-ish. the flavor was good but would be even more stellar with some a1. the prime rib lacked flavor but was definitely tender and right in color.  i tried the wild boar bacon and it was eating like a piece of salty ham. i'm a little weird when it comes to bacon because i would rather cook things with it and put it in things than eating it alone as a strip. if you love bacon for the flavor i recommend this unless you need the crispiness like i do somewhat.   other things i tried and didn't love as much were the asian drums in heaven or whatever it was called, the crab wonton wrapped things, the shrimp and mushroom risottto almost tasted like it wasn't finished cooking  & the red chili beef and the shrimp ceviche. as you can tell some things were just hit or miss. but the things i loved i loved with all my heart. so i have a better idea on my plate choices next time.  let's move on to dessert shall we?  creme brulee was good the texture of the custard reminded me of jello but it was still superb regardless of the jelloy effect :/ the little chocolate crepes were one of my all time favorites,  and a certain cookie to the left on the top shelf that was like eating a crisp sweet wafer were oh so good or like toffee without the effect where it sticks to your teeth! i didn't dip into all the cakes and pies because no restaurant can beat my pies and cheesecakes and cakes. so i passed them up without a doubt along with the little tarts. i hated the little strawberry shortcake parfait cup. *shivers* gelato here we go.... prickly pear-different but tasty. lemon ciello-good but way too much texture for me. i like smooth gelato.  blood orange-favorite!!!!!! i went on a sunday before the closed and i know for next time i will go for lunch they way i don't have to pay 27.95. i like the sound of 13.95-20.95 better. :)</u_review>
<u_review>i know i should probably eat here a couple more times before i review but whatever i will review anyways and you cannot stop me!  i had a sandwich that used texas toast, ham, pulled pork and bacon! yummmm!!!! now our waitress was very nice but screwed up with my fries. i asked for sweet potato but was debating on just getting the seasoned which she brought out since i got a sandwich that would be bbq'y goodness. so extra sweetness is just not something i love doing on a regular basis because i just feel overwhelmed. i cannot wait to go back so i can try the huge selection of beers. but i did try one which was their for a limited time. was not bad...apparently the wings were good. so until then i hope this helps :)</u_review>
<b_review>i decided to go out on a limb and give scramble another chance. after my bland experience with them the first time, but my akin likeness for modernized breakfast joints drew me back.   i brought a book and some paper to read and take notes for homework and arrived backpack in hand, and hungry for a hearty breakfast. southwestern breakfast burrito sounds delicious, chorizo, eggs, and jalepeno cream cheese?! i'll take it.  disappointed with the meaty-cheesy hashbrowns from last time, i went with the rosemary potatoes as suggested to me by the owner regarding my last yelp review. counter girl informs me sorry, we're out of rosemary potatoes. shock, gasp, awe. went for their signature hashbrowns again, reluctantly. regular coffee. $14.50. my jaw nearly hit the floor. scramble could stand to reduce their prices a little.   my order arrived about ten minutes later, almost too hot to dig in at first. i sat at the window on a stool, which was quite comfortable, and enjoyed the rainy morning. dug into the hashbrowns first, drizzled with some cholula. they were a lot better than last time, and i enjoyed every last bite of them. as for the burrito, i tried it at first without the jalepeno cream cheese, salsa, or sour cream, because they all came on the side. what was, for one bite, a seemingly bland breakfast burrito, became a spicy breakfast sensation with all of the aforementioned sides spread across it.   it began to get loud in there, and people everywhere i go seem to have this habit of sitting next to me with their talkative and annoying children when they can see i'm clearly engaged in an intellectually stimulating activity that stands to be disrupted abruptly by your obnoxious toddler. the place is huge, and there are plenty of open seats and cartoons tuned on their abundant flat screen tvs. i left after about 10 minutes of attempting to tolerate messy loud children, and enjoyed a smoke out on their large patio.  overall, a better dining experience, but a little expensive for my college student budget. the wait staff was friendly, and the place is filled with cute girls to make you blush. i would love to see more combination plates, like how with the omelette comes with a choice of two sides. it would be awesome to get pancakes, bacon, and eggs altogether for a set [lower] price than ordering everything a-la-carte. at least, that's how i prefer my breakfast: hearty.</b_review>
<b_review>this place gets two stars from me, and one of them is for its design.  it's the kind of place that i really, really, wanted to like and didn't.  it's inviting from outside and the inside does "spartan-chic"  very well.    the eating, experince, however, was nothing short of disappointing.  my dining companion commented that it felt like a cafeteria.  there was no service to speak of, and i had to fetch my drink out of a refrigerator.  you'd think that would keep the price down, wouldn't you?  well, it didn't.  i ordered the pigs-in-a-blanket, and the blanket was awful.  i ended up eating the pigs, which were uncanny in appearance and taste to the sausage links that my high-school band sold as a fund-raiser.   a downer of a place in more ways than one, not the least of which is that its decor is writing checks that its food isn't cashing.</b_review>
<b_review>on a never-ending quest for a delicious hangover cure breakfast, scramble seemed like a legit place to check out. unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing special here. even by the looks of the pictures people posted - i've seen and eaten better breakfast food. hell i've made better breakfast food.   yes, the place is super cool inside. plasma tv's are everywhere and i made the mistake of sitting on the side where all the tv's were playing childrens shows. yet i saw no children in the entire place. anyways, i'm not so sure about the pay first and seat yourself restaurant concept, as i feel like i paid the same for the food minus the service. and i don't like having to get up twice in a meal to get more syrup, or tabasco, or a refill.   the food, like i said, was average. like, really average. we went with the meat omelet with an english muffin and hashrbowns, and the peanut butter chip pancakes with a side of bacon. a coffee and an iced tea. the iced tea was horrible and the fountain machine was out of ice. we axed that and picked up another coffee, bold. good coffee. the bacon was chewy and had no flavor to it, and it was two measly pieces for $3. the pancakes were dry and overcooked. the hashbrowns were approached in a strange way by the scramble chefs- they had bacon in them. they came out in a circular lump. the omelet lacked any flavor and the eggs were of a spongy, hard texture. it was all unappetizing, and it looked as bad as it tasted.  really unimpressed. this space has potential to be cool. maybe i came on an off day where the chefs were hungover too. two stars for the coffee and atmosphere.</b_review>
<b_review>omg. what trippy breakfast experience. someone has teleported walt disney's automated breakfast restaurant of the future right out of epcot center and on to north 7th street in phoenix.  hop on the ride at the door where you pass the menu on the wall. read fast because this ride doesn't stop. don't lose your place in line! it's all about queuing here at disney.  give your order to the orange, expressionless, automaton robot-babe. receive a number. find a table and wait for disney magic to happen as dozens of orange robot-babes rush about delivering platters, busing plates and hauling coffee urns.  tables full? don't worry. crowd management is covered here at disney/scramble. when tables are full, one or two order taking orange robot-babes shut down to reduce the flow into the restaurant. at disney, everyone gets to the front of the line...and to their share of the breakfast magic...sooner or later.  the food? utterly soulless, just like the robot-babes.  rosemary potatoes? yup. there's potato. there's rosemary. can't argue with that.   scramble browns? perfectly formed circle. browned dark on one side; light on the other. don't like it too dark? turn it over!  multigrain pancakes? multigrained? yup. pancake? yup. perfectly round? yup. consistently sized? yup. too much cinnamon to cover the bland basic mix? yup. lots of syrup? yup!!! robot-babe, bring more syrup! i say these pancakes are just as good as any frozen eggo product you're going to find!  poached egg? it was poached. nice yellow yolk, just like the safe eggs from safeway. served in a nice little cup to keep them from running all over your plate.  scramble latte? super sugary!  coffee? yes. bold option? bold! regular option? regular!  alert! alert! alert! someone call hyatt place. the orange robot-babes have stolen all their square white plates. they are the perfect dishes for the automated restaurant of the future: unbreakable, stackable, space-saving, and easy to load and remove from an automated dish washing system!  got a group? no problem! all the tables are sized for two and are portable so they can be moved all around the restaurant to provide seating for a couple, a family or even a whole book club! be careful though. i would advise against creating any unique arrangements, say such as lining up tables on a 45-degree angle. i suspect the robot-babes could not compute. the entire restaurant could spin out of control and crash. experiment with caution.  folks, this food is every bit as good as the "free breakfast" you can get at la quinta, holiday inn express and hyatt place and better automated. plus you get orange robot-babes! if you like your hotel breakfast, you're gonna love this place.</b_review>

<text>home of the nicest women's bathroom (thus best seat in the house) in existence!  seriously.  check it out. ladies. go to the bathroom here. you will find wallpaper, a chaise posh lounge, large quality framed reproductions, marble sinks, a place i have actually sat down to business, as well as to regroup. you may think i am nuts for this, but it is totally true. especially when riding my bike from tempe to mesa, coming in to wash my hands and drink some water from the fountain to refresh. *hobos stay out*  other than that... i totally heart bookmans. i really respect the manager here (it was her idea for the b-room, gurls!) for the great staff, and well organized selection. is it a bit disarrayed and full of bizarre (sometimes hideous circa 1997 stationary?) knick-knackery? yeah. but go to any bookstore and there is always disarray-always piles, things misshelved. you try to shelve some books and fend off customers at the same time in a place as buzzed as this!   i mostly go for random browsing (graphic novels, art, pop culture, cookbooks, business, children's books, sociology) for works that may be discontinued, but i really come here for magazines. i love they sell magazines! magazines are my guilty pleasure b/c they are so expensive! sure, i can rent some mags from the library, but will they have the punk planet issue w/found magazine in it? hellll no! for most, ranges from 1.50-4.00. i get back issues of domino, dwell, fast company, believer, wired, readymade...and my real guilty pleasure, real simple. you cant really beat it for quality airplane reading, plus at those prices you can leave it for someone else to enjoy.  also, bookmans is really part of the community-they sponsor a lot of events, like rollerderby, the loft events in tucson, midnite movie mamacita, and more...  their booktrading is pretty fair, but if you have some items that are worth more than half of their cover price and they aren't rare, you may be better on-line. be sure to take your books back to donate them (and tax refund) b/c rarely do they take all of them-and don't hassle or argue w/the booktrader-just not classy.  oh, and i like the hot new used books to check out in the front!  if only a good coffee shop could open up inside...</text>
<u_review>this is a local arizona institution, so i am scared to give it 3 stars...but dammit, this site is about honesty, right?   my brother has tried to take me to an oregano's for a while, but there is always an insane wait at whatever one we have attempted. since it was an early weekday afternoon, i suggested this new one in mesa since there was bound not to be a wait-and we were right!  we entered and this place is pretty spacious. they asked if we wanted to eat at the bar-but to tell the truth it looked like on of the most unappealing bars i had ever seen. it reminded me of the barbie's mcdonald play set i had as a kid. plastic-y and just kind of kitchy-and not in the good way. no thanks. we were led through the restaurant and i have to admit it reminded me of a pizza hut. hmm... we opted for outside but kind of regreted it since it was hot out and the misters didn't do much.  the table was kind of large and i felt like my bro and i were at a conference table waiting for a terribly important meeting. the host was friendly and wanted our drink order kind of fast-but since it was my first time, i told him that. he then proceeded to tell me all the drinks. i mean all of them. i wished i had kept my mouth shut and just found the last page of the menu that listed drinks, since he proceeded to list them off verbatim. while he sat at our table. kind of awkward. am i being too east coast about this? after all that, got a fat tire and then proceeded to look over the menu. as a vegetarian and lactose intolerant, going to italian restaurants is kind of dumb for me, i admit. i mean i can eat pizza, but it just doesn't bode well.   i settled for the pasta basta, penne with feta cheese, pine nuts, olives, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and with a slice of garlic bread. it was a little spicy, but pretty tasty and not a bad deal for 8 bucks. i had some left over and the garlic bread toasted well the day after.  i just wasn't super impressed. it was a good solid restaurant, one you could bring grandman, your ma, a study group, kids, whatever, which is nice, right? but i found the service to be way too familiar and way too friendly (which sounds crazy, and trust me, i didnt think that was possible until i went here). i understood finally why children are scared of clowns after coming here. someone being overly nice and cheerful is just kind of eerie.</u_review>
<u_review>you have $20, it is a beautiful day in phoenix, it is 11:30 and you want brunch?   coronado cafe? yes.  a lazy saturday morning where palatte, over easy and matt's big breakfast had been vetoed led us to this charming renovated house. i immediately loved the set up of the out door patio and front porch. the front counter was really quaint-little glass domes for scones and a tiny little glass done that housed one single pastry (!) in a dark wood. we were led over to a four seater in the next room but with all of the sunshine coming in, there was no "bad" corner in the place.   brunch was conveniently placed on one page of the menu and was surprised to see tofu scramble listed as an option but decided to risk some dairy for the poached eggs with avocado and blue crab on foccaccia and roasted potatoes and split it with jared who got the scramble. the other two diners got the traditional eggs benedict and liked it.  both of our shared dishes combined were delicious-mine was really savoury and filling and the tofu scramble with filled with great veggies.   some hiccups were the eggs dishes potatoes were dried up, but the tofu one had great plump potatoes? makes me think they did those dishes first and keep them warm for a while.  i asked for hot sauce twice and they served it in one little dish to me, even though everyone had nodded when i asked for it. she offered whole wheat toast to the eggers, and then i found out it was an extra buck for the toast with jam-hmph. even though the french pressed coffee looked great, i wanted tea and no liquer-and they didn't have a very good selection. in fact our waitress seemed almost confused by my request-she unearthed some peppermint tea, but it was pretty commercial. it was served in a great single server mug/teapot combo though!  overall, i was totally full but not in a grossed out way and i paid around 16, 17 bucks for my share (including tip and tax and for sharing some of the drink cost). it was a great menu and i really enjoyed the ambiance and the service, despite the hiccups and i really want to try the seattle dutch baby pancakes with fruit-yummers!  ***update 1/31/09****  had the seattle dutch baby and it was even better than it looks-simply amazing, doesn't need maple syrup, incredible texture, not overtly sweet, and worth sharing. also had a pomosa, the pomegranate of the mimosa variety that was dry and refeshing. coffee was a huge french press, which i was surprised by since i was the only one having coffee and i thought they had little french coffee presses? and at 7 bucks, that was a steep two cups of coffee! make sure to specify how many people are having the coffee is my advise, no biggie. friendly, fast, relaxed service.</u_review>
<u_review>through stevey, i first heard of this place as a great little loungey place for food and wine and was surprised i had never heard of it.   about two weeks ago, i decided to finally drop off the rest of my over-due (by like four months...maybe more) books, which embarrassingly enough contained outkasts idlewood dvd that i probably owe 135 dollars in fine for keeping. the shame. i had already spent a relaxing day in phoenix, had a light lunch, and when walking back to the car, realized cheuvront was right there. i decided to brave crossing the "street" (since the light rail construction was going on right there) and check it out. it was like 3 something and i indulged in a glass of wine outside on the patio. the beeping of a construction vehicle didnt even deter from my experience, and i think the construction may be exactly what is hurting this business considering what should be its prime location.  stevey wanted to meet up with a brooklyn-ite here, so i made it here (even passing it to be honest) after checking the menu on-line to see if i could eat anything. i am lactose-intolerant, so going to a cheese place is kinda asking for the house of pain, and is about as smart as me being a meat free person going to a steak house. yeah. but they had some good salad options so i went for it.   i went for the salad nicoise, after convincing my other table mates to indulge in an appetizer (it seemed dumb to not sample at least some of the cheese this place has to offer) and it was fantastic. i def. want to try the spanish plate with almonds, and fig cake and all that good stuff next time. my salad was yummy-there was so much tuna i had to give it away, but no one complained despite their huge steaks and bacon wrapped shrimp to eat. overall, it was fantastic with the super light cab by the glass i chose, but i must confess i found the salad a tiny bit bland-a little more seasoning and better quality potatoes would have pushed this salad to a new place.  the place was inhabited by some big groups of ladies gettin their pre-game on, and it was pretty empty with just us there. i really think it isnt busy due to the horrible predictament with the light rail construction in front. next time you are near the heard, art museum or library, stop by here for a cheese plate or salad and some great wine, esp. near lunch hours.  one note: the bathrooms, while innovative, were so confusing-who on a date wants to look like an asshole who cant open a door to the bathroom? shits hard enough!</u_review>
<u_review>i have had made art boutique on my to check out list for way too long. when doing a day of phoenix to celebrate locally owned business for our holiday shopping, mr. mustachio and here were excited to check out this business.  housed in a beautiful older building, i was surprised by how little this store was-i kept peeking my head around corners thinking i had missed another room somehow.  cool books, super condensed selection of magazines to spread out casually on your vintage coffee table when watching the latests criterion release on your apple, and some nice ceramic ware left me thinking....okay.   what else?  i just didn't find anything for anyone on my list (or for myself-i am a selfish holiday shopper). we must have looked around this shop four times, hoping something new would catch our eye, some art piece would scream a name, some t-shirt would deserve our 20 bucks. nothing was over-priced, but i just didn't feel i was browsing from the creme of the crop and the jewelry didn't jump at me.  i would still recommend it for gifts for a variety of ages and to support local artists, but i didn't find anything and i was looking really hard to support this store.  meh art boutique.</u_review>
<b_review>i am a big fan of bookman's.  this is the go-to place for used books, music, magazines, and even video games.  my mom used to bring me here all the time when i was a kid reading all the goosebumps books because they always had at least one book out of the series that i was dying to get my hands on.  then i graduated to the animorphs series... i totally miss that.  again, they always had what i was looking for, and always at under 4 bucks!  unbeatable.  i don't come here as often anymore because i have one of those fancy ereaders and my husband downloads books for me, but i will probably stop by sometime to check out their cookbook selection.  i've always found the staff to be pretty helpful too.  the best part is, when you go to trade in your books they always give you a fair and honest deal, allowing you to trade for cash or in-store credit.  hooray for used book stores!</b_review>
<b_review>before i board a plane, my go-to place to pickup the latest magazines for cheap to leave on the flight for the next bored customer.</b_review>
<b_review>this place has everything. their gaming section is great. staff is nice.   i took 6 boxes of books, dvds, records and vhs today and they took a lot of it. i was excited when they said $250 in store credit...but less excited when they said $80 in cash. really? $250 to $80? not even $100? and i'm moving to another country so i can't take store credit.   anyway, other than that, it's great, especially if you want store credit.</b_review>
<b_review>bookman's offers your one stop shop for all used entertainment needs.  cds, blu rays, dvds, even old school vhs and records.  they have a vast selection of books, and also offer board games, magazines, video games, and role playing game manuals.  there is always a selection of vintage toys and various knick knacks to choose from if you are in a browsing mood.    selling your items can be a bit hit and miss.  something you would think would easily sell can sometimes be placed in the "no" pile, but that is the nature of selling your unwanted stuff.</b_review>

<text>tried this place for the first time today after reading the yelp reviews on burgers and i think it was even better than i had expected. the california burger was awesome and i loved the fries. to top it all off i had a dublin dr. pepper to was it down.  was the best burger shop hamburger i have had in years.   the have a soda shop also where you can pick out gourmet sodas with a really big selection.   service was fast and very friendly. i will definitely be back again when i am in the area.</text>
<u_review>came here expecting to eat at palee's crown and found it had changed to thai basil. first impression was good, it looks clean and nice inside and the staff was very welcoming, i had some curry but ordered it medium hot as when this place was palee's crown medium was like very hot most other places. the waitress was very charming and when i told her what  wanted and she said she would make it medium and bring me some chili sauce if i wanted it spicier. the food came and was on the mild side but delicious and after i added some chili sauce was perfectly to my liking, the fresh rolls were very good also, like a salad wrapped up in rice noodle with a very delicious sauce,   the service was excellent and the food very good, overall a great night.</u_review>
<u_review>went to golden buddha today for dim sum and it was awesome! i had not been in quite a while and i was very impressed with the quality of the food. i had some calamari from the cart and it was so crispy and delish, better than ever! i also tried the the special of the day, alligator in black bean sauce, was awesome! mixed in some shrimp dumplings, egg rolls, chinese broccoli, and hidden rice. service was great also, my date was very impressed and we will be coming back here again often!</u_review>
<u_review>we went to the farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day. i had the tuscan sandwich and it was awesome. i had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was. i'm sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience. this is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day. my date was equally impressed so i'm sure i will be back!</u_review>
<u_review>went here for thanksgiving and had a good time. they had all the normal thanksgiving turkey with dressing, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes and gravy, plus all the dinner buffet. i had some turkey then filled up with sushi and the bbq section. i like the selection here, it's not serious sit down quality but i think it is the best asian buffet around the valley. i had clams, crab, seared tuna, bbq pork and beef, seaweed salad, marinated baby squid, fresh oysters, and a few others.</u_review>
<b_review>i've actually visited rocket burger for several times already. one word that i can describe their service is it is consistently good. i've tried other burger joints but they simply don't get it that when i say "well done", i mean "well done".   anyway, my fave is their bacon cheeseburger and their philly burger (hey, i'm a burger guy!). meat is fresh and is cooked very well. the cheese properly melted making every bite a sumptuous rush. will be back for more my friends!</b_review>
<b_review>how can i be craving a rocket burger reuben and i have only had 3 in my life? that is how delish this place is! went there for carryout today. the owners are super nice, as usual. when i got home, mu food was piping hot and yummy! i hope everyone in the northern phx area begins frequenting this semi hidden gem. the food is excellent and affordable and the service is the best!</b_review>
<b_review>stopped in for a late lunch on a work day.  friendly place, they weren't busy so the service was pretty quick.  had a burger combo, really enjoyed the fries.  should have had a double on the burger though.  if i'm in the area i'll eat there but i don't think it's going to be one of my "usuals".</b_review>
<b_review>best pulled pork i have found in phoenix!! and love the drink selection found a huckleberry cream soda i drove 1200 miles to get last time!! new favorite! can't wait to go back for another sandwich and after reading other reviews onion rings i think. ugh but which of the bagillion sodas to choose from??!? and def trying the ice cream..... tomorrow for real.</b_review>

<text>i haven't reviewed the windsor yet? shame on me!  before you enter, be very careful where you park. pay attention to the signs in the residential streets, you will get ticketed. i almost always valet as i am impatient and lazy.  the architecture is similar to postinos, it has that old- wood-modern-minimal-rustic-charm feeling. the patio outside rocks, if weather allows sit outside.   the food is wonderful. my favorite is the bahn mi fish sandwich, second favorite is the ribs, and of course the 5000 calorie porkwich is also delectable. the vegetable chop and mixed grain salads are wonderful and so is the burger (order it windsor style, trust me)..   the bartenders are friendly, the drinks are stiff and the wine list is hefty. this has become one of my cen pho favorite spots.</text>
<u_review>went here with tori on sunday and we had a really good time. the restauraunt surrounds a duck pond and we are both big duck fans so we sat outside and the ambiance was great. this is the perfect spot for wedding or work parties. the patios are huge. the food was ok, we just split the chile verde and it was spicy and the pork was really tender. we also had sangria and although a bit sweet for my tastes it was still pretty good.</u_review>
<u_review>much to my delight i visited again on a monday and was told it was  1/2 off all bottles of wine. whoohoo! i sat at the bar and started with the ducketts bucket, it was a generous serving of clams and oysters in a light wine, lemon butter broth. i had the mahi mahi special for my main served with a side of leeks. it was all pretty delicious.   the food seems to get better every time i come here. i need to remember what a great happy hour they have.</u_review>
<u_review>i used solis for both a mammogram and an ultrasound. the wait to be seen was not bad and they had great magazines in the waiting room. once i was see the doctor was quite helpful. she really took the time to explain everything with me, including my options for treatment.  hopefully i will not have to get another mammogram, but if i do,  this is where i would go.</u_review>
<u_review>i love fez. they consistently prepare great dishes; i have been there about 20 times and never once had a bad meal. the wait staff is very friendly and they do a great job of remembering what you ordered last time you came in.  a few of my favorites, the super garlicky hummus with crisp pitas, the all american fez burger, the spicy harrissa fries mmmm yum.  last time i got to enjoy these with my dog on the patio, yes they are dog friendly which rocks. they also do a delicious brunch. the fez frittata is great, as is their french toast, try going on a sunday and it is half price bottles of champagne! mimosa anyone?</u_review>
<b_review>perfect spot to meet a friend or two for after work hh/dinner. parking sucks (hence the seemingly odd valet)...or you can just park street-side in the neighborhood while you dine on some elevated american food.   i had the cheddar fondue and porkwich, both of which were reasonably priced and succulent! i'm not a huge eater at one sitting, so there was definitely a large enough portion to take home for a midnight snack.   just the right amount of menu items means i'm enticed to return and try their other entrees. the country vegetable chopped salad sounds pretty dang tasty!</b_review>
<b_review>my go to central phoenix hangout, windsor has not disappointed. i love the decor, the crowd, the super friendly and professional staff and the #17! a cucumber, green tea and mint cocktail. i get one almost every time i visit...and i always try to visit during their half priced happy hours that go until 5pm, even on saturdays. for a week night, it is kind of an odd ending time for a happy hour...no post work specials if you're working a 9-5.   i've only eaten here a couple times, and the last time i had the mac and cheese side dish. i'm a sucker for mac and cheese when i see it on any moderate to upscale menu. it was heavenly! creamy, topped with bread crumbs and finished in the oven for a nice 'crust'.   i will continue to be a patron and every time i introduce friends to what central phoenix has to offer, windsor is at the top of the list.</b_review>
<b_review>first trip to windsor after driving by countless times and it did not disappoint. i had the brown bag chicken sandwich with a side of mac'n cheese and it was absolutely delicious. the service was fantastic which is a big factor for me in my star rating. we were only there for a bite but it's definitely the kind of place i could hang out for a few drinks. it looks like they have some pretty reasonable drink specials before 5:30 on weekdays. also attached is a candy/ice-cream shop so guys, if you're looking for a great date spot, windsor will impress...guaranteed.</b_review>
<b_review>one of the best happy hours in town - $5 for pitchers of beer, glasses of wine or cocktails before 5pm every day - amazing!  the atmosphere is great in this place - very comfortable and relaxing.  the service is slow, but pretty good and the cocktail menu is great!</b_review>

<text>i finally had the opportunity to try this place.  the atmosphere is fabulous...love the decor which feels sort of chic, elegant yet understated with a great mix of colors and textures...i'm very aesthetic and a beautifully decorated restuarant ususally enhances my reviews :)  we were seated in the far back room which was nice, comfortable, well lit and very quiet.  i was immediately impressed with the lunch menu which felt very comprehensive and certainly not overpriced whatsoever.  i opted for the curry chicken salad ($11) which includes field greens, chicken breast, sliced almonds and golden raisens with a two dressing combination of creamy curry and a red wine vinagarette which i ordered on the side.  i ate every last bite of the salad.  she ordered the heirloom beet salad ($11) which was a very nice presentation.  the focaccia bread with pesto dipping sauce edged my carb craving.  oh, i can't forget the fabulous black iced tea (with a hint of tropical flavor) which was just delicious.    the service was extremely friendly and attentive...absolutely no complaints whatsoever.  it was an extremely nice dining experience and i'm looking forward to returning soon.</text>
<u_review>omg...best buffet in the valley hands down!!!  beats any lv buffet including bellagio etc.  go for lunch...$13.95 is a bargain for this culinary destination.  i've been here twice and have been beyond impressed with the overall freshness, selection and presentation.  some highlights:  - salad bar - the "bomb" based on overall taste, selection and freshness as mentioned above...artichoke hearts, marinated olives, gourmet cheeses, many delicious prepared salads etc.  - chinese - fresh, hot and delicious!   scallop lomein, duck spring rolls, potstickers, and several other hot delicious looking entrees  - brick oven pizza - spinach, mushroom & artichokes....need i say more?  - stuffed eggplant - didn't even have room for this italian masterpiece...bummer!  - desserts - same as above....every imaginable flavor of gelato and so much more!  i cannot wait to go back here!!!!</u_review>
<u_review>i just had a to review another f&e because i freakin' love this store!  if i never go to fry's or bashas again, it will be too soon!  this is the ultimate grocery shopping experience...it's never crowded, they have a fabulous selection and variety, the prices rock, there are friendly, mature and helpful cashiers, and if you're hungry, there are free samples!  for those of us who are having to really watch our food budget, this place is the bomb!  you just can't beat the marked down section...it's like a treasure hunt!  try wild alaskan salmon burgers (2) for $.90, wth?  some of my new fav items include:  - green chile sliced sourdough bread (sometimes marked down to $1.03 a loaf) - indian appetizer platter with onion bihaly's (sp), vegetable samosas and cool cilantro yogurt dip ($5.99) - big kahuna chardonnay and shiraz ($2.99) - veggie chips ($2.19) - thin crust frozen pepperoni pizza ($2.99)  and i just love that there is practically a f&e on every corner in the far se valley.</u_review>
<u_review>i was up in n. scottsdale today which is quite a trek from the far se valley, however, i had to run an errand and always look forward to having an excuse to get out of gilbert.  i've dined at the san tan village location which is fairly new and i wasn't overly impressed, but i really enjoyed frequenting this location when i lived and worked in this area from 1999-2002.  anyway, someone else mentioned that the patio is now enclosed which i did not notice.  we were escorted to a booth in the back of the restaurant near the bar area.  i couldn't help but notice the five bmw's and three escalades lined up in the parking lot....toto, i guess we're not in kansas anymore!  not that the se valley is "the hood" but it's certainly a different demographic.  so, i digress....i do like the atmosphere at this arriba as it feels more festive and somewhat livelier than similar restaurants.  and, i love the picture menu and the chips/salsas/bean dip seriously rocks!  as i've stated in many of my previous reviews, i'm extremely price conscious (kindof nazi-ish) since my disposable income has been reduced by about 60% in the last year.  so, i immediately notice that the prices are really high for your "run of the mill" mexican fare.  since it's sunday, there are no lunch specials and almost everything (with the exception of appetizers) is at least $10 or more.  i opt for the chicken tostada (see pics) with rice and charro beans.  at $8.59 it's a fair price and was surprisingly really tasty and filling.  my dining companion is more in the mood for a snack, so he orders the mini beef chimis with jalepeno (i think) cream cheese and sour cream.  here is where i really  need to rant.  they charged an extra $1.99 for a tiny scoop of sour cream - wth?.  yes, i know that i sound like a cheap a**, however, the waiter asked if he wanted sour cream and completely made it sound like it was included in the price.  scam!!!  it came right off his tip, i'm sorry to say.    it's not like i'm going to miss $2, it's just the basic principle that some restaurants are trying to make an extra buck....it did not change the fact that i enjoyed my meal, but i will always remember arriba for being so freakin' cheap.   and now, i'm having a flashback to another dining experience at the san tan location where i was charged $16.99 for a "double" margarita.  anyway, i am looking forward to the day when price won't be such an issue, but for the time being i will continue to really dislike getting ripped off!</u_review>
<u_review>as a die hard mexican foodie, i would have to rate the food as about a 3.5, but what's with the "up charge" for cheese and sour cream?  i've always been a big chipotle fan and am willing to pay nearly $10 for a burrito, chips/salsa and a large drink, but this place really irritated me.  i asked for lettuce in my burrito and received both a dirty look and about five small shreds...wth???  yes, the tortilla was pretty yummy and the meat fairly tasty, but i really hate being nickel and dimed for everything.  i'll stick with fili b's for the cheaper and more authentic version and baja fresh for the americanized tex-mex (or whatever) version with a free salsa bar.</u_review>
<b_review>i hosted a large work event on the patio with heavy appetizers and drinks for about 40 people. our main server, daniel, as an absolute rock star - he took care of our whole group swiftly with a smile. daniel has the ability to take drink and food orders for about 20 people at a time, all in his head, without missing a thing. i cannot say enough good about daniel - ask for him, he will take care of you.  otherwise, the food was really good - bacon wrapped dates, flatbreads, ravioli served family style, beet salad and hummus. they also have interesting cocktails, sangria and a great wine/beer selection.   we will be back for future events - thank you!</b_review>
<b_review>great location!  been here for dinner twice, brunch once.  dinner is very good.  the espresso poured over ice cream dessert is very unique, and a must try.  for brunch, the vanilla yogurt is amazing!  and i hate yogurt.  it is the only yogurt i will eat.  the potato flat bread is only meh.  long wait times.  crazy scottsdale clubbers fill the bar area on weekend nights too; its distracting when trying to have a nice dinner.</b_review>
<b_review>this was one of my favorite restaurants during my visit to arizona. don't skip the mouthwatering lamb meatballs and bacon wrapped dates (loved the fresh bread and sauce with the meatballs).  for entrees we shared the sea bass and sweet potato cannelloni. both were delicious but i preferred the cannelloni-- the pasta had both wonderful flavor and texture. we were stuffed but had to try the house made gelato and the peanut butter pudding. i loved the dark chocolate gelato and the coconut- the espresso was just ok and didn't have the best texture.  the peanut butter pudding was tasty but very rich and heavy.  be sure to make a reservation as it can get quite crowded on weekends. we came a hoping to be seated a bit early and there was no space at the bar. servers were quick and attentive. i was impressed by how quickly food came out even though it was so busy.</b_review>
<b_review>the bff and i decided to have a fancy date night and get dressed up to go to dinner and a movie.  we decided on olive & ivy because it was centrally located for us and had a nice ambience.  i made reservations for us because it made it feel more "date-like" and also i was going to be coming straight from work and knew i'd be starving.  i got there just about exactly when my reservation was made for and was told to have a seat and my table would be ready shortly.  now, the place wasn't packed by any means, sure there was a good number of people in the restaurant but there wasn't like a huge group of people waiting around to be seated.  for some reason though, despite the fact that i'd made a reservation, i waited for 15-20 minutes for my table.  so what's the point of making a reservation?  i could have walked in off the street and had the same thing.  once we got to our table the server came over right away and introduced himself and offered us drinks.  since my friend is pregnant she was asking about non-alcoholic options but they really didn't have many selections so she stuck with water as did i so as not to feel like i was teasing her by dangling a martini in her face.  we decided to get the 3 bruschetta for $11 deal as an appetizer to tide us over to our main course.  they were all delicious but pretty small, only 3 pieces per slice.  we both decided on the mediterranean salad, with hers she asked for it with no feta and a side of olives though.  they were good but not outstanding.  our server was friendly the whole time and did an awesome job making sure our water was full and we had whatever we needed.  i ended my meal with the passion fruit sorbet which was good at first but the flavor got to be a bit too much after a few bites.</b_review>

<text>sweeeeet!  don't you just love it when you have had a place bookmarked for so long that you almost forgot about it, and when you finally go it's amazing?  yeah, that's what happened here.  we had been doing a little shopping out in this part of town and were starting to get hungry so we started searching for places to go.  the husband mentioned this place and i was quite enthusiastic and mentioned i have had it bookmarked for so long.    we made our way over to the cute little store with it's big glass front and cool brick interior.  there's lots of cool music oriented art around and the tables are covered in graffiti.  again, it's a pretty sweet place, aside from the lack of air circulation.  we stared at the gigantic chalkboard menu for a while (despite being chalkboard it's pretty easy to read) and finally made our selections.  i got the stromboli and the husband went with the meatball calzone.  the guy making our stuff was really cool and helpful.  the best part was that he really seemed to love his job.  you gotta love that.  when our food came out, the smell was intoxicating.  i dug right in and relished in the delicious garlicky dough and the sweet yet tangy sauce.  the ham was perfect and sweet and the pepperoni were meaty and spicy.  i tell ya, this stromboli was glorious.  it was glorious and huge!  i had to take half of it home, and yes, the leftovers were just as good.  i have a feeling that anytime i find myself in this neighborhood i am going to start salivating for the delicious goods here.  you should go.  you should also tell all your friends to go.  a place like this is too good to keep secret.</text>
<u_review>eh, this place is alright.  we wanted to try something new this weekend and we happened to drive by so we gave texaz grill a shot.  i of course yelped it first to decide what i was going to eat, and the response was overwhelmingly to get the chicken fried steak.  okay then.    inside, this place is literally covered in crap.  there are business cards along the door frame and all over the ceiling.  baseball caps literally line the entire perimeter of the room and then some.  there really isn't an inch of space that hasn't been covered with some form of texas style memorabilia.    i got the chicken fried steak, obviously, and it came with mashed potatoes, corn, and a biscuit.  the potatoes were okay, nothin special, the corn was okay but a little peppery, the biscuit was very bland and the bottom was a bit hard, and the chicken fried steak was just ok.  i've had a few chicken fried steaks in my life, and this one did not stand out.  it was really crisp and crunchy on the outside, which i like, but flavor-wise, there was just something missing.  it was just okay.  service was quick and efficient.  we had our meal in under 30 minutes, so that was nice i guess.  i probably won't be back, but at least i tried.</u_review>
<u_review>this is one among the very few places i have gone to eat in scottsdale.  we stopped in at late lunchtime on a weekend, and it was quite busy, but there was space for us to sit on the patio.  the decor was cool and sleek, and the staff was all pretty upbeat and friendly.  the friendliness of the staff was definitely a surprise to me in uber-trendyville.    since it was our first time here, my husband and i ordered a few different things to share so we could try more stuff.  we ordered a buffalo and a lamb burger, tater tots, and the mac and jack.  one of the things i instantly loved about this place was the customization options.  you ordered the burger meat, and then any cheese or other toppings.  i made a delicious creation with lamb, swiss, bacon and mushrooms.  yeah baby.  as for the rest of the food, the tots were nice and crispy with the perfect amount of salt.  the mac and jack was also delicious.  the buffalo, i was a little less than pleased with, as i think they overcooked it.  buffalo is such a lean meat that just a second too long on the grill will dry it out.    the food was great, the service is good, the people watching is killer.  i really really liked this place, and i would certainly go back if i am in the area.</u_review>
<u_review>yum yum yum!  i love gelato.  i also love the cheeky little nickname of this place "the g spot."    as far as the layout and service of this place goes, they really only deserve a couple stars.  the layout makes it very unclear where you are supposed to order and when this place is crowded, it can be a nightmare.  the kids behind the counter are more often than not just as confused as the customers and they just kind of hover around and wait to be pounced on.    the gelato here is outstanding.  it's all very fresh, and you can taste that.  my favorite flavor here is either the cheesecake or the bacio.  good stuff.  their fruit flavors are all excellent too, very sweet and tart at the same time.  they make great palate cleansers too.  definitely a good place to try sometime, but make sure you are agressive and push your way to the front and ask for help if it's crowded.  don't be afraid to ask for samples either.</u_review>
<u_review>we don't typically go out to places like these, salad buffets, mostly because they gross the husband out.  that's fine with me, i understand.  at the request of friends one time, and for a family celebration another, we came here.  i've been to a couple st locations, and this one seems to be laid out better than others as well as cleaner.  their selection of food always looks fresh and they don't let it get too low, so that's nice.  i do love their corn bread with the honey whip ( you have to ask for it) and their side dish type pasta salads are usually pretty good.  this place isn't amazing, like my best friend thinks it is, but it is a pretty solid salad buffet.</u_review>
<b_review>good place.. the decor is nice old building and they accent its charm in the decor. food was delish kids had pizza wife and i had sand witches. not just another pizza joint is what i enjoyed about it.</b_review>
<b_review>this pizza is great, i just wish they were open more often. i have only had their pizza once, but have tried to have their pizza 4 times. they are closed at (my) dinner time, and i keep forgetting (silly me). if you can get it, their pizza is some good stuff. also, everyone who works there are super sweet! plus they have pinball which rocks my socks.</b_review>
<b_review>my family likes to visit queen's. it can be hit or miss with the service. they don't do well under pressure, but if you happen in when there isn't a rush, you will get great pizza and awesome service.</b_review>
<b_review>whoa this place is amazing.  i can't believe i found something edible in downtown mesa.  one poor guy behind the counter banging out pizza, calzone, stromboli, and all sorts of other goodies - i'm impressed.  the calzone i ordered (meatball) was one of the best things i have ever had.  the sauce is sweet, the dough is garlicy, and the fillings are plentiful.  this place is not only somewhere i would tell other people to hit up but somewhere that i would make a special trip to go visit.  fortunately for me, it's near ashley a's house.  she better not serve me pizza hut again after showing her this place.</b_review>

<text>it's just not worth it to go here. the service is a hit or miss - some waitresses are helpful; some are bimbos. the food isn't that great... you can definitely find better. the inside setup... well, we had to sit outside because of it. i wouldn't go back.</text>
<u_review>the view from our room. the compass. cleaning staff all day long. the jacuzzi and pools. stellar customer service. the gym. spacious, beautifully decorated rooms. the cafe and lounges. the area and all it has to offer.  not to mention, we nabbed it at a killer price via priceline.  the reason for four stars instead of five: valet parking = $27 a day, ouch. wifi = $10 a day, yikes.   nevertheless, i'm pretty sure many babies will be born from staying at this lovely hotel.</u_review>
<u_review>my co-worker took me here and i'll forever love her for it.   best. gumbo. ever.  and the garlic bread. and the shrimp cocktail. and the crawfish.   i think i know what i'll be eating for lunch tomorrow. you should too!</u_review>
<u_review>i never thought i'd be leaving a review for a grocery store, but last night's experience at the deli was so god-awful.   i had to pick up a few items for the house and suddenly craved fried chicken. rather than going to nasty kfc, i decided to pick some up from their deli.  the lady who takes your order is rude. she was talking to a co-worker while i was waiting to place my order, and didn't stop talking to said co-worker until i said, "excuse me - should i come back?"  then i ordered the 8 piece (for me and the family) with two sides. the sides aren't listed on the menu, so i asked her what the sides were. she proceeded to (without even looking at me) point to the right and said "there."  the sides were terrible. the mac n cheese was almost gone. no mashed potatoes. i was left with seafood salad and coleslaw. i take everything home and was so livid when i took the first bite of chicken. there was no chicken on the inside. how is that even possible? it was just burnt skin.   i would have been better off at kfc.</u_review>
<u_review>ehh, three stars because of delivery and fast service. if you have to work on the weekend (thanks boss) and you want a place to deliver, you're shit outta luck in downtown. soooo jimmy john's to the rescue (somewhat) and your food is delivered with pretty quick timing...   as far as the food goes - i felt like i was eating a sandwich from home. i ordered the tuna. it was decent, but the bread was terrible. it's french bread, which is hard to chew and without any kind of flavor. the tuna had cheese, cucumbers, and celery on top, so i added avocado for an extra kick... and i didn't get my kick.  not eating here again.</u_review>
<b_review>this was our first time here. the server was a complete ___! megan was her name. the overall feel of the place was pretty good. the food looked pretty good. service was horrible, so i didn't get far enough to get the full experience.</b_review>
<b_review>good place, dark, tons of tvs and great food, i like to sit in the restaurant area because it has more to view, and the bar area seems to be full of d-bags but that's just me. but since it is close to home it's always up there on places to go when you want a quick drink or some bar food.</b_review>
<b_review>had to make a trip out to phoenix to pick up a new piece of equipment for my shop....as long as i was in phoenix, i figured it'd be a good time to see my old friend rob who moved out their last year as well.  so i loaded up the machinery....called rob and asked where we should meet. he picked santisi brothers. it was convienent to both of us and rob said it was his new watering hole.   walking in, the first thing i noticed is that it's fairly dimly lit. i like that. it's bigger on the inside than it appears as well. (they also have a patio outside with a plasma tv and misters) this place has a ton of t.v.'s. there was every imaginable sport and/or event possible on all at once. i never looked up and couldn't find something interesting going on.   food wise i had the chicken breast meal with a salad. everything was tasty.....rob and his girl had pizza which looked very good. waitress was on top of it and customers were mostly happy and laughing.   nice place.</b_review>
<b_review>driving home from the far northwest valley, i spotted the sign for santisi brothers from the freeway and told my husband what awesome pizza and oysters they had.   i guess i should mention the last time i was at santisi brothers was about 9 years ago. back then, they did have great raw oysters--huge and succulent. i don't know when they stopped serving them but i was very disappointed tonight because that's what i really wanted.   i remembered the pizza as being right up there with some i've had back east. what we had tonight (the 10" cheese pizza--which by the way is the best test of how good a pizza is if it can stand alone with no toppings) was only a step above domino's to me. maybe the thin crust is better but i didn't feel like spending an extra $4.00 to find out.   the one bright spot was the philly cheese steak. they got the steak, cheese and peppers just right. the roll was a little doughy to me but i have high expectations for a cheese steak since i grew up outside of philly.   the service was good and if you are a sports fan, you can't ask for more games on more tvs. i could have done without the screaming oklahoma fans a couple of tables away though. but it's a sports bar so i don't hold them accountable for the fans there.   santisi brothers, if you read this, i am begging you to bring back the oysters. maybe then the drive from the east side would be worth it. otherwise i can find so-so bar food in my neck of the woods.</b_review>

<text>not the best sushi in the world but i appreciate the value of their lunch specials as well as the charm, panache and mystique of the bartenders.   tip - they also make a fantastic squid salad.</text>
<u_review>this costco is soooooo busy....  "how busy is it?"  this costco is so busy..... the other day i actually googled "the busiest costco in america" and guess what!? it's not the busiest one :(   the busiest costco is in seattle.  had you going there for a second didn't i?  that's why this costco gets 3 stars from me. i've been going here for years now and no matter when i go the whole place is like a buddhist 's nightmare. total anarchy.  and the managers are always huddled up at the end of the lines of shoppers acting like "what do we do now...there are lots of people here today"   and they stopped selling single turkey crosandwitches with a side cesar! all they have in the deli section now is 10 lb. meatloaf trays and some giant tubs of greasy penne that they try to market as "pasta salad". wtf!!! i guess i just have to go out and find myself a huge family to justify buying anything fresh.   on a positive note, the dog food, water and coffee are pretty good.</u_review>
<u_review>when i was a naïve young man i used to go out and party on weekends. it was as if every friday was the beginning of a national holiday requiring two days of intoxicated celebration. on any given night i would drop $10 to $30 on cover charges, $50 to $75 on drinks, $10 to $20 for the 2:00am munchies and another $20 -$30 on a cab ride home. and what was i left with? a headache, some fuzzy memories and taking inventory of decisions made the night before.     fortunately, with age comes wisdom. i have learned that a better way to celebrate life is to embrace unique opportunities and experiences.  if i am going to spend $100 tonight i am going to spend it wisely.  eating at toyama is a "value added" decision in my opinion.  i have gone twice now in as many weeks and both meals were fantastic.  my sister and brother-in-law joined me last friday.  they were here visiting from california. we decided to go for broke and order the "omakase" - chef's choice.  when it was all said and done they both agreed that a meal like this would have cost twice as much in la.  while i can't remember every detail, some of the highlights were as follows...  -        an amazing sashimi platter, with fresh tuna, yellowtail and uni.   -        two different toro dishes. one nigiri and one toro tartare dish. -        this incredible spanish mackerel  sushi topped with a thin strip of sweet kelp. -        a custom roll with thai hot sauce, tuna and avocado. amazing. -        salmon roe sushi soaked and rinsed the proper  way.  it went on and on. each new dish was a new indescribable flavor experience. one dish had this japanese shisho leaf on it. we were all at the table trying to come up with a comparable flavor to describe it...."it tastes like a licorice-earthy-minty-nutmegy-etc..."...sounding like wine snobs trying to come up with just the right description, only this was food.  really good food.   we got there early and were the only patrons for awhile so part of the amazing experience was the great conversation with our chef. we talked about golf, football, chef's knives, santa barbara, japanese whisky, our favorite restaurants, etc... it was so interactive.  a great meal, a great evening... a great memory. well worth the money.</u_review>
<u_review>1) the wait staff all wear silly costumes  2) our entrees came out before the appetizers which was totally bizarre.   3) the apps were dropped off at the table before we finished the entrees.   4) the food was ok but not worth what we paid.   5) they comp'd the second round of sangrias due to the kitchen mixup so that was nice.   6) great location, right on the waterfront.   7) cheesy decor.  felt like a chain.</u_review>
<u_review>great store. perfect for the scottsdalite that doesn't want to be bothered with actually having to interact with other human beings at a cash register. everything is automated. i would have given this place five stars but the automated checkout system is not manufactured by apple so its totally ghetto. also, plenty of healthy choices are available for those of us who haven't had a carb in over 2 years. i am addicted to their store brand brie.   in all seriousness, try their broccoli cheese soup. fantastic. and there is a great pet store in this shopping center to check out if your in the neighborhood and want to buy your little pal a new toy.</u_review>
<b_review>i adore ra!  they have a great selection of sushi.  go for happy hour.  its only a couple of hours, but you really get some great items for pretty cheap.  you can even get a large asahi for about $5!</b_review>
<b_review>i enjoy this place at happy hour as they have some really go prices. all of their appetizers are half off as well as a few of their drinks. i do wish they had more rolls on the happy hour menu but hey you take what you can get. you can eat pretty good for less than $10 during happy hour and that includes a beer. not too shabby if you are on a budget like me! :)</b_review>
<b_review>i have eaten hear over the years. most of the time on happy hour. the menu for happy hour always changes and seems to be decent. good flavors, ok size. the reason why it only gets 2 stars in my book. turn the fucking music down! the tech music they play sucks! it is hard to hold a conversation with that shit turned up to "11" if you can handle that then enjoy.</b_review>
<b_review>ra boasts a fine happy hour.  the seaweed salad is fabulous and the rolls are sufficient.  like the rest of the area, the scene at this location is full of cougars and trouts.  the patio area is nice and offers a view of kierland's shopping area.    stingray at scottsdale quarter is also open and sapporo is nearby as well.....</b_review>

<text>la condesa is an amazing little spot that has more than food, but charm as well. i really enjoyed the way that the restaurant was decorated; it definitely creates its own vibe, and it's not painted with a lot of loud colors (there are a ton of pictures of the decor if you look at the pictures). it's very classy to say the least.  the salsa bar is the first thing that i have to mention. it was overflowing with variety and flavor. every time that i thought i'd found one that i liked, i tried another and pushed the previous aside. my girlfriend and i managed to polish of two baskets of chips without a problem or remorse because we had to try every salsa. the tamatillo and cilantro were two of my favorites in the mix.   we also ordered the mayan conchinita pibil tacos and the aztec tinga tacos. i'm usually hesitant about chicken on tacos because i usually always have bad experiences, but not here! the tinga taco was great. the meat was tender and well marinated - i could taste the sauce in every bite. the conchinita though is what really won me over. the pork was so good! imagine the tenderness and juiciness or your favorite bbq pork sandwich, but replace the flavor with a bevy of delicious mexican spices and we'll pretty much be on the same level.  i'm pretty baffled that i didn't see a lot of my yelp friends raving about this place. as a result, i will send this review out to you all (go try it =) ). this is a great little place that isn't pricey yet brings great flavor. the next time i got there i will be getting a quesa, no question, and hopefully i will be going back very soon.</text>
<u_review>teakwoods is a divey-esque bar where you're allowed to make a mess and throw peanut shells on the ground. it's filled with a ridiculous mix of patrons and bar food that seriously steps it up a notch; they even won a best of phoenix award for their wings. don't let that limit the menu for you though... i've tried a bunch of their food and here's what i think:  hot wings - great sauces and the wings themselves are cooked perfectly how i like em (crispy outside and chewy in the middle).  buffalo chicken sammich - like a giant hot wing on a bun! i like the el heffe sauce, but hold the mayo!  jack not jill chicken sammich - chicken, avocado, jack cheese and bacon. delicious.  lavosh - basically passover pizza! it's a creative way to make put pizza on the menu without the pizza oven.  mac & cheese - another great entree! i respect a place that does two things to their m&c... 1: they use real cheese and melt it. 2: it's not cut from a friggin' casserole. teakwoods covers those bases very well.  candlestick carver - my first sammich at teakwoods, and a memorable one. sliced beef, grilled green chiles and tomatoes, horseradish mayo and provolone on sourdough, with au jus. it's huge.  that all being said, the service has been pretty good each time i've gone, and the whole staff is loaded with different recommendations that have all proven to be good. lastly, their drink specials are absolutely great (fri and sun - pints of four peaks are cheaper here than at the brewery during hh).   i like teakwoods a lot. it has become one of my new watering holes, so don't be shy if you check in and happen to see me getting my grub on down the way.</u_review>
<u_review>i was really surprised by this place. it honestly doesn't look like much from the outside but once you go in, you can see that the owners put some time into their restaurant; it is very well decorated. this place has the potential for a great date spot and a great spot to go with a few friends. from what i saw, their happy hour would be enough to wrangle me back in.  as far as food, i should just say that, again, i was really surprised. i had the spicy curry beef linguine and it was fantastic. i went in there really hungry and the portions were just right. the waiter (andy) took great care of my table and got us everything we needed very quickly.  cherryblossom noodle has great food, great service and very reasonable prices (yet another surprise). i will definitely be going back to try more of their food and hopefully hit up a happy hour in the near future.</u_review>
<u_review>where the hell are the amazing indian restaurants in phoenix? in north scottsdale and chandler there is indian paradise, tempe has kohi noor and dhaba and now mesa has india oven! no love for central phoenix...  but i digress. india oven is one hell of an indian restaurant. their buffet is very very diversified and i had to have a sample of nearly everything because it all looked too amazing to pass up! i mean, they had lamb curry in the buffet....lamb curry! to me, that's a hook, line and sinker. but, just when i thought i found what i was going to get seconds of, i came across the chicken marsala. to quote a famous mouse, "oh, me! oh, my!" it was really incredible! it's definitely something that needs opinions by all you yelpers salivating while reading this. one last thing about the buffet is that it changes and expands depending on what's fresh and what time of day you drop by. i've even heard that they serve lamb vindaloo on occasion (again, this is in the buffet).  plain and simple, if i lived in mesa, close enough to india oven to be a frequent customer, i would be sporting plenty of extra happy pounds. but for now, i'll just use the distance as an excuse to gorge myself and not feel as guilty about it. please do me a favor if you're reading this and try this place already.</u_review>
<u_review>there are three things saba's does undoubtedly right. firstly, their gyros; they are great and some versions are very unique like their buffalo gyro! next up would be their fries. they are cooked perfectly and are firm and crispy on the outside yet warm and mushy on the inside (i love my fries like that). lastly, their lemon rice soup. let me stress that everyone, unless they're either repulsed by or deathly allergic to lemons, needs to try a cup of this soup! i remember when i used to come here and it was only served on thursdays and fridays. lately it has become so popular that saba's serves it every day (that should say something).   everything else that i've tried at saba's has been good but the three above mentioned items are great and my favorites. they are what keep me coming back and should really be considered for anyone visiting this restaurant.</u_review>
<b_review>this place is blowin' up on yelp and for good reason!  i have a strong desire to knock one star off every review i have for other mexican spots after eating here.  the salsa bar is fantastic, and with so many choices (upwards around 10!) it was really hard to stick with four or five little cups.  i decided to go kind of random with my taco selections and picked the baja sur dogfish shark taco and the cochinita pibil - marinated pork.  i seriously think the cochinita pibil was the best taco i've ever had, at least north of the border anyway.  the dogfish shark taco was very good as well.  i think my search for the best tacos in phoenix has come to a close!  it's going to be really tough to justify going to another place after this experience.</b_review>
<b_review>amazing food & the absolute best horchata that i've ever had! the atmosphere is great including the paintings inside and new calavera they put outside. the food is always fresh and there's a variety of different salsas to choose from at the salsa bar. great little place to have around the neighborhood, great addition. :)</b_review>
<b_review>la condesa is without a doubt one of the best mexican establishments in all of phoenix.  their salsa bar is one of our favorite parts, with so many unique flavors to choose from and each one is delicious.  we have had everything from their tacos, burritos and quesadillas and all have been a hit and would certainly order again.  besides the fact that the food is wonderful - so are the staff.  they are very efficient and easy-going.  they have great recommendations and work very hard.</b_review>
<b_review>i've been here twice now for lunch with a co-worker and i'm obsessed.  first thing you notice is their huge salsa bar in the corner -- looks like they always have about 8-10 different kinds to try.  my favorites: strawberry, pecan and cilantro.  the whole place is decorated with dia de los muertos art everywhere -- very colorful and authentic.  next...the meals.  so far i've had the shrimp burro and some of my co-workers chicken mole quesa.  both were absolutely delicious -- melty fresh cheese, the mole sauce was unbelievable, and the shrimp burro was a great mix of cheese, an assortment of vegetables and a yummy sauce.  if this place was closer to my house i'd be there way more!</b_review>

<text>5 stars for the taste of the food.  2 stars for service.  yikes.  i'm allergic to peanuts.  i told the lady server this from the get-go, and she confidently stated she'd let the kitchen know and assured that no peanuts would reach the table.  of the 8 dishes we ordered, 7 were brought to the table garnished with peanuts.  7!  each time, the server would apologize and blame it on the kitchen.    i would be inclined to believe her, if it weren't for the crap service she provided otherwise.   we constantly had empty drinks, and at one point, during a particularly spicy dish, we ended up having to flag her down out of desperation.  the food did taste great though.  too bad i'll never come back because of the service/peanut concerns.</text>
<u_review>blech.  had the croque madame, and i agree with other people on here.  not enough sauce!  it was so dry tasting... thought i did like the bread they used.  i am also super lazy, and find the ordering at the counter thing to be confusing/irritating/ridiculous.  i totally wanted to love this place, but i really didn't.  will doubt i'll be back.</u_review>
<u_review>best fish?  nahhh best ambiance?  nahhh  super great happy hour prices!  yes! hooray!  only go during happy hour.  which is almost all the time.  this place is great if you're needin' some sushi and on a budget</u_review>
<u_review>i went here because i got a restaurants.com gc for this place! had never been before. i was very pleasantly suprised!  the salmon nigiri was so tender, velvety soft, and fresh tasting.  mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  i enjoyed the spicy scallop roll.  oh how i love popping those meaty, cold scallops between my teeth.  yum!  i have a nut allergy, and they were very accomodating and did not put macadamia nuts anywhere near my foods  :)  i shall return!</u_review>
<u_review>four stars for delicious margaritas and cornbread. i wasn't a fan of the mexican food here, to be honest.  i did enjoy the pork tenderloin stuffed with sausage though!</u_review>
<b_review>i went to dinner with a coworker while in town working a conference looking for some good asian food.  the food was great, the service was wonderful and the atmosphere was lovely.  i'm a big sake fan and they have quite the selection.  i had both a nigori (sayuri) and a ginjo (hakutsuru) - both very tasty :)  we ordered the spicy wonton, wasabi shumai, red curry crispy tofu with a side of jasmine rice and the spicy shrimp special.  everything was delicious.  the plates were perfect sizes for tapas and reasonably priced.  i will be back to try some more :)</b_review>
<b_review>well it almost feels redundant at this point after 168 reviews posted for sens, but for the love of sriracha this place was spectacular! once i got over the drool from reading the menu and actually tried several of the vegetarian options, i started scheduling my next visit. holy thai basil, the flavors were impressive. the taste was comforting and exotic at the same time and the dishes very visually pleasing.  the house infused vodkas and shochu are delicious. paired with the swanky semi-punk vibe, you've got a nice cocktail to wash down that sesame tofu. i did take one star for the disappointing okra. is that fair to take away a whole star for a vegetable nobody like anyway? i don't know. i love okra and i'm sad it wasn't given a fair presentation.   i'll definitely be bringing my out-of-towners here to show case the fancy food and funky atmosphere in phoenix.</b_review>
<b_review>this place is brilliant.   i've eaten here a few times and each time i leave my belly and heart sing pure joy after experiencing flavor explosions in my mouth.   i was in this week with a big group of friends, including a 1 yr. old (who loved the soba noodles btw) and this experience was no different. the guest of honor was a visiting nyc foodie, so she was in charge of ordering. after being here on "date night" and group dinners, i prefer the latter because the gluttony isn't so obvious.   i love ordering a fu-fu cocktail to start and sampling sake throughout the meal. this time it was the lychee mangoo- pretty tasty but not as great as the sweet karma my friend ordered. we moved on to pure sake ($14/btl) from there so my details may be fuzzy...   top picks:   beech mushrooms wrapped in bacon (not sure of the official name)- i don't care how much you may love the one you're with, you will not want to give them the last bite   red curry tofu claypot- order a side of rice with this to soak up that sauce. johnny chu has a way with tofu that is purely mystical.   cold duck salad- i may have to update my last meal request from my mother's albondigas to this salad   wasabi tofu- again, the tofu is mastery and even though i'm not a huge fan of wasabi, my friends are   soba noodles- just solo as a side they add a great layer to the meal and the kid loved 'em! i recommend getting 2 or 3 for the table.   things i wouldn't order again:   shu mai, napa rolls, hot rock beef- compared to the other items on the menu these were extremely bland...the sauce on the hot rock beef was a saver but the first two were buzz-kills.   the only reason this isn't 5 stars instead of 4 is because the service is hit and miss. i'm really partial to efficient, genuine service and sometimes it's pretty lackluster.   also, the portions are generous for tapas and the price is reasonable but all those fun drinks and tasty tidbits add up, so watch out.    overall, an amazing showcase of downtown talent and so worth the visit!</b_review>
<b_review>i have only been to sens once, but it definitely made its impression.  to my husbands disappointment i am not a huge fan of asian food. i enjoy it, but i don't live for it. my husband on the other hand could eat it morning noon and night. another contrast of our relationship is his love for all things seafood, and my resistance to eat anything that didn't grown up on land. despite these two short comings of my own, i was able to thoroughly enjoy sens.   i scanned the menu for everything chicken, beef, or pork and made my decisions from that. i ended up with the 5 spiced wings, the spicy wonton, and the sugar cane pork. i have to admit i could of probably eaten about 50 of the spicy wonton. crispy and delicious, and not to spicy for my pregnant palette.  the five spiced wings did not wow me and i ended up passing them along to the husband who devoured them. the wing itself lacked the crisp in the skin that i was looking for. the sugar can pork was interesting it was like a meat ball formed around a stick of sugar cane.i am not a pro at ordering tapas- i never know how much i really need to order. 3 plates ended up being more than i could handle, thankfully my husband was there to help.   this is a great place to enjoy a drink with friends, order for the table, and settle in to share the experience.</b_review>

<text>this place is a bit hard to find in the dark if you've never been. i ended up at the library but it's down the street a bit, tucked off the main street.   this place definitely caters to the 'hipster' crowd with a heavy dose of pretentiousness but i've come to expect that from more popular local coffee places. the interior is very modern (though not well-maintained). we came in right before closing so it wasn't busy at all but they still had plenty of baked items in the case. the barista that made our coffees was very nice when my mother asked what ristretto meant (how they make all their coffee drinks, as advertised on the menu) but the other barista seemed very aloof and non-engaging.   my overpriced small mocha would have been a lot better if they didn't use dark chocolate but that's all they had. is it more hip to use dark chocolate now? i'm a huge fan and frequenter of dutch bros. and if you can't compete flavour-wise with a drive-thru coffee place, it's probably time to re-evaluate.  seems like a good spot to hang out if you live in the area (and can find parking) but i would definitely not come back when there are better options in the same area.</text>
<u_review>got a maple butter crêpe with bananas, a cheesecake crêpe with strawberries and chocolate, and the lemon crêpe. when i checked in with yelp, i also got a free coffee. all the crêpes and the coffee were great - the maple butter one being my favourite and with the most flavour. the prices ($3.50 - $5) were reasonable for the size and ingredients as well.  the only problem i had was with the slow service. the cashier was writing all the orders down by hand really slowly and i stood there while she wrote the last person's order for a couple of minutes without much acknowledgement from her or the many people working behind the counter. the crêpes, something i have experience getting fairly quickly, took a pretty long time. my coffee was brought to my table without creamer or without being asked about cream and there was no cream at the self-serve bar - all of which i found odd. it was a good thing i had no where to be or i would have been pretty upset.   however, the taste of the crêpes outweighs any time inconvenience i experienced this visit. all the crêpes were exceptional and i might try to come back to sample the savoury offerings.</u_review>
<u_review>don't let the dive bar interior put you off. even as we walked in, a bar fight was about to happen, but that just added to the experience, right along with the sticky tables and low lighting. the waitress/bartender was really nice and both my mother and i got the burger and fries with sodas. the cook came over and asked us if we were sure we didn't want any add-ons so we just told her to throw some mushrooms on mom's and bacon on mine. she was a proper hole-in-the-wall fry cook with big hair. if laws didn't prohibit it, i have no doubt she'd have a cigarrette hanging from her lips. the food was a surprise. while extremely greasy (you're getting a burger and fries so never expect less), it was also extremely delicious. perfecly seared, thick-patty burger (with a unique tartness from the wine) on fresh bread with nice thick-cut bacon and great fries. it came with some onions and lettuce to top, also fresh.  a perfect example to never judge a book by its cover. there's a reason this place has won some "best of" awards.</u_review>
<u_review>had a great sandwich here the other week. got the doughboy which is turkey, bacon, swiss, and avocado on sliced sourdough, warmed up, and i added a side of chips and a can of soda - just under $8. also grabbed a slice of cheesecake for less than $2. everything was really fresh and the service was fast and friendly despite it being busy. there's a reason why this place has been around so long!  they also had a full menu of sliced meats and cheeses for those who prefer making their own sandwiches at home - plus shelves of imported products, seemingly mostly from sweden. it was nice to see some things i haven't seen since i lived in finland.  i can't wait to come back and try the turkonberry or the wild turkey sandwiches. both sound amazing!</u_review>
<u_review>they roast their own espresso and the bags smelled great but the place itself didn't have a distinct smell. kind of disappointing, they must have an amazing air flow system. a lot of vegan bakery options, but since i'm not into that, there wasn't much for me here. my chocolate chip muffin was pretty good, though. my latte wasn't that great - i should have gone with a mocha. overall, a typical local coffee place that caters to the hip.</u_review>
<b_review>a few lessons learned after my trip to giant.  lesson #1 to business owners--take credit cards.  i don't carry cash.  if you don't take credit, then you lose my business.  i will never understand why a business would not want to accept all possible means of payment.  lesson #2 to business owners--rather than turn me away for only having credit, it seems a better course would be to give me a free or reduced coffee (i did have a buck on me) on this visit.  this way you maintain goodwill, and i learn to have cash next time.  when lola's credit machine went down, they gave me a free coffee.  you know what i did?  i went back many, many times.  i also paid them for that coffee they fronted me.  lesson #3 to business owners--when you fail lessons 1 and 2, people write negative reviews on yelp.  granted, this single review will never overcome the current hipster hard-on for giant.  but in 3 months there will be some new place for them to go.  meanwhile, i will still be living and working within a short bike ride of you.  i also make and spend a lot of money.  kudos to whoever designed the space.</b_review>
<b_review>mixed feelings. the atmosphere and vibe is pretty cool and they have one of the best breakfast burritos that i have had in a long time. i was not excited, though, by paying $2.25 (+ tax) on what comparatively was a medium sized drip coffee but i figured not a big deal but i was shocked when they charged $1 (again + tax) for a refill. not cool.  but i do give them major props for using an ipad for credit card charges - you sign for it with your finger and then the system text messages you with a link to your receipt. nice!</b_review>
<b_review>this place has a great atmosphere and good location. they care more about the coffee than the sweeteners added to the coffee which i appreciate. i would have given them 5 stars if they took debit! i completely agree with not using debit and credit cards however that cost can be passed to the customer if they want. that would at least let them make the sale. anyway... they had a vanilla honey coffee that was very good. not too sweet so it let the coffee flavor shine through. i would definitely recommend this place, just remember to bring cash!</b_review>
<b_review>well, been wanting to try giant coffee for some time now, and a day off during the week and the need to go to los olivos car wash sent me flying and found it with ease but needed to illegally park in the cvs parking lot because as with most hip trendy cenpho places, there is no real parking alert*  i'm not shouting really.  it was nice, they had the wide doors open to the outside and with the weather not  being 118, it felt good.  oh, they had the obligatory hip-tards with spiked hair on mac books wearing vests and looking self-important and all that, but they didn't know the term "skinny".  huh???  wait, isn't skinny an official batista term for sugar free, skim milk?  after explaining the concept to the nice man behind the counter, he informed me that they have no sugar free vanilla syrup but did have skim milk.  ok no problem, well not really.  ordered a skinny (with sugar vanilla syrup), hot latte.  i sat and peeked about the cute bunky boutique next door and accidental purchased a line of men's skin care products by baxter.  hard to resist a new skin care product (twss).  came back and drank my (fool me with the coffee art leaf on top of the creme alert****) vanilla latte.  it was good, but not that hot and kind of small for $4.  i will definitely check it out again, but no rush to rush back.  if i lived close by, i would certainly go more often and try another type of espresso drink.    one star deduction for cash only!!  nothing irritates me more than cash only in 2012. one star deduction for lack of parking and kind of wimpy espresso drink.  ps only open until 7 pm, really in a major city???  yikes another wimpy hours coffee shop that won't man up and act like they are in a real city.....this isn't mayberry folks!</b_review>

<text>there are so many reasons this place is a failure, even though i am so so thankful for the existence (though not the idiotic design and planning) of the amc 24 here.  full of 2nd-rate restaurants and trinket shops, it just doesn't have much draw.  (sam's cafe is really the only restaurant here that i go to much.)  rather than putting the theater (blank walls) in the center with the shops and restaurants around it to create a vibrant urban space, they killed the street-facing ability of much of this block by turning it outside-in and into a little suburban "enter me and leave the city" area.   you combine that with the concept of 2nd floor retail (again a suburban mall concept), and this place is a complete failure.  notice nothing exists on the 2nd floor.  even if it had 3x the foot-traffic nothing could survive up there, because no one would ever see anything on a 2nd floor in-passing on their way to something else and thereby never "discover" it.  whoever conceived and built this "center" should be tarred, feathered, and forced to live in anthem.  actually, judging by the design, they probably do live in anthem.</text>
<u_review>scale of 1-10 (multiple visits): 9 food 7 *drinks* 6 service 9 atmosphere 5 value  the duce is up, and the duce is down.  i love this place, and have been many times, but i'm also an honest dude and to say the duce has a few kinks to work out is an understatement.  the food, of which i've had the scramble, noodle kugel, honey cheesecake, chicken sliders (style of bread is too hard), pear+pecan salad, is all delicious.  but the bar, which is generally a big part of my experience, needs to be able to work a little faster, and i think a big part of that will be reducing  how much muddling goes on.  also don't get wine here.  all drinks here are served in a mason jar.  that's cool for mixed drinks.  but doesn't work for wine.  but as has been mentioned many times over already, this is a really cool space with the hodgepodge of concepts within one larger one.    the bones and the vibe and the food is here.  but so far so are the kinks.  please kinks, go away.</u_review>
<u_review>scale of 1-10 (multiple visits): 7 food 8 service 8 atmosphere 4 value  half the things i've had here are amazing - the other half are average; but the prices make even the amazing things hard for me to justify.  then there's the fact that they are a part of the trendy problem of over-frosting cupcakes.  the way cupcakes are treated today by "artisan" bakeries, you'd think they were called cupfrostings.  tammy coe: guilty.</u_review>
<u_review>scale of 1-10 (single visit): 7 food 9 service 6 atmosphere 7 value  standard atmosphere deduction for the television atrociously breaking up what would otherwise have been a nice quaint place.    the dessert (thairamisu) was excellent and unique.  the massaman was really good, it just had too much chicken and not enough vegetables.  i know i read other reviews saying "where was the protein?", but really i expect the protein to accent the dish, not to overwhelm it.  i wanted more veggies.  the green curry was the same, overproteined with not enough veggies, especially bamboo, but its flavor also wasn't quite as good as some other thai places i've been to (swaddees & yupha).  the thai veggie rolls were greatness.  the location is super though, so i expect that if i ever succeed in moving downtown, i'll eat here fairly frequently.  unlike most other reviews on here, my portions were large.  maybe they did lunch, b/c i went for dinner.</u_review>
<u_review>scale of 1-10 (multiple visits): 6 food 5 *drinks* 7 service 7 atmosphere 7 value  i don't dig this place, i don't hate this place.  it's alright, but not special.  the menu seems challenging to maneuver for some reason, and the drinks are lackluster.  but there is creativity here and i appreciate that and can enjoy exploring and experiencing it after i've gotten past the first obstacles i mentioned.  it's location is also a bit off the light rail and on an uber ped-unfriendly road (7th st), so it's not somewhere i make it to very often.  btw: the happy hours here are pretty good.</u_review>
<b_review>me and the mrs were looking for a place to kill some time while waiting to catch a plane home from az. so we figured we would look on yelp for a mall to stroll through. we came across the arizona center an saw it was near the airport so we figured we would give it a shot. what a let down! this place is far from what i consider a mall or even a strip mall. a few whack ass stores and some meager restaurants. to top it off we had to pay to park there. lame! won't be wasting our time here again.</b_review>
<b_review>needed a quick bite across the street after i landed at the sheraton. in short, some interesting stores and restaurants all just thrown together. i think it could be so much more. a subway, pizzeria uno, hooters, and amc then a ny & co. my fiancee would like the latter, but i'm thinking "well what the..."  for quick food come here; and don't get me wrong, next time i might try the uno, as i love the one in chi-town. but i get this feeling it's not really a mall or a center and just a few places crammed together to make the tourists feel at home, but i didn't feel at home. this place was sooo empty!!!</b_review>
<b_review>jeez, i didn't know this place was still alive until i moved back.  i think it's safe to say that this shopping center was a failed experiment in bringing people back to downtown. sure, alot of people are slowly trickling back to the center of the city, but not as a result of this. the lifeblood of this place tends to be the suit types that swing in for happy hour at hooters or other bars that think that interior design is bolting an rusty route 66 sign to the wall.  if this place didn't have a movie theater, i'd brand this place with one star.</b_review>
<b_review>seems to always be cycling out old places and in the new.  hard to keep up, but at least there are always options..</b_review>

<text>i am so happy the snow craze has finally made it to arizona! i have had snow at a couple places in california, so when this opened we knew it was a must try! i knew it would be successful in phoenix, well...because it get so damn hot! we came here opening week and got there at the perfect time because after we got our order the line got crazy and went out the door! i recommend everything! my favorite is mango, taro  flavored snow with the mango popper thingys! we even tried to black sesame syrup, that i'll admit i doubted, but it was really good! this is close to my sisters house so i hope to come back again when we're in the area.</text>
<u_review>zinburger....eh, it's alright. i can't help but think about how much i liked delux way more. it's not a bad burger but i ordered the el diablo kobe burger and failed to see what was so special. i paid an extra $5 for it to be kobe and was excited to taste the difference, and honestly neither me or my bf were able to tell. i was also excited about the truffle fries (since they are my favorite fries at the yard house), but they turned out to be mediocre also. they have great aiolli sauces but that was the only thing that really stood out. its a nice setting, very clean and classy, we were able to watch some college football from our booth. i would eat here again if a friend wanted to go, but otherwise i will probably go elsewhere next time i want a gourmet burger.</u_review>
<u_review>i would say red kimchi deserves a 3 maybe 3.5 rating based on my experience. i was looking for somewhere to take my fiance out for his birthday and stumbled upon this korean restaurant on yelp. i called and made a reservation for a table with the tabletop grill. when we got there we found that he had given our table away, although he apologized i was still annoyed and we ended up having to wait another 10 minutes or so (why even make a reservation?!). being from california i have been to my share of table top cooking korean restaurants and they usually have the large rectangular grill that you can put lots of meat on at once. red kimchi had a small round grill that seemed to cook unevenly. i asked for a thai iced tea and the waiter stated that it wasn't good and i shouldn't order it and i awkwardly said..ummm...ok nevermind. so we order the galbi short ribs and the spicy korean pork. the waiter (who i think was the owner) came back with the raw meat and explained that he goes out himself to select the best angus beef for his short ribs. that was a nice little story and the meat was very good quality. i must say the portion was very small for the price paid, $20 for 3 pieces of short ribs. this is not usually the case when i have gone to my korean bbq spots in california but this is arizona and there aren't many korean restaurants around. the spicy pork was very good and the portion was decent. the restaurants i've been to in the past usually have a lot of kimchi and appetizer sides don't know the proper name) and i was hoping for those cold clear noodles, but it never came. we just got a couple of mediocre pickled items (maybe 3 or 4) and some kimchi lettuce. they did bring out a nice little dessert for his birthday which was yummy. the thing i love the most about going to korean restaurants with tabletop grills is the fun of cooking it. i didn't get to do any cooking because the waiter popped in every two minutes to snatch the tongs and mess with our food, which is fine if i didn't want to do it. overall the food was pretty good but maybe ill stick to going to a hawaiian place for my short rib cravings.</u_review>
<u_review>i love the arizona canal!! my favorite thing about arizona (besides eric m.) is the outdoor workouts that are available, mainly because i am an active person but i can't stand gyms. along with hiking camelback/piewesta peak and running tempe town lake, running or biking the canal is one of my favorite fun and free workouts that we do around town. when the weather is hot, the water from the canal provides some relief. the city has been great by providing lighting for the pathways and i feel extremely safe whether we're riding/running during the day or after dark. the canal can lead to a number of places but i love heading to o.h.s.o. they have bike parking right off the canal or if you're walking your dog, they welcome your four-legged friends onto the patio area where they supply free water and treats (plus they have amazing food and beer). we have biked from our part of town by arcadia to mill ave and old town scottsdale a bunch.. great way to get around without having to pay for parking!</u_review>
<u_review>this bosa donuts is my favorite local donut shop in arizona. i stop here in the mornings sometimes on my way to work (if i leave early enough). i love that they have a drive-thru and the customer service is wonderful every time. they always get your order out super fast, i'm usually out of there in less than 3 minutes! i usually stop by around 7:30 and i think that's when the donuts are fresh because they come out so warm, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. i always get a maple bar and a cappuccino to go along with it (warning: cappuccino is scolding hot!). they have a lot of different things on their menu that i want to try one day just haven't ventured off to do yet. their croissants filled with ham and cheese looks amazing and if its quality is anywhere near their quality of donuts, i'm down. they also have boba drinks that i am curious to try, considering donut shops don't usually serve boba i am not expecting it to wow me, but if it does more power to bosa! i had my favorite donut shop growing up in california that i always went out of my way to go to and i was so happy to find one here! bosa donuts, you will be the fat death of me, but i forgive you. because you are delicous and filled with happiness.</u_review>
<b_review>5/29/13  winding down from the cmye at del frisco's, someone brought up an impromptu uye at snoh ice shavery, and since i've never been and had been craving for shave ice, such as that i experienced in honolulu, i needed no other prompting to go.  snoh is located in the same plaza as cherry blossom noodle cafe (another bookmark i've had since moving into the valley many, many years ago- now i know where it's located, i'm going to have to stop in for a try!)  parking looks very decent for the number of businesses around here- a big plus!  the line can get long very fast, but the two guys behind the counter take the orders very quickly (or as quickly as they can when newbies, such as myself, come in for the first time and are faced with so many choices!).  i decided to take the easy way out and try a couple of shaved ice flavors and a few toppings, so i went with the "large plate" for $6.75.  i spent my first decade, born and raised, in manila, so i am very familiar with taro (we tagalogs know it as "ube") ice cream, so i had to try snoh's icy version, and added green tea to the mix.  my toppings were cubed mango, red mung beans, and black sesame condensed milk.  it took about 8 to 10 minutes, but we had a large group present, and our lively conversations made the wait very easy.  this is what waited for me at the counter when my name was called... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/snoh-ice-shavery-phoenix?userid=m9rrm6eo5ybklkmg5qiipa#jyv16lcycfb3cz-q3ckdxg  i have to say that while it didn't look very appetizing (mango cubes didn't present well, and neither did the black sesame drizzle-- why not just pour the milk, let it cascade down the icy landscapes, and just sprinkle roasted black sesame seeds on top?), i loved the taro, red mung bean, and black sesame condensed milk combo.  i thought the condensed milk overpowered the green tea ice, and i wouldn't order that match again.  however, i wouldn't mind having ust green tea ice.  it tasted very fresh and clean-- a great palate cleanser after a great meal.  cool artwork and backsplashes.  nice concept of posting photos of guests on the tv display, but does the staff check for total complacency of all those present in the pics, i wonder?  i can see privacy breaches becoming an issue...   will be taking family over for a few treats here in the future, i'm sure!</b_review>
<b_review>wonderful little shop. staff is amazingly kind and helpful. i had never tried anything like their shaved ice cream, but it was wonderfully delicious and fluffy. i would definitely recommend trying it out.</b_review>
<b_review>i have to say omg delicious!  i am love frozen yogurt, so i wasn't sure what to expect from this kind of ice cream.  it is light, flavorful and delicious. i shared my ice cream with my date and i wish i would have gotten my own! i had the taro flavor with condensed milk.  that topping is a must!  when i'm in the area, i will be back here.</b_review>
<b_review>finally, a good boba place in central phx! i'm giving it four stars for not having more tea flavors (there's only about 4 flavors each for milk tea and for regular tea) but overall i've enjoyed the boba teas i've tried there.  i personally like their thai tea and taro tea - have not tried the almond or milk tea flavors.  i've tried the snoh but i'm not as big a fan as i am of boba in general.  i like that the boba has been consistently chewy every time i order it and that the tea is well mixed - no granules at the bottom of my cup.  my husband can't bring himself to deviate from the snoh - he mixes it up all the time, but he tends to get the thai snoh or the original flavor and puts mochi, strawberries, and black sesame glaze.  we love the location (super enabling since it's 10 mins away from our place) and usually don't have to wait too long for our order.  it's in the same center as cherry blossom cafe, tokyo express, and a few other relatively busy places, so parking can be a premium at peak food times.  we've usually gone on the weekend or towards the end of the day and have only had a problem finding a spot once or twice.  try not to look for a spot in the front - go to the left and park towards the back.  you'll get your fix faster and with less stress!</b_review>

<text>ok we got to this place 15 mins and they didn't open till 11am they opened early to let us out of the 100+ heat, nice guys :) we went inside to a very pleasing to the eyes burger shop. i was blown away by their soda machines with touch screen, very futuristic. the cup was fries was enough for 2 people and the burgers were large, juicy, fresh, and full of flavor. they would be a 5 stars if their prices were 1 dollar less. but overall i would gladly return very good food.</text>
<u_review>wow i dont know what to say about this mcdonald's location or any of the ones in queen creek for that matter. it seems like there is never enough people working here or they are just really slow. i mean i have waited here for up to 30 mins waiting for my food, the coffee they make here is very bad, the smoothies are even worse. only thing that bring me back here is treating my daughter to some chicken nuggets once in a while but i refuse to eat here.</u_review>
<u_review>french fries with mexican food lol classic. get the big fat chicken taco and you will be eating the best taco offered from del taco :) also the fries are rather good i was just messing around.</u_review>
<u_review>it was a quick trip downtown from mesa, i didnt like some of the people getting on the train but hey its public transport. my legs were also hurting from the seats on the short trip downtown i have rls and man it hurt for days after. it was great for saving gas and if i worked by one i would take it daily. this was my first time so watch where you park by the pickup locations cause i got my car towed, $200 fine!!! i would take it downtown again but park in the right spot this time.</u_review>
<u_review>it was a quick trip to check my daughter after an accident at home, it was a very fast er to dr visit and the entire trip was less than one hour. people were friendly and everything was explained in detail. it was very clean and they have a very nice setup for a new hospital. if you have ever been to banner gateway its almost the very same layout. in the future i would not mind taking a trip back here but i am in no hurry if you know what i am saying. its a great place to be near to your house a state of art facillity.</u_review>
<b_review>i have eaten there a few times. and the burgers are pretty good and they give you a crazy amount of fries. my daughter loves the soda machine. but it is over priced so we would eat there more if it was cheaper.</b_review>
<b_review>5 guys opened up about 2 years ago and i have always received very consistent taste and service from this location  it is situated right next to rumbi's island grill and i always struggle with healthy food or greasy food for lunch. it's a 50/50 coin toss on which one i end up walking into. (i do however prefer the 5 guys burger to the rumbi's burger) what i would pass on is the california pizza kitchen next door, man has this chain gone down hill, talk about a rip off.  5 guys burgers & fries are cooked fresh to order, another words you have to wait for them. they cook in the open ... right in front of you ... not sure what some of these other reviews are on about.  they use fresh potatoes for their fries and fry them in peanut oil at at higher temperature than normal vegetable oil, they come out very crunchy and golden brown. they kick butt all over in & out french fries imo, and 1 order is enough for 2 people.   their burgers are twice as thick as in & out, twice as tasty imo, and a good value when you consider the amount of toppings and meat you receive. i also like munching those "free" peanuts and tossing the shells on the floor while i wait for my order.  i guess i am a fan of 5 guys burgers,  also a fan of smash burgers, and delux too.                            all different, all good ... depends on my mood!</b_review>
<b_review>my first time here i didn't think it was as good as all the hype people told me about it, but the bext few times i realized their burger is amazing and the fries are the best thing.  be sure to order the regular fries, you get a large portion.</b_review>
<b_review>i saw a story on the tv about this place and decided to give it a try. it was a good burger. it is bit pricey but oh well. it was juicy and had good flavor and the fries were tasty too. not reinventing the wheel by any means but my burger tasted good and that's what it's all about.</b_review>

<text>i've been waiting for this place to open with super high hopes, and it looks like it will live up to expectations.  bliss:  as dave b said, we were only able to try a couple of appetizers, but they were delicious.  the coconut chicken is in a plum sauce, and was divine.  a full order of it would make a perfect meal, and at $7 isn't bad at all.  almost all of the appetizers looked just as good.  the menu isn't terribly huge, which seems to be a growing trend.  everything sounds good though; there are a few salads, two burgers, two mac and cheese options, and a couple of other entrees.  they all fell in the $8-$13(ish) range.    finally, there are a couple of great looking desserts, and a saturday and sunday brunch of french toast, eggs, and the usual.  the place itself is such a great space... the majority of seating is outdoors on the patio, and indoors it's a very clean and modern feel but still bright and sunshiny.  as for the rebar side, i really think it's going to be a hit.  the patio is one of the best views and best looking places downtown, and i'm guessing the inside bar will be the hot new place very soon.  it's got all the coolness of the roosevelt, plus hard liquor in addition to beer and wine.  there were no tables or chairs yet, so i'm not sure what the vibe will be... it looks like it could be a low-lit swanky place with loud music and dancing, or it could turn into a more casual and comfortable hangout.  either way, it looks like it's going to be just what i was hoping for... they'll have their own parking lot soon, so cross your fingers for bliss/rebar to become a destination restaurant of the sort we desperately need downtown.</text>
<u_review>after all this time, i finally made it to ticoz.  2 friends and i showed up on a tuesday at about 6:20, and while the dining room and patio were full, we settled in at the bar with no trouble (and let's face it... may as well stay as close to the booze as possible).  our waiter was kind enough to rush over and let us know that happy hour was just about to end, if we wanted to get a drink order in.  oddly enough, we did want a drink!  i ordered a mojito, which is always a favorite of mine.  they have all sorts of fancy ones, but i just wanted a plain jane mojito.  not only was it delicious and only $3, it was big!  one of my friends swears by the sangria, and the other had a fancy mojito and loved it too.  we opted to just split some appetizers.  we ordered the cinnamon dusted chicken flautas, beef empanadas, and a side of corn crusted (something like that) fries.   the fries were very good, but they were just fries.  i'm not sure what i was expecting, but i guess i thought it would be totally different than regular fries.  the beef empanadas were very good; it's just shredded beef cooked up in puff pastry.  a very simple idea, and one i plan to try at home sometime soon.  the beef was a little bland, but it was a very filling and satisfying little treat.  but now for the best... the cinnamon chicken flautas.  hoooooooooooooooooooooooly cow did i love those things.  i've already been back once since, and i know i should try other things, but i couldn't resist.  i've found myself craving them at the oddest times.  they are just shredded chicken wrapped in a tortilla, cooked and rolled around in cinnamon.  sounds weird, but absolutely wonderful.  i want to give it 5 stars for those flautas and mojitos, but based on the other two items (and until i try something else there) and their terrible, terrible tostitos tortilla chips, i'm going to stick it at a 4.  a++++ would eat it again!</u_review>
<u_review>hanny's... are you mad?  turns out i couldn't quit you so easy after all.  we went back to hanny's on a wednesday night around 6.  totally different vibe.  the dj was gone, the music was appropriate, and it seemed like hanny's had decided to be a restaurant after all.  filled to the brim with suits having an after work bite and cocktail, it just looked.... right.  classy but still simple and quick.  the service was about 5 million times better than our first visit, too.  i still have my complaint about the menu.  pretty small selection, and it seems like what selection you do have is mostly the same ingredients rearranged in different ways.  but since i feel like i could eat the blanco pizza over and over without getting tired of it, i will still want to keep coming back.</u_review>
<u_review>i am a bad, bad person.  i discovered fez very shortly after moving here 3 years ago, and have never reviewed it.  but i promise you, i have made up for this  by recommending it to everyone i know.  whenever anyone asks where's good to go, fez is my answer.  everything here is spot on.  my personal favorite is the casablanca chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries, but i adore the kibis, the rosemary fries, the burger, the salads, the soup, some lettuce wrap something that thomas served us, the kisris, and the martinis, oh lord save me from the martinis.  sadly, i have not stopped by for brunch, nor have i ever had any dessert.  but seeing as how there has not been one single thing that i've tried there that i didn't absolutely love, i'm sure they're wonderful, and i'll correct this injustice next time i go.  the ambience and decor are wonderful, service is good, prices are good.  fez has been my go-to spot since the first time i went, and i doubt that will ever change.  it's great for a nice date, it's perfect for a gaggle of girlfriends, and as i recently found out with dave, it's even lovely for a lazy late lunch on a sunday when you can't bring yourself to get dressed up.  yay fez!!</u_review>
<u_review>given its location and surroundings (postino's, fancy little grocery, etc), lgo is surprisingly casual inside, which i actually enjoyed.  there seemed to be a decent selection of wine (sorry, i didn't pay attention to the beer list) and if they don't have what you want, you can grab a bottle at the grocery and drink that.  i had the sangria, but didn't really love it.  the pizza though, oi, so yummy.  we had just cheese and sausage, and it was delicious.  i was a little iffy ordering sausage as i'm pretty picky about it, but it was great.  had i not been trying to be a little ladylike, i could see myself scarfing down most of a whole pizza.   i also have bumped lgo to the top of my list of good places to take out of town guests, especially pickier eaters.  who doesn't love pizza?  update:  the roasted corn pizza is fantastic.</u_review>
<b_review>bliss is really really really good. perfect pork chop, fantastic mac n cheese, great service, great pricing, quiet and good service the couple of times i've been. i need to try a few more things before i bump this up to 5 stars, but it's essentially a 5 star in my mind.  was really pleased with this place.</b_review>
<b_review>i have been going to bliss rebar before it was bliss. it was fate then! i was elated when a friend and co-worker invited me to his soft opening. i have been going and in love with bliss since. i've always loved the outside bar. last week my friends had their dinner club party there. awesomeness that i was invited. as i was just there to celebrate my company's agreement passing hosted by bliss! i took my then new-ish boyfriend to 'haze' him, if you will to my flight attendant world. he fit right in and loved bliss too. i particularly love bliss nachos. scott loves bliss mac&cheese balls. we may have ordered two orders that party night. too many strong ketel drinks make it all hazy!  last week at dinner club i had the street tacos. amazing. a few of us shared the hummus plate and again, the nachos with chicken. several drinks. i actually had the waiter bring me seltzer to soften the strong of my vodka drink! where does that ever happen! my boyfriend had the mac&cheese entree this time. holy heaven. i even tasted it. yum. the only thing we disliked. the panna cotta. on the menu it stated it was with marcerated berries. it came with kiwi fruit and it was too hard to be called 'panna cotta'. which is an italian cream that is cooked just until it becomes a bit thick and congealed just a little less than the consistency of a custard. this was beyond jello as we have in the us. so the waiter took it away and off our bill with no question. he was gracious and nothing but sweet.  i would not ever rate bliss less than a 5 because so many things about bliss are above par. all of our friends desserts and meals were raved about. it's a super trendy, fun and hip place. great people watching! awesome sunday brunch too!!!</b_review>
<b_review>i've been to bliss/rebar twice now and really enjoyed myself. the food is great (love their parmesan fries), service is always spot on, and its super cute. can't wait to sit outside once it cools down. the only bummer is that the two times i've been, they haven't been as busy as they deserve to be! definitely a must the next time you are downtown.</b_review>
<b_review>these guys do a great job! very good food and a very professional, friendly staff. refreshing after the slew of mediocre restaurants that were there before.</b_review>

<text>i am one of those people that talk crap about gordon biersch behind its back but i'm nice to its face. i go there and continue having expensive yet mediocre meals, but like i just said- i go there. my boyfriend asked me once "why do it to yourself when you don't enjoy it? " i don't know. maybe i'm a masochistic eater. actually, i'm just very agreeable and i work super closeby. and if i didn't go there i would just walk over to whole foods and spend a zillion dollars on a goulash-y takeout container that i don't even like after i pay for it. for me, lunch is more about getting out and doing something else for an hour a day. if someone wants to go to gb i will happily tag along and probably eat, even though i know i wont like it. at least there's not much harm in that, except to my wallett! ps- lori is the nicest, sweetest server/bartender ever and chatting with her makes up for the crappy food!</text>
<u_review>i woke up wanting both mexican and sushi, so what's a girl to do but go to moto! i remembered their asian nachos and before stepping foot out of bed visions of them were dancing in my head! i was kind of worried bc i know saturdays they have the all u can eat sushi thing and i've heard it gets packed and service is slow, but the nachos on my brain were too hard to ignore so we pressed on!  it was near-full, but we were seated and had a small chicken nachos in no time! so flippin good i can't even tell you! the sauce is like half bbq half hot sauce, and it's fantastic! we got an extra side of that and of sriracha (bc sauce, to me, is a must-have).  we decided to go with the a.y.c.e. deal, and i ordered 4 rolls and 2 kinds of nigiri. our server then turned to my companion and asked what he would like?!?!?!? huh? i'm not a competitive eater! i had ordered for both of us. she got all bristly, and i told her we knew that each person pays 18.95 for ayce, and we were cool with that, but just ordering together. it was a big deal that needn't be, but whatev's.   i'm not a fan of smoked salmon, but the vegas roll was still good. fry anything and it works. the tootsie was our favorite and the spicy yellowtail our least. we couldn't finish our order and didn't order anything else. our server said she felt bad for charging us both the ayce price when we only ordered one plate, but she had no problem doing it. they must have a lot of losers coming in trying to feed the whole fam at one price i guess. not so cool for us normal people. i will be back for those damn nachos, but probably won't ever do the ayce again. if you can pack it away-go for it, if not-just stick with what you like and avoid the drama.</u_review>
<u_review>this location has been so many different restaurants in the past few years and now there is finally a good one! it's basically a fancied-up paradise bakery with better food, bread, and condiments. oh and better prices too. i had a small chipotle chicken salad and a small tortilla soup and that was a good amount of food- with a drink, for only $10.58. the soup was great! and they let me sample several kinds before making my decision. i also loved that they had at least a dozen different kinds of hot sauce bottles on the wall that customers are free to use as they please. i tried three because i like to bring the heat and because they were available.    my only complaint was that the dirty dish bin was overflowing even though the place was super slow. can't someone handle that? its gross to have to move other people's dirty dishes around in order to fit yours in there. ts seems like an easy thing to fix- someone pick up dirty dishes every couple of hours or something.</u_review>
<u_review>we had cob for a work lunch the other day and it left much to be desired. i did like the guacamole and the hotter salsa, but not much else. well, the rice wasnt bad either. maybe it was the whole to go thing, but it wasnt very good. and the sour cream had black things in it? olives? i dont know, but i didnt find out.</u_review>
<u_review>i procrastinated on making easter reservations and wound up coming here with the bf. inside it looks like you are at someones wedding reception at a nice catering hall- nice, but unoriginal.  all of the staff were very kind and helpful and we soon got down to business. the salad bar was my garden of eden! mushrooms, beets, humongous asparagus spears (genetically altered, perhaps?;) ) the basil dressing? amazing. i loved it, and even my veggie-shy man enjoyed some of it's offerings (bread and butter!).   time to get meaty! i have never had so much hot meat in front of me at one time! we quickly learned what we liked (filet and ny strip for me) and what we didn't (bottom sirloin still visits me in bad dreams). i tried two pieces of chicken that were both hard as rocks and a pork sasuage  that was ggggross! i had more uneaten meat on my plate than i had consumed, so after about 20 minutes i cut off the meat flow and went back for seconds at the salad garden.  before leaving, we finally saw the lamb chops coming around. i love them and had to try them. my first bite was pretty decent. but each subsequent one was fattier than the next. blech! enough for me.   i will mention the sides, although they were truthfully unmentionable. the "crispy polenta" was overcooked and greasy, the plantains looked nasty but tasted ok. the potatoes were the best of the worst, and we actually ate them. but overall, the sides aren't worth the room in your belly. we had none left, and therefore passed on dessert.  i'd go back for the salad bar, it alone costs $20, but i think it's worth it. everything else, meh.</u_review>
<b_review>just had dinner here with my mom. our waitress was very kind and attentive to all that we asked. (woohoo!)  the food was great and very satisfying. i had the steak-frites, which was excellent. perfectly cooked, which is rare these days. the atmosphere was nice and i got to watch the sun's reflection over the mcdowell mountains in the east as it went down, absolutely beautiful.   dessert wasn't the best, but that's okay. now i need to go running to burn off the intense amount of food intake i had at gordon biersch!</b_review>
<b_review>went there after a not-so-good experience at a local tap room and it was great. i had a great burger (classic with jalapenos) and a jamey and ginger. service (hostess and server) and food were both fantastic.</b_review>
<b_review>i've been to this location about 10 times. it is one of a few gastro pubs in the scottsdale area and the food is consistently good.  though their beer is actually brewed on the other side of town they have the usual gb beers and they are very well brewed representations of their respective styles. my favorite are the crisp czech pils to start and then the roasty schwartzbier toward the end of the meal and desert. some time after thanksgiving they have a seasonal boch that is a wonderful malt bomb.  some of my fellow beer nerds pan them for not having a hop bomb on the menu, but they are missing that gordon biersch does traditional german styles and they do them very well--all of them are lagers except the hefe and an altbier that i may have had seasonally.</b_review>
<b_review>summerbrau is light, lots of citrus, low alcohol% and 40%-off menu specials before 4pm  --hummus and goat cheese salad with chicken; it's worth the trip. --wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon is my comfort food. --mean garlic fries; use caution. --gorgonzola potato wedges, $1 extra, but so good. --rib-eye, though most expensive on the menu, is awesome, and it's with a pile of mashed potatoes and veggies. --specials may have expired by the time you read this, but rigatoni, corned-beef reuben are my favorites from the 40%-off menu. --check the burger specials, (though if you're a purist, the beef patties arrive frozen) --veggie or pepperoni pizza, but order it extra crispy --staff is always extremely friendly, helpful, will fix anything without question, so don't be afraid to ask if you have a request --cool shot-glass desserts, if that's your thing.  if only they'd have freedom to use fresh ingredients to create "chef's specials"; i'm sure they'd be great.</b_review>

<text>if i were an undergraduate at asu and/or under the age of 21, i would probably love tempe marketplace. it's got a lot of stores that those groups would love to shop in...gap, buckle, pac sun, old navy and charlotte russe just to name a few.  plus there are a lot of restaurants and places to eat, which would be appealing i suppose.  the only reason i go to tempe marketplace is for target and best buy because they are the closest to my house.  we tried the movie theatre over there last night...big mistake. not only were there tons of teeny-boppers just walking around and "hanging out" (remember when you went to the mall and movie theatre in middle school and high school just to hang out?? god, i can't believe i ever did that), but parking was horrible, as it is ever time i go to the marketplace.  lastly, i don't find tempe marketplace walkable for such an "outdoor destination". old navy, pier 1, target, famous footwear are over here and the movie theater, restaurants, and mall type stores are way over there. it is way too spread out to just park once and then walk everywhere you might want to go.</text>
<u_review>i went with two friends to china chili for lunch this afternoon. it was very meh. i had the chicken salad (chicken breast, lettuce, cilantro with hot mustard and sesame oil) and a side of white rice. it was very bland. if it had hot mustard and sesame oil on it, i totally missed it. the rice wasn't cooked well at all...seriously, wtf? the soup that came out beforehand was nothing to write home about. my two dining companions had the tofu and said it was not very filling at all and that is was just ok.    the lunch menu is not very large and to me seems to be quite lacking in some staple chinese dishes that you would expect. the prices were pretty standard for a chinese restaurant. thankfully service was fast and pleasant.</u_review>
<u_review>i am giving la canasta 4 stars mainly because of location and their chips.    i work in the executive tower at the capitol and if you have been in that area, then you know that there are like no options for lunch other than the cafeteria at the des building or the cafeteria in the basement of the executive tower. frankly, there are some days where we want to escape the building but don't want to risk going downtown, which makes la canasta a great option for those days.  also, if you want political gossip, la canasta is a great place because you can see the whos-who in politics at lunch and possibly overhear some good tidbits. or you'll just hear staffers like myself and co-workers complaining about our jobs!  as i mentioned previously, the chips and salsa are delicious at la canasta, but the rest of the food is just ok. it's nothing spectacular that warrants a special trip.  soda and iced tea are $2.25 (unlimited refills) which is a tad high in my book.  the patio is nice to sit on especially when your office has no windows.  however, today upon leaving, we saw three birds on a table eating off some plates that were sitting on an empty table. i could have done without seeing that.</u_review>
<u_review>as a happy hour destination, la bocca is a very good option on mill. wine by the glass, draft beer and well liquor (listed in the drink menu) is all half off, as are bud light and coors light bottles. the bar is nice and service is friendly and attentive. as a dinner option, however, i think you can do better. i am not super impressed with the food i have tried at la bocca...the caesar salad was just ok and i've had better caprese sandwiches other places (note: the caprese sandwich is no longer on the menu...there is a caprese salad though).   three stars as a dinner option and four stars as a happy hour destination, giving la bocca 3. 5 stars. however, i'll round up to four because i value places with good happy hour specials; plus la bocca is a nice addition to mill avenue and a good place to escape when you want a more grown up night out on mill.</u_review>
<u_review>what a find in a strip mall! the inside is warm and cozy, and i love the open air dining room and patio. like ashley a. and kristin s. said, the live music, while good, was much too loud. carrying on a conversation, while possible, was hampered due to the music.  our server was very nice and let three of us who arrived before happy hour ended at 7 to put a last minute drink order in for us; attentive and patient while waiting on six women.  plus, she was very nice to run 5 different credit cards to pay the bill.  the menu was diverse and included small plates, entrees, and pizza. everyone at the table tried a pizza and the consensus was that they were all very good.  i tried the bruschetta pizza and it was delicious, and i'm not even a huge gourmet pizza fan. my husband ate my leftovers for dinner on friday night, and he said it was delicious as well and it heated up nicely (you never know with leftovers how they will taste the next day!). i thought some of the prices of the small plates were a tad high, but not sure the size of them.    i'm taking one star off because i didn't find the happy hour price of my wine very much of a deal.  $7.50 for a glass of riesling at happy hour? maybe i'm spoiled by caffe boa's happy hour, but i don't find $7.50 much of a happy hour deal (the glass normally was $9.50). maybe $2 off during happy hour is a deal at a place like javino's, but i've seen better happy hour specials other places.</u_review>
<b_review>this is just another huge outdoor mall that could be mistaken for desert ridge or west gate.  expect quick service food and a few nice dining options with several chain stores.  they have the splash pad for kids and a great fireplace and outdoor seating to so its a great meeting place for families.</b_review>
<b_review>i come to tmpquite often usually to run in and out at high speed to a few of my favorite places like cost plus world market, pier 1, or just needing to go to tcf bank, or a froyo fix, all conveniently located on one end and all during my lunch hour. (plus driving through is a bit chaotic and confusing due to the set up)  it wasn't until last night that i realized how awesome this place really is. after grabbing a quick bite to eat, then a coffee, seeing a movie, then strolling down to my favorite yogurt shop mojo i'd not noticed how many stores, places to eat and even how beautiful a place to hang out tmp is. perhaps i was caught up enjoying a relaxed evening and that now it is decorated for the holidays(of which i'm hoping some of the lights remain) with the outdoor fireplace going an fountains flowing it was an enjoyable atmosphere. since i have little time or desire to shop, it just hadn't occured to me that tmp offers so much more. as we enjoyed our ice cream outdoors and had strolled around, i noticed people hanging out playing cards, sipping coffee in cushioned chairs, sitting by the fountains and the fireplace, no hurried holiday hustle to grab some random gift of which with many stores there are plenty but all just enjoying a fun place to hang out. i then remembered that  tmp  on occasion has outdoor concerts and during the summer i have taken my princess and her cousin to the splash pad to play( brillaintly located in front of mojo)  tempe marketplace is more than just your one stop shop, it's a cool place to be!</b_review>
<b_review>this is a really cool place to visit, especially if you're visiting from out of town (or state in my case). i initially thought this was just another typical shopping area, but i was quite amazed at its size, restaurant selection, and store variety.   what i liked most about this place is how there was outdoor seating. i'm not talking just about tables and chairs, but there were sofas under large umbrellas. the area by the movie theater even had a cool fireplace looking thing. a lot of the natives recommended this place, and i can see why.   i would recommend this place as well since it has a lot more going on than one would expect.</b_review>
<b_review>ok, i've read some of the reviews here and i honestly can't disagree more.  sure, it's a big, outdoor strip mall.  yes, there are nothing but chains here but honestly, practically everyone i know shops at target, barnes and noble, or any one of the other hundred retailers that are here.  if you want a mom and pop store, this is not the place to find it.  that being said, tempe marketplace is what it is.....take it or leave it.    in california these types of places are fairly commonplace.  i see them here but on a much smaller level than tempe marketplace.  the real drawback here is that it is an outdoor mall so who is going to go there in the middle of the day during the summer when it's 115 outside? not me!!  but the rest of the year, when it's nice....yes, i can see myself meandering around, browsing the stores, having a bite to eat and going to the movies.  i've been here once on a late sunday afternoon.....lots of folks were eating at the restaurants and going to the movies.  still more were just walking around window shopping since most of the stores close between 5 and 7 on sunday.    i liked the tempe marketplace so sue me.  the only drawback to me is that it's outdoors and there is no garage parking for when it does get ungodly hot.  i'm sure you could fry an egg in the parking lot in the summer.  i like mine scrambled though.</b_review>

<text>i've ate at osf twice now and it was two times too many. both times service has been horrible. i get that working the lunch shift may not be lucrative, but yesterday i was with a group of approximately 15 and our waiter was incredibly rude and disinterested in serving us. he was banking on the fact that he would get an automatic 18% from each of us, which is unfortunate because for good service i will tip more. beyond the lousy service, the food is not good. i had the fettucini alfredo the first time i ate at osf and it was drowning in alfredo sauce...yuck. the salad looks like something you get from a bag. yesterday i ordered a caesar salad as my entree. first, it had tomatoes in it. i really don't like tomatoes in caesar salad. second, our waiter brought it out with the other salads. so that meant that when my group got their entrees, i had nothing and basically had to watch them eat. since when were entree salads brought out with starter salads??? lastly the wine selection is pathetic. there are only two white wines by the glass and the riesling i had yesterday was much too sweet.   for generic italian food, go to the olive garden. at least their salad and breadsticks are decent.</text>
<u_review>my husband and i went to wildfish last night to celebrate his birthday. the decor is nice and i thought the white jackets the wait staff wore were a nice touch. the hostess stand is in a very weird little spot off to the side when you walk in and there is really no good place to stand while you are waiting for your table.  our waitress was very nice and helpful, but the wait between everything (ordering drinks to getting drinks; ordering app to getting app; etc) was really long. i wouldn't recommend going on a completely empty stomach and starving.  on to the food...we had the crabcake appetizer to start. i've had better crabcakes i've bought in the frozen food section of the grocery store. the amount of lump crabmeat was seriously lacking and the flavors were off. i did appreciate the minimal use of filling. i had the jumbo scallop dinner. i loved it. the scallops were perfectly cooked and the sauce really complimented the scallops well.  my husband had no problem finishing what i couldn't!  he had the lemon sole...needless to say he ate more of my scallop dinner than his. you couldn't taste lemon or sole...all you could taste was the parmesan breading.  we had a half order of the truffled mac and cheese as a side and it was good. a half order was the perfect size for the two of us.  for a $100+ dinner, i didn't walk away loving wildfish. it was ok and we'll go back because of the scallops, but not until we have a gift card or my in-laws come to visit and are paying.</u_review>
<u_review>i met some friends last night at cadillac ranch and this was my first time going. the space has a very odd layout, but there are two bars (one inside and one outside on the patio) and both have plenty of tvs to watch. there is also a very cliche mechanical bull, but unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) no one rode it while i was there.  service at the bar was really good, but when our group moved to a table, service became spotty. we had two servers for our table of 11 and one would take a drink order or would be asked for something and then not deliver it or something would get missed...the two servers just didn't coordinate very well. luckily we weren't in a hurry and were a pretty laid back group. i only ate the cadillac salad (mixed greens, tomatoes, cheese and croutons) and it was a nice size for $7.95. however, and maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine, but i hate when restaurants put the dressing on for you! i prefer for it to come on the side, as it does in almost every single restaurant i have ever been to, so i can put on as much as i would like. i did try a few of my friend's fries and they were good...not oily and for fries, they were actually pretty light. as a note, for groups, they put an automatic 20% gratuity on the bill, not the standard 18% most other places do.  overall, i wouldn't recommend this place as a lunch or dinner destination as i was not impressed by the menu or the entree prices which seemed on the high side for what they were. however the three stars i am giving cadillac ranch are for their happy hour:  $2 domestics $3 imports $3 fat tire bottles $3 flavored smirnoff vodka drinks $3 margaritas $4 rum (captain morgan) $5 vodka martinis $3.50 to $5ish select appetizers (there are about four or five)  i'm always happy when i can get stella drafts for cheap. also, according to the bartender, one of the margaritas they serve can only be purchased a maximum of 4 times by one person because it is so strong. one piece of advice: if you start at the bar and move to a table, close your tab at the bar even if they offer to transfer it to your table. we had a huge mess last night and some people overpaid and some of us underpaid.</u_review>
<u_review>i really really wanted to like luminarias the desert botanical gardens. i thought it was going to get me in the holiday spirit. unfortunately, that didn't completely happen. what i imagined it was going to be like was definitely not what i encountered.    you couldn't see any of the plants because they weren't lit up.  the luminarias only gave off enough light so that you could make out the outline of trees and plants.  also, only like four or five trees had lights on them and none of the cacti or other plants had lights on them. the only lights were the luminarias that lined the pathways. boo.  also, there was live music...i was expecting holiday music. you know, "walking in a winter wonderland" and stuff like that. oh no, that wasn't the case. instead, there was "just the way you look tonight". we looked at each other and wondered if we were at a wedding.  overall, it was definitely not worth the $25 admission fee for the luminarias event. there was really nothing special about the event that made it seem worth that price. plus, if you wanted any drinks (beer, wine, cider, etc), you had to pay for it at normal bar-type prices. for $25, i would have expected free hot chocolate and cookies at the bare minimum.</u_review>
<u_review>my husband and i frequent sports bars since we are both sports nuts and sometimes watching a game at home by ourselves is a little dull. saturday afternoon we were starting to go a bit stir crazy at home, so we decided to check out upper deck sports grill to watch the jag/pats playoff game.   the only reason i am not giving this place one star is that there were tons of tvs with a variety of sporting events playing and i liked the two level idea. we sat on the second level at this mini bar that lines the balcony so we would have a great view of the two huge projection screens that were showing the football game.  other than that, i have nothing positive to say about upper deck.  the service was horrific...my husband actually had to go to the bar on the second level to get our drinks and order our food because while there were waitresses walking around, they never came over to us.  the food was incredibly mediocre...i ordered the "kickin chicken wrap"...i am still trying to figure out what was kicking about it.  my husband got the chicken burrito and he didn't care for it.  the menu is really lackluster and not much about it envokes the sports bar idea.  the beer prices were a tad high for the most part, but our 64 oz. bud lite pitchers were $8.50 which we didn't think was too bad.  one of the most odd things about upper deck is the hodge podge assortment of universities or teams that claim the bar as their "viewing" place for games...georgia tech, kansas, virginia tech, michigan state, and the philadelphia eagles all had banners hanging up...weird.  what the common bond between them all is, i have no clue.  needless to say, i will not be making a trip back to upper deck anytime in the future.</u_review>
<b_review>the old spaghetti factory is a fun chain restaurant where both families and larger, alcohol-fueled gatherings are at home.  i come from an area where "red italian" menu items are commonplace, and mediocrity is the norm.  from this perspective, the cooking here is comforting and old-school; a notch above the ordinary, but nothing to get excited about.  fortunately, portions are very generous, prices are quite reasonable and the old spaghetti factory scores on that basis.  the lasagna was loaded with meat and just enough ricotta to balance.  not enough mozzarella was buried under a thick coat of ho-hum tomato sauce.  several other cheeses were (literally) throw-in's, the dish would improve with their removal or replacement with adequate quantities of garlic, basil, oregeno and/or onion.  seasoning, in general, appears to be oriented toward their pre-school and geriatric patrons.  my coworker had the crab raviolli; it looked delicious, but a bit light on crab.  she did enjoy it.  while david was a capable and friendly waiter, the kitchen let him (and us) down.  our appetizers and entrees were brought to the table within a minute of each other; completely unacceptable, and cause for the loss of one star.</b_review>
<b_review>i think calamari f. pretty much summed it up. osf serves absolutely inedible "italian" food that is far worse than the usual americanized italian fare you get at chain italian restaurants like olive garden. i would have rather had seafood alfredo from red lobster. the prices were also very high. the only good thing about our experience was the "free" spumoni ice cream that comes with every entree purchase. avoid at all costs.</b_review>
<b_review>i don't know why i like this place!  the food is average- not craveable. the service is consistently bad. i'm sorry, but i have encountered so many clueless employees at this place that are too pathetic to even complain about.   that aside, i like the way this place feels. it's fun to take my younger family members from out of town.  what kid wouldn't want to eat lunch in an old-time train car? plus, ice cream is free with a dinner- can't beat that! don't expect your waiter to be a wine expert- or even know what a mimosa is during sunday brunch- but, it is a cute little place with lots of fun memorabilia.  like i said, the food is not going to knock your socks off, but it's not that bad- just forgettable.  stick to the basics that are hard to mess up, like lasagna, and enjoy that free ice cream (i suggest the spumoni).</b_review>
<b_review>i can't say i will be going here very often but it is another option for me when i want a nice dinner that is gluten free.    i was impressed that we mentioned gluten free and the waiter gave me some options, he even remembered no croutons on my salad and the item i ordered had a gluten item on it so they substituted something else in it's place.    the food was good and i have to say the pasta was really good because i've made my own and well this was a lot better.  it was the perfect consistency i just wasn't impressed with one of the toppings because it made the dish very dry.  i ordered the pot pourri forgetting that the clam sauce would have gluten in it and substituted with the browned butter and mizithra cheese which was really dry to me.  the marinara sauce was good and added some flavor to the dish which i thought it was missing with the other item.    this is a great family restaurant and the staff is really nice and friendly.  for the price of the food and the service you really can't beat it.</b_review>

<text>attended two conferences here and have been amazed by the property's facilities, food, and service.  the staff here is top notch and goes over the top to make you feel at home and special.  i asked about the sculpture on the golf course and they brought me a pamphlet explaining the origin of the sculpture, the artist, and the property.  the food we were served for lunch & dinner at the conference was amazing too......filet & mashed potatoes for dinner and cold cut sandwiches for lunch.  the food was quality and fresh.  the servers knew how to deliver and pick up the dishes without making too much noise as to distract us from the keynote speakers......you don't find that skill too often anymore.  overall, it's a great place to organize/attend a meeting.  plan to return for a vacation.  return factor - 100%</text>
<u_review>for my 1700th review, i'm writing about razz's.  thanks to groupon, we've been able to enjoy razz's restaurant twice.  located in an older shopping center on shea & scottsdale rd, i recommend that you make advanced reservations and that you request a table away from the windows if it's during the hot months.  the reason is because the tables near the windows are very hot and the ac here is inadequate because it's an older building with inefficient insulation.  now, on to the food and drink....during our 2 visits, we ordered:  parmesan encrusted pork tenderloin, $25.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=_jhswz6qexzzb0aa1enfva#_jhswz6qexzzb0aa1enfva  peppered new york strip, $32.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=obcmb5p-hvyyty1cnumv1a#obcmb5p-hvyyty1cnumv1a  mixed greens salad, $10.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=dc5zaksqqz9elhvngs2ilg#dc5zaksqqz9elhvngs2ilg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=rpw_hwkpuz5bu4frw6klig#rpw_hwkpuz5bu4frw6klig  pietra santa merlot, $48 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=hls4h8s8ve_f0f-v8ksaqa#hls4h8s8ve_f0f-v8ksaqa  hahn meritage, $60  crespelles, $14.95  grilled rack of lamb chops, $38.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=w1f-8cjo9etfxhqtca_9pw#w1f-8cjo9etfxhqtca_9pw  pan roasted duck breast, $26.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=1hjtb9obc8qtmtnrzwfz3a#1hjtb9obc8qtmtnrzwfz3a  praline hazelnut torte, $8 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=6on1ca-kp7f01tl304s9zq#6on1ca-kp7f01tl304s9zq  triple chocolate torte. $8 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=72impft4nm8yaheerixdla#72impft4nm8yaheerixdla  where do i begin?  hmmm...well, the mixed green salad is awesome. they have a house dressing that's to die for and goes well with the fresh vegetables.  a perfect way to start a meal.  i ordered on both visits, it's that good.  the peppered ny strip steak was nothing to write home about....very average.  however, the parmesan encrusted pork tenderloin is a-w-e-s-o-m-e!  it has a perfect combination of sweet and meaty flavor to it....well done razz, well done!  the pan roasted duck breast and grilled rack of lamb chops are also fantastic!  we enjoyed 3 out of the 4 entrees we had over the 2 dinners....great job team razz!  for dessert we had the praline hazelnut torte and the triple chocolate torte.  both were very good.  the wine we had on both nights was spectacular and went well with our dinner.  they offer a decent selection of wine.  the restaurant also doubles as an art gallery, so you can find paintings on the walls for sale....if that's your gig. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=wohdkk0r4mip-gdlue_z2g#wohdkk0r4mip-gdlue_z2g  we didn't realize that the kitchen was actually right in front of the bar seats, so the bar seats are premium seats because you can watch razz and the team cook...razz will also come up and greet you if you're sitting at the bar.  however, since we didn't book reservations in advance, those seats were taken on both nights we visited.  if we come back, we'll try to book a couple of seats at the bar.  return factor - 90%</u_review>

<b_review>for large group events, this place is pretty nice. great pools, decent food, nice bars, golf, and convenient shopping nearby. rooms are spacious and well furnished.   tip: don't come in the summer. there's only so much golf and pool you can do in 105 degree weather</b_review>
<b_review>for the second year in a row the boyfriend and i have enjoyed a summer staycation at the westin kierland resort. even though it's only about 30 minutes from our house in tempe the westin kierland makes us feel like we are away on vacation.  the resort is very large with lots of comfortable places to relax, dine or explore. the have two large pools, one is for families and includes a lazy river and the other is an adult only pool, which is what we opted for. the pool area is really pretty and kept very clean. there are a ton of chairs so you don't have to worry about getting out there early to get a seat. there are also a lot of umbrellas so you can find shade even on the sunniest of summer days. they also have a pool waiter walking around making sure you have plenty of ice water or you can order drinks and food. i love being waited on at the pool!  the rooms are pretty large with their heavenly bed. they are on par with the other westin's i have stayed at.  right next door is an outdoor shopping center that has a lot of really great places to eat as well so you'll never be at a loss for things to do or eat.  i would recommend the westin kierland to anyone from out of town or   to anyone in town who wants an easy weekend escape.</b_review>
<b_review>great staff, good food, nice grounds. love the lazy river, easy parking and the bar. food truck fridays were great as well. this may be one of my favorite vacation properities.</b_review>
<b_review>they do a breakfast buffet all week 6am-11am  it used to be 17 but is now 25 a person it includes access to the buffet and oj, coffee, tazo teas.  i called ahead to see if they used partialy hydrogenated oils, they dont!!  they voulenteered to call the vender they use for the bagels and called me back with the ingredients, once again it too did not have the oil.  they serve bagels, bagel spreads of lox, butter, cream cheese, very thinnly slice purple onion, capers, thin tomato slices, other stuf.  they make about 5 diffferent pasteries from scratch, different muffins, cheese danish, croisount, other stuff.  omlets with any thing you can think of, waffles, french toast, pancakes, steel cut oatmeal, home fries, fresh berries and whipped cream, bacon , and sausage, and they will make you juevos rancheros and other egg specialties.   it is absolutley the best i go all the time</b_review>

<text>jade palace on pinnacle peak in north scottsdale was my "go-to" chinese place for years... so when i moved to old town, i felt a bit lost and haven't been able to find consistent chinese nearby ever since.  i've recently found a few options in phoenix, but after a recent take-out experience with friends and last night's meal dining in at this jp location, i think i may become a regular!  we met my parents for dinner here, and everyone was pleased with the meal.  service was spot-on, atmosphere was fine, drinks were cold and refilled often (the beers even came with chilled glasses), and most important, the food was fabulous!  i took charge of the food order for our party of four but allowed everyone to chime in of course.  here's what we had:  appetizers:  *1 large order new york egg rolls (2 total egg rolls but we had them cut in half so each of us had a half... delicious!) *1 large order bbq spare ribs (8 per order)  entrees: *lo mein noodles with shrimp and (extra) broccoli *dry sauteed string beans (1 small order) *house specialty #9 (kung pao three delicacies) - sea scallops, jumbo prawns, and sliced flank steak in kung pao sauce *mu shu chicken   of course, this was all served with plenty of white rice as well.  we ate almost everything, and the only negative i can say is that unfortunately, we didn't have leftovers to take home!    another perk for this location? sweet republic is in the same shopping center, so if you save room, head over there for dessert!</text>
<u_review>can you say "food coma?"  omg... i think perhaps i am in a food coma as i type this review... not sure what more i can add that the other 75 reviews haven't covered, but i'll give it a shot!  we went to lo-lo's today after the phoenix 10k.  there was a group of 7 of us total and we arrived around 10:30am.  we were told there would be a 30 minute wait (which was pretty accurate).  some of us went in and filled up drink cups with kool aid, lemonade, iced tea or a combination - the sugar totally held us over!  we studied the menu as we waited so we all knew what we were going to order before we sat down.  rasheeta was our waitress and she was awesome - there were a few other guys helping her out as well.  i had the "nay nay's" which came with 2 waffles, 2 eggs (i ordered them over easy), and grits.  oh, and i ordered a side of fried okra as well.  (i figured i may as well go all out 'cause who knows when i'll be back).  the waffles and grits had enough butter on them to feed an army of hungry runners.  i also had a bite of jared's fried chicken.  everything was delicious...  so much for all of the calories burned during the 10k.  thanks lo-lo's for my fix of southern food - it reminded me of the good ol' days i spent in atlanta!    i'm sure i'm missing some highlights from our meal, but since i was there with a table full of yelpers, hopefully they will fill-in what i missed!</u_review>
<u_review>i have to agree with patti b. that this location pretty much sucks.  the service is just ok - they are far from friendly.  i've been in  a couple of times to pick up food and i have yet to be impressed.  i wanted to give them another chance tonight and i should not have bothered.  the food is not so good.  i'd rather go to pita jungle or thai llana any day!  the spring rolls are greasy and room temperature and the tofu is pretty nasty.  i had some kind of udon noodle dish and threw most of it in the garbage.  use your 'free entree' coupon to save $$ one night, but that's about it... i will not be returning to (this) pei wei any time soon...</u_review>
<u_review>i just came home from watching my brother compete in his third ironman.  i have to toot his horn and mention that he finished in 11 hours and 29 minutes, his best time yet.  go z!  ironman az is insane.  for those that don't know.  the ironman triathlon consists of a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike, and 26.2 mile run.  yes - all in one day!  it's inspiring to watch these incredible athletes.  the city of tempe and ford, the main sponsor, do a fantastic job making this a spectator friendly event as well.  i'm not sure i'll ever compete in a full ironman, but perhaps a half. (i've done a quarter distance before as well as olympic and sprint triathlons).  but as long as my brother continues to compete in the full distance, i'll be out there cheering for him and being an extremely proud sister.  congrats again to all of you that competed today!</u_review>
<u_review>i guess i should've looked at brian s's review before i dropped off my clothing at prestige.  or, maybe i should've listened to my boyfriend when he told me to ask at prestige how much each item would be for dry cleaning.  of course, i didn't... and for that i was punished when i received the bill.  $16 to dry clean a banana republic dress that probably cost me $50 to purchase.  that's ridiculous!  ready for more insanity? 1 shirt/blouse - $14.10 (it had beads on it but still!) 1 dress (another sundress) - $18.40 1 pair of capri pants - $9.10 1cotton blouse - $8.10  total damage - $65.70  yes, i am extremely embarrassed that i wasted so much $$ on dry cleaning that i could've had done at the $1.99 cleaners instead!  i would have saved $55.70!  that is a lot of money!  needless to say, i will not be back to prestige unless i go to pick up jared's shirts there.  i guess that's the only decently priced item.  he gets them laundered for $2.25 a pop.  good luck to you and your high prices, prestige cleaners!</u_review>
<b_review>**************hai, (yes, it's true). five stars****************  this is the place for traditional chinese...........you'll love the menu. the dishes  ..........are not lacking in sauce.  each dishes sauce......is distinct from other entrees sauces. portion size is very good. everything tasted fresh.  the wait staff........is top notch.  unlike george & sons the hot tea is free also, brown rice is free at george .........you'll pay $2 for each.</b_review>
<b_review>i ordered shrimp with lobster sauce as a takeout order.  they claim they make it ny style.  they did.  the taste was good but a little on the salty side.  i found the portion a little small for $13.50 plus tax.  i could not share it with anyone not because i was greedy but because it was not enough.  they did give me brown rice without an up charge though.  they need to figure out how to give their clients more for the money.</b_review>
<b_review>this place is amazing.  nicest chinese restaurant i've been in a while.  i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper.  it's modern and asian.    went there with 2 friends and the food was great and the service was superb.  my friend loved it so much that she is going to bring her mom on her next visit.  the stir fry shrimp dish was wonderful with large shrimps.  the green bean was so delicious that i want to add it to my next thanksgiving dinner.  i had a bit of trouble with the bones on the roast duck, but it was finger licking good.  the only miss for us that night was the pot sticker because we didn't like the thick wrapping though the fillings were quite tasty.  i agreed with nicole that most of the clientele are on the older side, but with the great food, service and reasonable pricing, i could care less how old the people at next table are.</b_review>
<b_review>i was born and raised in the phoenix area and i always laugh when people make comments about the "quality of chinese food" here. are you kidding? at this moment there are more people of chinese descent in the san francisco airport than in the entire state of arizona. you aren't going to find the same food here as you will find in places like san francisco and vancouver. it's simply not going to happen.   but, if you've got a taste for americanized chinese food, this is a good choice.  i'm confused by the ageism demonstrated in some of these reviews.  i haven't noticed that a lot of old people eat here, probably because i don't care.  heck, i'd rather be surrounded by people my parent's age than a restaurant full of young children with noodles hanging out of their mouth.  i've always had consistently good service and good food at this restaurant.  i'm certain you can find better chinese food in san francisco, but jade palace is much closer.</b_review>

<text>how can i politely say that all this place has is "chick food."   i have been here several times, and tried their limited vegetarian options. i found that the one with the mos flavor was the grilled feta. the feta gave it a nice flavor however the basil was lacking as were the tomatoes. it was original to use a fresh cheese like feta for a grilled cheese.  the meal includes chips and a side. i usually go for th pasta salad as it is the most filling. the flavor of the salad is bland and i usually empty half of a pepper shaker into it.   i have tried to spice up my food with the italian dressing that is found on each table. i found it best to turn the bottle upside down and let the oil separate out, this way you can get just spices and vinegar, it goes well on the chips.   overall the meals here are a bit pricey for the lack of flavor and portions.</text>
<u_review>i can hardly tell my paneer's from my gobi's but i can tell you that i like this place.  walk in and you will find a modern contempray dinning room with granite top tables, booths and tables. in back is the buffet setup.  we were in for lunch at 12:30 on a saturday and the buffet was the only option, and what a good option it was. so many flavorful dishes and all veg!  i tried them all then tried many a second and third time.  we were offered dosas, a indian crepe like item. i don't know if this cost us extra but it was good and with dosa's the buffet was $12.  the dishes had pretty good flavor, some flavors did not pop as much as i would have liked but overall the selection and quality won me over. the buffet is nice as i am still mostly lost on what to order when looking at an indian food menu.   we had water with our meal, they give you glasses and a carafe of water but oddly no ice.  if you are veg go here and just keep eating, if you are not, you may not even notice that the place is meat free.</u_review>
<u_review>i visit la canasa several times a week, a week mainly due to their proximity to my office. luckily their food is pretty decent as are their prices.  if you are going here for lunch you may want to avoid arriving right at 12pm as the line out the door can be quite long. for lunch you order at the counter, and take a number to your seat, and they bring you your food. tipping seems to be optional in format of dining.   another unique aspect is their chips and salsa bar. it contains the usual corn tortilla chips and the delectable flour tortilla chips. if you have never had flour tortilla chips you are in for a surprise.  the menu consists of the usual mexican fast foods, burritos of all types, tacos, enchiladas and plates. there are also soups and some authentic items for the brave. for lunch you may want to look at the a la carte menu and save a few dollars unless you are huge fan of rice and beans. another money saving tip is to forgo the drink as their soft drinks cost upwards of $2  i often order the chillie relleno burrito. it is a item i try everywhere as it has many different recipes. here the burrito has the obligatory chillie filled with cheese covered in a very eggy egg batter and a hot red salsa mix heavy on the peppers. if you like your food "enchilada style" you can order it this way for an extra charge or simple walk over to the salsa bar and smother your burrito with salsa.</u_review>
<u_review>where did my burros go? gone is the grilled fish burrito as is the bean burrito, leaving me with nothing but a grilled veggie burrito option.   one of the nice things is the  chips given after ordering, giving one something to snack  on before your food is ready.  also new is a "seasonal salsa"  this month it was cranberry salsa, it was different and not bad.  it can get a bit busy here but they seem to have a good handle on the rush. my one issue is you can not see the menu board from where the line is. this must slow down some people as it slowed me down.  if you love salsa and work near by or have a 2 for 1 coupon like we did give it a whirl.   if a shaking floor bothers you get a to go order, i was surprised how much our seats shook as the train passed by.  ** quick update all of that great salsa was only on loan. 4 hrs late it was all gone tanks to some food bourne illness.***</u_review>
<u_review>go west for fun adventure and good values. west of the i17 that is.  with some convincing i got a few of my co workers to try this place. from my office at 18th ave there are 12 mexican food places before we reach this lone asian buffet.  walk in and you pay $6.50 plus tax for all you can eat and drink soft drinks.   grab a plate and marvel at the eclectic mix of foods, many chinese favorites, some buffet usuals like the wide mix of fried foods and random jello deserts, and then discover the most out of place and best thing, garlic bread.   for veggie they had bean sprouts, lo mein with veggies, a veggie fried rice, fried bananas, butter potatoes, french fries and fresh doughnuts.  they also had a good amount of fish, some type of skin on roasted fish in a butter sauce, a fried fish and fried whole tilapia.  i was very happy to see a wide range of hot sauces to put on the food including siraca at the tables, chillie oil and chillie paste.  the booth are very 1986 looking and are well sunken in.  overall the value and quality here is good and none of us got sick afterwards so it passes that key test.. their last few heath ratings have been all silver, so give it a try!</u_review>
<b_review>my food was good but my gf ordered an egg salad sandwich w pasta salad and was delivered a tuna salad sandwich with fresh fruit. when they fixed the mistake, there was eggshell in her sandwich. no bueno.</b_review>
<b_review>it's all about the chicken salad...  i know that those people that reviewed zoe's before me were not the biggest fans.  however, i think that zoe's is a perfect place to go if you are looking for a healthy casual lunch.  everything is made fresh daily, and it's pretty quick if you want it to be.  i go in phases with ordering different items.  my first few times at zoe's, i had the 'protein power plate.'  for $7.45, this is a great option - especially if you're into the low carb diet!  it consists of grilled boneless skinless chicken breast served with grilled onions over a plateful of zoe's special slaw.  pretty tasty - if you like feta cheese.  don't make the mistake that my friend allyson b. made and order this if you are not a feta fan :)  my next phase was with the greek salad and grilled chicken... they give you a big portion, so it's very filling and zoe's special dressing tops it off.  there is one surprise with this one though - hiding underneath the salad is zoe's special potato salad - assuming you like potato salad, you'll enjoy the surprise when you take a bite.  if not, you may need your napkin after that bite!  after the greek salad phase, i took advantage of zoe's 'dinners for four.'  i highly recommend the chicken kabob dinner.  my boyfriend and brother did too!  for $26.95, this was a great deal - it fed the three of us and we had leftovers.  it came with eight chicken kabobs, a huge container of rice pilaf, greek salad, and pita bread.  great for a night that you don't want to cook!  (they also have baked chicken and greek chicken marinara dinners for four available).  ... and my latest phase is the chicken salad and fruit plate.  i am addicted!  it is a light, yummy, healthy, fresh lunch and leaves me feeling just satisfied enough that i haven't had the urge to order 'yaya's homemade chocolate sheet cake' for dessert.    so, four stars for zoe's kitchen... i've experienced friendly service and great food at both locations.  if you do go to zoe's and try the chocolate cake before i do, please let me know if it's as good as it looks?!</b_review>
<b_review>soooo, i stopped in to zoe's on a whim this afternoon. my ravished pregnant self was excited to see a grilled cheese with tomato sandwich on the the menu. one that also comes with chip and a side dish (i opted for the fruit salad.) for a reasonable $6.95. the limeade also looked yummy, so i got that, too. while i did have to drive about 20 minutes back to my office, i still believe that this meal would have stunk even if i sat down and ate it on the spot. the bread was burnt, the cheese was american - blech! (even though i see now, i get a choice of cheese instead of all the cheese listed, i wasn't asked.), and the fruit salad was all green apples. excuse me, one piece of pineapple. the only thing that saves this place from one star is the limeade. and even that could have been less sweet. skip this place. it isn't healthier for you, it's not local and it under delivered. :(</b_review>
<b_review>i went here once to check it out. unfortunately, i probably won't be going back. i'm all for healthy food and would like more options when it comes to area restaurants but for me, zoe's didn't cut it. looking over the menu i decided upon the chicken pita. the food came quick enough, i think there was only one other patron in the place at the time. anyways, the chicken was bland and flavorless. hello, taste? where are you? the pita bread was just as bad, it fell apart within moments. the only saving grace was the caramelized onions. a nice touch although not enough to save this meal. the pita came with a side of your choice (i opted for the pasta salad, pretty disappointing) and a bag of potato chips. whatever. i thought this was supposed to be healthy eating? the decor reminded me of a fast food place in europe: very colorful and bright. perhaps one day in the future i may try zoe's again, but for now two stars seems more than appropriate.</b_review>

<text>okay - i've been going here fairly regularly and i've upgraded this to a 5 star place. the food is awesome and the people here are rad. it's one of my new favorites. i don't know what i was thinking giving it a 4. i'm stupid.  this place ranges from quite busy to comfortably laid back as it turns out. it's always an easy place to go though.   as for the pronunciation, i used to say it like "frasier's" instead of like it's spelled and then for some reason started saying it like it's spelled for the last few months. tonight i asked the owner and he confirmed it was pronounced like frasier's. i feel stupid yet again, but at least i've been sending people there.</text>
<u_review>i wrote a review of this place back in mid-september and gave it only 3 stars... what the fuck was i thinking?   the food here is fucking brilliant... especially for a chain. amazing burgers. their diablo chicken pasta dish is to die for. the cornbread is actually good - i fucking hate cornbread and yet i'll scarf this shit down like it's crack. their chips and salsas aren't that great - they'll do the job, but i'm still not convinced about them. i'm also unimpressed with the sides that come with the mains, but i don't come to this place to eat the sides.   as i've said before, their margaritas are awesome. they'll fuck you up though, so make sure you have a ride home or else go see a movie to sober up.   the atmosphere is low-end upscale and pretty nice and cozy - kinda dark inside and a bit generic, but generic is better than flashy, ugly and distracting. service is upscale as well and i'm usually pretty pleased with it. they offer free valet parking for customers too which is perfect now that they charge an arm and a leg for the parking structure.  here's my old review for reference:   great margaritas to be had here... really strong and tasty. this location isn't very busy ever it seems... perhaps with fat tuesdays around the corner, it's just too much competition.  it's a good place to grab a strong margarita before heading over to the movies or something. their food doesn't inspire me to eat there, so all i've had are appetizers so far... mainly chips and salsa.  salsa sucks.  it's also got some competition from macayos down the street which doesn't help. i don't know if this place can stay in business much longer unless it gets busier. it could just be the times i was there though.</u_review>
<u_review>while it's not my favorite place, i think this is a good venue. it's the spot of my very first big concert (new order 1989). since then, i've seen some fantastic shows here - beastie boys, circle jerks, violent femmes, rem, etc... i've even been back stage here hanging out with some of the bands.   i have good memories here, so i have no reason to fault it. the parking, the ants, the vendors, the security... i don't remember any of that. i just remember good times... i just remember the music. that's the way it should be. i do remember that they have good sound and the grounds are typically kept fairly nice.   the last time i was there was 5 to 8 years ago, so perhaps things have changed. i imagine it's pretty much the same.</u_review>
<u_review>i'm starting to think that phoenix isn't the mexican food mecca that people seem to think it is. my favorite place closed down over a year ago, and i've since then been on the search for something comparable. i've yet to find anything that comes even close.   taste is very subjective, yet most people get quite defensive about their favorite mexican place. i'm pretty sure this place won't go on the top of many people's lists though. it's not like i thought for even a second that blanco would blow my mind, but i wasn't paying and since it was a fox concept (which is the new way of saying "chain" i guess) i was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.  i tend to order pretty much the same thing when i hit a new mexican joint, and i didn't stray from that this time. i like to get a cheese crisp... i know it's totally not authentic, but my mom used to make them when i was a kid. their version of a cheese crisp was good... even less mexican than most places, but good. interesting type of cheese... fresh and light and not oily.  their salsa was kinda weak, but tasted okay. it needs more flavor and more heat, but it didn't taste bad like some places. i ordered a machaca beef taco dish as well. the beef was boring and flavorless, but quality meat. their margaritas were okay... nothing to write home about, but at least they didn't taste like a store bought mix.   the food was merely okay - at least it was edible. it's not very mexican at all, but it's decent. the things that stands out about this place are that it's very clean and nice inside, and the staff is super friendly and good looking. it's almost to the point that i want to give it 4 stars. if the food wasn't so bland and uninspired, it would be an easy decision. i may change it later. at least i didn't go home with gut rot. i'll eat here again.</u_review>
<u_review>joe's is awesome. it's best as a late night munch after a night of clubbing and drinking and scamming (or whatever you do in that area), but they also deliver during the day. i have eaten at joe's many times late at night, but today we had it delivered and thought i should finally review it. a full fresh pie is a little different from ordering a reheated slice at the counter, right?  the pizza is good for ny style. nice flavors and decent ingredients. you get a lot of pizza for the money... particularly if you pick it up yourself - but 20 bucks delivered for an 18 inch one topping (including tip) isn't bad.   they were pretty nice when i called in my order which can be a bit of a contrast to the experience you get when you show up in person at 2am, but how else would they be expected to handle a line of hungry drunk clubtards going out the door? i was told 30 minutes (which would've been nice), but it took closer to an hour. i've worked pizza delivery when i was a kid and that kind of thing is understandable. no big deal. now, if it happens every time i order from them, i might start to get bummed.  the pizza here isn't quite 5 star to me, but it's close.</u_review>
<b_review>five stars for the ooey gooey butter cake alone. even if everything else at this place sucked (fortunately, it doesn't), that cake would merit 5 stars. i woke up thinking about it this morning!  the toasted ravioli was good and the sauce for dipping had a nice bite. the wine list had some good selections at reasonable prices including rombauer merlot for $40.  didn't even get to try dinner yet... will i need a sixth star?</b_review>
<b_review>ate here last night for the first time. our waitress, chelsea, really knew the menu and gave us some good info for ordering. enjoyed our salads, entrees and especially the butter cake! the coffee was an added bonus - freshly roasted from a place in cave creek. this is a perfect spot to meet friends and enjoy good food and conversation.</b_review>
<b_review>i went here on my birthday with my husband and mother.  i found the booth we sat in to be uncomfortable and needing to be replaced.  i ordered a dirty martini and it was very good!  good price also.  we got the fried raviolis for an appetizer and i think that was my favorite part of the meal.  i ordered a veggie burger (since i am a vegetarian) and it was just so- so.  it was served on bread instead of a bun which bugged me.  they did bring out a complimentary ooey gooey cake for dessert but i didn't try any.  i won't go out of my way to return again.</b_review>
<b_review>took a party of 5 out for dinner. the food was excellent. we had no complaints about the food. the atmosphere was a little less than desirable and the prices were significantly higher than we expected. the area is a little bit of a strip mall area. just some warning but if you are looking for good food this place should be on your list.</b_review>

<text>love love love the bean & cheese burritos! just made a phone order for pick up to try it "with sauce" per most yelpers recommendations... can't wait! fish tacos are good. tacos are street taco size, and they pack a lot of flavor- delish. the place is not special but the food is =)</text>
<u_review>okay, since my latest review, i was contacted by the manager who expressed concern on my bad experience. fran wanted to make sure they had the opportunity to make it right. i was impressed! i do want to say that even if the food sometimes needs a little sumptin sumptin, the customer service is great and always has been! i give them superb credit for that & the ambiance is nice too. we went back for another try & we were satisfied. i definitely think you should stick with the thin or traditional crust, it was better. also a note to update a previous review - they no longer have the portobello steak sticks, not sure why, maybe a cost thing, but they were delicious and i will miss them! another cool note that should be said because it can't be said about most places with an outdoor patio - they do not allow smoking in the patio dining area, which is such a refreshing change. it's nice to be able to enjoy the great arizona weather this time of year. thanks for that!  final words... boombozz is on the top of our list again</u_review>
<u_review>we tried platters... very pleased with both. we especially liked the feta cheese on our salads - it was the most creamy delicious feta cheese i've ever had... they said it was from bulgaria... mmm mmm mmm yummmmmy! lamb was a little overcooked for medium rare, but didn't take away points for that because it was still fabulous. definitely will return for more!  p.s. a little hard to find.</u_review>
<u_review>i have been a member here for a little less than a year. we go about 2-3x a week & love it! we bought the year pass because it was cheaper that way & we wanted to be more committed than the daily or monthly pass. i have been a member at other gyms but not as impressed as i am with the atmosphere here at tumbleweed. it has an indoor track to get out of the az heat. the gym also offers racquetball which is a fun alternative to workout. they offer an array of classes (zumba, yoga, pilates, core conditioning, etc)  which are included in your membership!!!!. you can't find those options for the same rate anywhere else that i know of. the people are professional & friendly - there is no haggling over membership price, commitment, or being approached by personal trainers. on that note, they do not have any personal trainers, which if you are someone who needs motivation or accountability, this probably wouldn't be the place for you. but for the price & option of the daily pass - you could bring a workout buddy anytime!!!  the other side to joining a rec center is that you are supporting your city & giving back to the community - not supporting some big money hungry corporation!   check it out!!!</u_review>
<u_review>hops on tap and great on apps!  we love, love, love the yard house!!! we are beer drinkers, and the beer selection on tap is one of the best in az!! the menu is great & the food is always delicious! awesome happy hour- an extensive menu to tantalize your taste buds!</u_review>
<b_review>i'm an elmer's fanatic. yes, i went to chandler high school, but even though i now live in los angeles., i make it a point to visit elmer's every time i visit phoenix.    my all-time favorite item is the machaca burrito. the best ever!!! it's not like any other machaca burrito i've ever had -- this one does not come with eggs, nor is it dry -- the meat is more the consistency of pot roast, stewed in it's own juices w/ onions, and it is so tender, juicy and bursting with flavor. it does tend to get a bit wet/messy, but the flavor is delicious, especially when you add elmer's sauce.  also good are the bean n cheese w/sauce, the strips, and the lesser known menu item - "butter tortilla w/sauce". it's all about the sauce!  i drown everything in the sauce. (i dream about the sauce).  viva elmers!!!!</b_review>
<b_review>oh elmer's. how i love thee! i have been coming here for years and i will always be a fan. their food is exceptional! pricing isn't too bad either. i can't help but indulge while i'm there so my tab always seems a little high. the strips are phenomenal and the salsa completes the meal. it is the best place for grade a, hole in the wall delicious mexican food!!!</b_review>
<b_review>elmer's taco shop is one of my favorite spots in the east valley area to get mexican food.  it has ample seating both indoors and outdoors and the prices are very affordable with chandler hs across the street (but don't go during the high school lunch hour, the line is out the door.) definitely try the strips  or the cheesy tortilla with beef. amazing!</b_review>
<b_review>best bean and cheese and large strips in the world. been coming here for since 93 and have never eaten anything that wasn't good! period.</b_review>

<text>i brought the family here on a saturday for a nice breakfast and was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful the food was. i had just a basic breakfast of eggs, sausage, and potatoes. all was cooked perfectly and i really enjoyed their potatoes, they were very tasty & reminded me of my own yummy potatoes. i also got a side order of the biscuits & chorizo gravy to split with my son & husband. ooh my ....it was perfect, this is a must try. the chorizo gravy is not on the menu, you have to ask for it. my son had the burger and it came out huge, according to him, it was all that a diner burger should be. the husband had the chorizo scramble w/potatoes and a side of french toast, and again, all yummy.  i really enjoyed the diner atmosphere and noticed while sitting there that there were a lot of regulars, i even noticed that people could bring in their own coffee cup and keep it there...love that kinda place!!   the service was great! we were well taken care of from start to finish. i will definitely be back and suggest you check it out too.  oh...almost forgot. this place is very affordable. for example, the side of biscuits and gravy was $2.99, and my breakfast was $6.99.</text>
<u_review>just started here about 2 weeks ago and have loved it. everyone has been very nice, the place is modern and very clean. i have never had a problem getting on a machine, and i have gone during various times in the day and evening. they provide soap, shampoo, lotion, razors, q-tips, deodorant , and hair dryers.</u_review>
<u_review>went back with some friends to have lunch...had the gyro special for $5.95 (included fries). this was  delicious....service was good this time, but my friends knew most of the employees.</u_review>
<u_review>went here for a company party and was very impressed with the food and the service. my absolute favorite thing i ate was the lamb chops. they were amazing, they had so much flavor and were cooked perfectly. the filet is up there with the best i have ever had.   we were treated like royalty by the staff, but they were down to earth as well. i had a fabulous time here and would recommend this place to everyone!</u_review>
<u_review>great place, especially for happy hour ( 3-7 m-f) and they have a late night happy hour that starts at 10pm , i think. they have beer specials, martinis are $5.95 and almost every appetizer is half off. i have never had a bad meal here. some of the entrees are pricey but the food is good.</u_review>
<b_review>i met m for breakfast on a sunday morning.  the parking lot was full!  i was lucky that someone was backing out, so i did not have to circle the lot or park in on a side street.  m was there already, got a table and ordered me an oj.  =)  the server was nice to give me a few mins to review the menu before she came back.  i ordered the croissant breakfast (two scrambled eggs with cheddar with  sausage on a butter croissant).  and i had to order the french toast too.  i love french toast!!!  the eggs were a little too runny for me but other than that it was good.  the french toast was pretty darn good too.  the service was friendly and quick.</b_review>
<b_review>huge pancakes, crispy and chewy toast, and the breakfast bowl is amazing. i love the atmosphere and the staff are super friendly.</b_review>
<b_review>what can't be faulted: food and coffee are terrific. especially the coffee. also, i have been seated very quickly at each visit. the servers are delightfully cheerful and joe himself comes out to speak to each table directly. it's a high-quality, old-school diner experience and well-worth the minimal price.  what is a bit of an annoyance: by applying all of that personalized service, the speed of the service suffers when they are even a bit busy. i don't believe joe has enough help behind the line, and it's probably further hurt by his zeal for customer interaction. and it seems that maybe order turnaround time might be slowed by the apparent lack of any  computerized order management/pos system. when get your check you're supposed to pay your server, but if she's not around and you go to the front desk (because you need to get on with things), you won't find a dedicated cashier. just a hostess. who is very nice and cheerful.  it could be that this is how long service took back in the day, and i have been spoiled (with the other members in my party) by the super-speedy almost-flawless delivery of cold, corporate places like chili's, denny's, applebee's, and other places who have teams of industrial engineers and mba's to hone their model. in that case i fault myself.  i barely remember how things were back in 1978 or whenever.  i remain a fan and will return, but will need to keep in mind that joe's requires more of a time investment than do other places.</b_review>
<b_review>always busy - which is a good sign!  sometimes means you wait for service, but breakfast is always good.  great pancakes, coffee is locally roasted and decent, and the owners are always around.  good neighborhood diner.  great for kids - they love it here.</b_review>

<text>i have been to this place twice now and although there were some items that i was not a fan of...overall the food and service has been great !  the place is small and cozy and the owners are very involved with every aspect of the restaurant. you can tell that the owners are passionate about what they do and you can tell that care about your business.  yummy items that i have tried and loved are: hummus: even if this was not homemade ( as indicated in a previous post) i do not care ...it was sooo good.  the house soup..can't remember the name??? it is like a greek version of chicken soup. it is light and delicious and i absolutely love it !!  baked ravioli in alfredo sauce: i have had this twice and i will be getting it again and again...it was so gooey and flavorful.  steak and lobster: this was a special on valentines day and both were cooked to perfection and needed nothing added to it whatsoever. this came with steamed veggies and red potatoes...also cooked perfectly.  flaming baklava: this i have had twice also...it is baklava in all it's glory with scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with orange liquer which the light on fire when they bring to your table.  not so yummy : (   grape leaves: these were ok..i have had worse at my big fat greek restaurant...my main complaint with these was there was too much leaf and too much raw garlic.  spanakopita ( spinach pie): this looked delicious and had fresh spinach...but no flavor whatsoever...none  meatballs: again too much raw garlic.  all in all the good stuff that we have had and the great service we have received will keep me coming back to this place</text>
<u_review>applebee's has changed their menu since i have been last and a lot of it looks really yummy!! i had their chicken won ton tacos, you get 4 little tacos for $5.99 and they also have pulled pork. they were sooo good!! this was a take out order, so i can not comment on the service in the restaurant. maybe i will visit them more often.  you can also get delivery for applebee's from you buy and we fly food delivery service!!</u_review>
<u_review>this is still my favorite local place to go have drinks and they still have the same great bartenders after all these years..two of my favorites are bomber and toby. the food is always decent, but i have in recent months been trying to eat more healthy and decided to get their margarita chicken. it was soooo delicious!!! the chicken was marinated in citrus juices and spices, then grilled, put on a bed of rice and black beans, and topped with pico de gallo. highly recommended this dish regardless if you are on a diet or not. they also have very friendly servers here and a great management team!!   you can also order online or by phone for pick-up or you can get delivery from you buy and we fly</u_review>
<u_review>i really do think that i could live off their chicken mole tacos and the salsa bar! the service was wonderful, the food was above and beyond, and i am addicted to their cilantro salsa.   the chicken mole tacos were overflowing with meat and topped with just a bit of pickled onions, perfection. their quesadillas .....as delicious as they are, are not figure friendly. they are homemade corn tortillas stuffed with various meats, cheeses and veggies and then deep fried. i had the oaxaca cheese & char-broiled arrachera steak, which was ooozing out on delivery. waaay more than i bargained for, good thing i was sharing. these are very indulgent and intensely tasty.  once i got a little into trying all their salsas, i decided to mix the cilantro salsa and the chipotle salsa...wow!!  this was my husband's idea, have to give him credit.   if you haven't been here already...go...if you have been here...go back, i know i will.</u_review>
<u_review>had the delicious chorizo biscuits & gravy...still yummy! however....i asked for 2 eggs over easy with my order and did not receive them with my meal. the server apologized and said she would have them right out. a few moments later i receive a small plate with 2 eggs that were already leaking yolk from the underside ....decided to overlook it, but on my first bite i realized the entire underside of the eggs were raw. i just would have hoped that either the cook or the server would have looked at what they were serving me and saw that it was not right. also, the belgian waffle that my husband and daughter shared tasted like a frozen waffle and it was served with the whipped cream and a very very watery bowl of strawberries on the side, not appetizing at all. the breakfast burrito here is very tasty, but not very big, and comes with nothing else for $7...not the best deal on the menu, that's for sure. i will go back for the biscuits & gravy and might try some other menu items that i have heard others talk about. i still consider this a good place and most items are priced low.</u_review>
<b_review>greek night with friends on the westside.  i had the lamb sowlaki which was ok, i've had better.  the portions were a good size however not that tasty.  speaking of tasty, the water tasted funny too. the fried zucchini that we had tasted like it came from the freezer. and the baklava was probably the worst i have had in arizona.  really soggy and the cinnamon was overwhelming.  staff nice yet didn't seem to care to be there and working.</b_review>
<b_review>usually have the gyro meal. it is ok. price is good. haven't tried anything else. the place was usually empty when we went which was nice with kids, but this was at the indian school location. not my favorite greek place on the west valley but it will do in a pinch.</b_review>
<b_review>we went to their old location a year ago. and tried the italian food and kbobs and wasn't impressed. our friends insisted that we go this weekend. so we gave the new location a try and we are just not a fan.</b_review>
<b_review>i was really looking forward to trying this place out but i left disappointed.  ordered pizza and pasta and all anyone could taste was chili pepper.  spaghetti and meat sauce?  chili pepper.  baked pasta and cheese?  chili pepper.  the cheese pizza was cold and bland.  the one positive was the tzatziki dip.  now that was good.  i'd definitely order that again.  the restaurant itself was also pretty warm inside.  and frankly, the food was entirely too expensive for what was served.</b_review>

<text>poo!  i would think after my last review this place would get their s#it together!  we came here for a birthday event in mid-day saturday.  no ball game, no derby, nothing was really going on sports wise...so you would think service would be better.    i want this place to succeed!  it's a great location, the concept is fantastic, man...the service was still horrible.  the waitress at this establishment are ......hmmmmm -trying to think of something nice.  clueless.   the waitresses here are cute, overwhelmed, clueless, can't remember anything.    i would suggest just go to the bar and order everything.  more than likely you'll get what you want, your tab will correct and your food order maybe correct.  still not impressed.</text>
<u_review>came here to meet family for a graduation.  did not actually stay here but had drinks and used their pool.  the staff was exceptional.  they all were so friendly.  the location is not bad, pretty close to the freeway and stores including paradise valley mall right there.  the grounds where very nice and clean.  when i inquired about the rooms and setup my family all loved the amenities, free breakfast, happy hours and clean spacious rooms.  i would definitely recommend this embassy suites to others.</u_review>
<u_review>took friends for their 1st time to the mission, i really wanted to know their opinions on their first visit, as i have been several times.  i really enjoy this place, it's inviting, the hostesses are so friendly and i just love the front patio when they have the fireplace going. they already had drinks from the bar, but i came in a little later and it took quite awhile before i got my first drink. =-( they sat us right away...as i had made reservations via open table, and our server was right there and ready to serve.  the place is always dark with lots of candles and after the sun goes down they will open up the windows.  there is a back patio and it is lit nicely.  too hot to sit out in the summer.  now for the food, we order chips and salsa to start...pretty standard, but when they brought in the extra hot salsa.....there you go.  it was awesome!  way to hot, but if you mix it with the regular salsa, it's good. the guacamole is very, very good.  nice presentation too, as they make it at your table.  we all ordered from the special menu that night and neither one of us were disappointed.  if you ask your server what their favorite is.....they will not point you in the wrong direction.  my server stated the halibut was especially good that night...and that's what i went with.  delicious!!  the only complaint that night was our drinks took awhile, but they made up for it when we raved about the hot hot salsa and she gave me a take home container.  nice touch!</u_review>
<u_review>ok....we came on a saturday afternoon from the scottsdale farmers market.  we drive by rnr after the market each saturday and decided to pop in.  i was excited to see they had a mimosa special that saturday afternoon.  the hostess was very nice asked where we wanted to be seated as the inside was pretty full but it was pretty chilly outside and she could not find us seating for 4 with a heater that was working.  the upstairs was closed but we did see people seating up there.....so we waited.  she was ready to seat us and a foursome decided it was too cold outside and they took our seat inside.  the hostess told us to wait, but we left.    i couldn't wait to take my brother here as he is a chef in the cape cod area and read some of the yelps reviews so i thought this would be a great place to lunch after the farmers market.  anyhow, you don't let customers leave you make it happen especially when you have all of upstairs open.  this place will never know how much we spend here on lunch for 4 or the review it could of been.</u_review>
<u_review>1st time to this festival.  it was okay.  thank goodness yelp sent information regarding 1/2 price admission tickets.  we went on a sunday and some of the restaurants ran out of certain things on their menu.  there was even one beer booth that ran out of beer.  the world of beers for an extra 10.00 was worth it.  the servers were generous.  it would of been nice to have more shaded area...thank goodness today was only high 80's, it was still warm in the sun.  great people watching.  we did try some fanastic tacos and can't wait to hit some new restaurants because of the great tacos.  on a separate note....the whole wedding thing-i didn't get it. i thought what a weird stage event to conduct a wedding.  i'd rather hear a good band playing on the stage.</u_review>
<b_review>(lyrics - chumbabwamba - tubthumping)  i get thirsty so i go to the lion's pub they're always happy to see me around i get thirsty so i go to the lion's pub they're always happy to see me around i get thirsty so i go to the lion's pub they're always happy to see me around i get thirsty so i go to the lion's pub they're always happy to see me around  (yelping the night away, yelping the night away) i try a chicken dish, i try a some nachos i try the flatbread , i try a slider dish i sing the songs they play on the screens that remind me of the good times i sing the songs they play on the screens that remind me of the best times (oh bo bites, bo bites, bo bites)  thirsty lion pub & grill is located on the far west side of tempe marketplace.  it's location is perfect from what i gather away from the movie going crowd and food court area.  standing alone next to kabuki; the restaurants is super spacious with a large patio with a fire pit.  perfect for the cooler nights and not a bad idea for the warmer nights to just enjoy people watching.  no not like that inspector gadget; no stalking allowed!    i like coming to the thirsty lion during the late hours for hh.  they have a great selection of beers and the food is pretty damn good.  i love the nachos here!  extra crispy with avocados, beans, and cheese.  pretty basic, but they pile that stuff on like there's not tomorrow; eat up damn it!  they're bar nachos during hh is pretty awesome too.  they call them pub chips, or potato chips so they're extra thick and you're able to scoop up the bacon, cheese, onions, and tomatoes.  the saltiness and crunch goes well with a cold bitter tasting beer!  yum on a warm night!  i'm not a fan of the flatbread or main entrees so i generally stick with the bar food and burgers, which again is on the hh menu and bar menu.    overall, pretty chill ambience on a game-less night.  they rock out on music videos, that yes, reminds me of the good times and reminds me of the best times! - enjoy!</b_review>
<b_review>the service was impeccable. i'm not sure what they've done to train their hostesses and staff, but we've never been treated better. its always a gamble when you are dining out with children (ages 3 and 10 months) and you run the risk of being stuffed away in a corner, but our server at thirsty lion could not have been more sweet to our kids. she even let our son push the buttons on the computer that placed orders (not sure if its allowed, but we appreciated it.)  flat screens all around allowed us to catch the ncaa march madness - another nice feature.   the food was good. i had a sausage macaroni and cheese which carried a spicy kick. the salads were pretty good sized portions as well.</b_review>
<b_review>have visited the lion a couple of times now, to have a bite after a movie. i like the place. service is good, great selection of beer and drinks, and yummy food. what more can you ask for? the first couple times i ordered a burger ~ they're 1/2 pound burgers! holy cow!  on my last visit, i ordered the chicken penne ~ gorgonzola cream dish. so good; i couldn't stop eating it. some garlic bread would have been a nice addition. great place.</b_review>
<b_review>great pub in the tempe marketplace!  good selection of beer and extensive happy hour menu.  great place to catch a quick drink on your way to the next place or before doing some shopping.</b_review>

<text>this is a great place if money is no object to you! although clean, modern, fresh, and chic, you get what you pay for... a fashionable spot to eat your 4 ounces of frozen yogurt! my wife and i each got a small, hers with a few fruit toppings, mine plain. you then pay by weight, and the two items were over 8 dollars! to me, the place is a total ripoff, no matter how cool or delicious it is. my wife would probably give this joint a 5 star rating, but i can think of ten-thousand better things to spend my money on!</text>
<u_review>went here jan. 2, 2010 for lunch, when college bowl games were on. a veritable plethora of tv's covering all sports to be had, burger was good, and service was just great! good selection of beers, clean, and friendly place. apparently they will be having music on friday & saturday nights. i liked the place!</u_review>
<u_review>i am a fan of all these aliberto's, filiberto's, antonio-berto's, stephanopolis-berto's places. most all are filthy, in lousy locations & neighborhoods, but the food is usually pretty damn good and inexpensive. also, i think they are all 24 hours as well. not only is this location 24 hours, but it's also clean, & in an area where i don't feel like i will be shot at, and the food is really good and very reasonably priced! so glad the concept has moved into the mainstream, and would love to see more scottsdale locations (hint, hint... like in my neighborhood up in n. scottsdale... mr. 'berto)!</u_review>
<u_review>this is a great place to visit, but i wouldn't want to shop there! while its an attraction unto itself, and their inventory is incredible, but there are really no bargains or discounts to be had. i feel the same way about r.e.i. if you are looking for camping gear- they have the stuff, but you can find it for considerably less on e bay, at walmart, etc. in a nutshell, its a fun place to visit, and you'll find a variety of items that you may be looking for, but you're gonna' pay full retail price and you should expect no discount. besides, how do you think they're going to pay their air conditioning bill in the summer months?</u_review>
<u_review>had the thick crust sicilian pepperoni 3/14/2009, took it to the drive in movies, and while it was expensive (23 bucks), it was worth it! this baby could feed 6 people, and it was pretty good as well. i wouldn't get this on a regular basis because of the price and the calories, but i think its the best pizza they have.</u_review>
<b_review>great selection of flavors!  they even have doggie frozen yogurt. score!!!  i have seen many of these serve yourself places that seem pretty lacking in cleanliness and sanitary and yogurtology is definitely clean and well maintained.  butterfinger is my absolute favorite flavor but oatmeal cookie, cake batter, salted caramel and chocolate malt are all very good. this is probably not as good a yogurt shop for fruitier flavors but it has a great variety and some very interesting options for toppings.  only negative is sometimes the wait at the register seems long whether anyone is in front of you or not and the staff aren't always out there for if you want to sample flavors.  i love this place. great hours too.</b_review>
<b_review>i'll admit they have good yogurt--nothing special though. a little worse than yogurtland and but a lot better than cherry on top and orange leaf.   however, their management is the worst. teens who work are unfriendly and, quite frankly, rude. they give you the smallest sample, don't look at you when you ask/ when they hand it to you and are always in your way with the toppings. how about cleaning when there isn't a huge line.   this isn't the real problem though. today, i went in to take advantage of the 35 cent tuesday deal. i go to ring up and it comes to $2.65. i have a $3 credit so i ask if i can fill up more. the girl says ok so i quickly top it off. when i get back, the total is now $7!!! my mom paid and didn't realize the big difference. and why not tell me i can't use my credit on the promotional day when i ask?? shouldn't she tell me i can't use the 3 off on tuesday??  so i asked my mom how much it costs and she tells me $7! i knew it could not be that much so i go back in and ask them to reweigh it. sure enough it was supposed to be $4. they rudely need to "confirm" with the register while we wait in the way of all the other customers. they barely say sorry and try to blame it on the scale or suggest someone had their hand on it. if you're paying by the ounce, i'm pretty sure no one would put their hand on the scale...  at any other place, they wouldn't charge you for the yogurt and you'd probably get it for free. but at this establishment, they are so stingy and rude. i've been a part of a fundraiser with them also and they refused to let me advertise outside. you only get 20% of sales if the customer says they're for the fundraiser. they wouldn't let me tell any of the customers walking in. such bs.  go to any yogurt place. yogurtology is expensive, rude, and stingy with their samples and service.</b_review>
<b_review>this is one of the better self-serve yogurt places in town. their flavors are very inventive and rotate on a regular basis. the yogurt itself tastes better than other places i've tried. seems like the put better ingredients.  their toppings are also a wider selection than other yogurt places i've been too. i like that they had a girl standing next to the machines offering sample cups and suggestions for what to try. its better than going up to the front asking for cups from behind the counter. the area is really nice too with ajs, starbucks and flos in the same shopping center. i didnt really pay attention to price but i didnt find it any more expensive than other yogurt places.</b_review>
<b_review>i can't believe i have been driving to tempe for yogurt. this place works for me. yogurt was very good, it comes out frozen and not too fast. great selection of topping although some were odd and too big. i mean a swiss cake.???  shouldn't that be in pieces?  very clean but it is very busy.</b_review>

<text>trying to find parking here is a nightmare, but the atmosphere is great. this is my favorite location. they have a great patio, great beer and the chicken rolls are so good. i crave them all the time. yum!</text>
<u_review>came here for lunch yesterday and the food was pretty good.   you walk up to the front and put in your order and then go find a table. we came here before noon and it was pretty busy. it actually died down after noon. it takes about 10 minutes or so (maybe more) for your food to come to your table so don't come here if you're in a rush.   some of the orders come with beans and rice and others with just chips. and they bring a green and red salsa to your table. i had a carne asada burrito with chips and it was just enough to fill me up. my boyfriend's enchilada meal came with rice and beans. the horchata was pretty good (i've had the homemade stuff and nothing compares), but not as good as the ones you can get from a betos place.   the guy taking orders said their carnitas and blackened chicken were their specialties so i'll have to try one of those next time i stop by.</u_review>
<u_review>came here after having dinner with friends at a brewery around the corner. i love paletas! i grew up in south phoenix and looked forward to the paletero (guys with the carts and mexican popsicles, i know you've heard them ringing their bells) every afternoon. after moving to the east valley the only thing that came by was the schwann's truck. wah wah. so i was super excited to know my childhood treat was a little closer to home. from what i can remember here are the flavors they have right now: pecan, spicy chocolate, mango, mango with chile, strawberries and cream, pineapple, arroz con leche (milk and rice with a hint of cinnamon, i use to have this for breakfast as a kid). i tried the pecan flavor and there were chunks of pecans in the paleta. so yummy! every popsicle has an impression of betty's bite mark. so cute.   there are also popsicles for the dogs. they are like frozen chicken treats.   *don't forget to bring cash because they take cash only.</u_review>
<u_review>i pretty much come here with large parties (the tables allow for huge groups) or when i just can't make my mind up on what i feel like eating because this place has a little bit of everything.   i've tried quite a few different things on the menu and it has all been pretty good. nothing spectacular, but not disappointing either. the chicken madeira and the farfalle w/ chicken and roasted garlic (tell them to hold some of the garlic) are among my favorites.  and the cheesecake is always good. lots of different varieties. snickers, turtle, tuxedo, strawberry, etc. they are all good. but i've never met a piece of cheesecake i didn't devour.</u_review>
<u_review>i hang out on restaurant patios as much as possible this time of year. this place has a huge covered patio, which is always a plus in az. the restaurant is located in a high traffic area, but i really didn't hear any of the noise from the traffic.   i came here for happy hour and it was busy. they have lots of high tops outside, but they quickly fill up if you come around five o'clock. the crowds dwindled down outside by about 6-6:30 pm, which is great if you want to sit on the patio and take advantage of their happy hour.  they have discounts on drinks and apps are 25% off from 3-7 pm  mon-fri. they also have other drinks specials that change everyday.  it started getting a little chilly once the sun set, but they started a fire in the outdoor fireplace which was surrounded by some pretty comfortable chairs and a love seat, another plus. didn't try any food, but the menu looked pretty good (standard american food) and the prices looked reasonable. looks like a great lunch spot. i'll have to come back and have something to eat next time.</u_review>
<b_review>after reading the past reviews, most of it has been said.  the service was great, the beer is great, and the food is fantastic...  our visit was late afternoon on a saturday, and it was crowded and very noisy.  guess that is to be expected with a college age crowd.  we are elderly, probably don't hear as well as we should, but conversation was difficult, even seated in the back by the beer tanks.</b_review>
<b_review>i've had four peaks beer before but hadn't made it to the actual brewery in tempe.  we stopped by on a saturday afternoon and after some parking issues (we have to park on the street!) we realized it was packed.  i thought we'd be waiting 20+ minutes but they got our party of 8 people seated within 10 minutes.  nice!  i had a stout, and i can't remember the name but it was really good.  our server was very patient and sweet while all eight of us ordered different stuff, wanting to add/leave out the mushrooms, etc.  she got everything right and came to check on us multiple times.  we made sure to give her a very generous tip.  my fiance and i had the garlic cheesey bread as an appetizer and split a vegetarian pizza for our meal (and i also ordered a side salad- i was starving!)  the cheesey bread was loaded with garlic- so beware.  i'm a huge fan so i was loving the huge chunks of fresh garlic mixed with delicious cheese, but if you were expecting garlic "flavor", it might be a bit strong.  the pizza had a great variety of vegetables, and a pesto sauce which was great.  the only drawback is that it was incredibly salty, and i think that was a result of the sodium in the pesyo and the artichoke hearts on the pizza.   overall, a great experience but i'll probably order a different pizza next time.</b_review>
<b_review>great place to come and enjoy food, watch some games (tv's aren't that big but there are a lot of them), and hang out with friends.  i sat at the bar where i waited for one of my friends to arrive. like always the bartenders are nice, trying to work for their tips (can't blame them).  i was promptly asked if i needed a drink and a menu. of course i accepted. she came back quickly to ask if i was ready to order. i explained that my friend was coming and i was going to wait to order food.  no complaints so far, great service.  my friend comes he gets his drink order promptly and looks at the menu, i finish my first drink and they come by and get me another. woah standard bar treatment. who would have thought.  okay anyways thats pretty much the last we heard of the bartenders unless we flagged them down (and i hate doing that cause i feel like a jerk). anyways we flagged them down for our food order, more drinks, water, and the bill.  they would have gotten a solid 4 stars. the service fell short in the end on my experience was a 3 star.   the food was great i got the chicken sandwich... it was huge, i recommend it. beer batter fries were maybe some of the best i have tasted. for real i will come back and i hope to upgrade them to a four star...unless the service is the same then it will be 3.</b_review>
<b_review>great beer. a flight of 9 for $9 is great. you get a little 4-6 oz tasting of each and we liked them all. my favorite was the peach ale. had the beer battered fries and our party demolished it. crispy and well seasoned. friendly service and fun atmosphere.</b_review>

<text>nice atmosphere with lots of reasonably priced wine.  i asked if there was a corkage and my hostess said no but there is a $10 discount if you take it home.  so yes - there is a corkage.  had the boar chops which the server insisted should be medium or they would be bloody.  ordered medium rate - at least the cooks know what they are doing.  the chops were cooked nicely.  unfortunately they were covered with a crappy bbq sauce that almost single handily destroyed the meal.  fortunately for the crappy bbq sauce there were super salty veggies.  so much salt that they took the honor of destroying the dish.   too bad - chops were good.</text>
<u_review>nice brunch.  $15 includes mimosa's, a small buffet bar with made-to-order pancakes, and assorted goodies.  another $6 and you get your choice of some nice egg dishes.</u_review>
<u_review>tonto does a good job of infusing southwestern flair into the menu with prickly pear margaritas and bison steaks.  i just get the feeling that sometimes one can go too far.    salmon with bbq sauce?  my short ribs were nicely cooked but they were smothered in a sauce which sort of distracts from the flavor.  other items were equally hit and miss.    the crab cakes are surprisingly good with a nice spicy slaw.</u_review>
<u_review>the ambiance is nice and the servers are friendly.  food is so so.  they have deviled eggs and i always try to order when i see them on a menu.  these were nice with bacon but flavor was traditional.  not bad but not worth buying again.  had the green chile burger - those are always my favorite.  they are not my favorite when you take a burger and just toss a chile on it.   you can't be bothered to take the giant pickles off the burger?  sure i can take them off myself but i like to eat my food the way the chef intended.  if this is it, the chef missed the mark.   all the rave reviews i had to try the kale salad.  sure it's kale - woot woot - but it's a bland kale salad.    fun place to hang but so are a lot of places.  maybe i needed to eat a cookie.</u_review>
<u_review>the grind in arcadia used to be my favorite burger joint but their service went downhill.  i was hoping this one was better.  it is.  outdoor seating  - sweet.  the burgers are a little different than arcadia, bu the menu is the same.</u_review>
<b_review>pass me some hummus! d-vine is a small wine bar in mesa, which has excellent food.  i hadn't been there for a few years, so was expecting the food quality to have gone down, since they've opened up another location and that typically means the food begins to taste "chainy".  this was not the case at all, (good thing because we had terrible service).   i'm going to give them somewhat of a pass on the service, because it was saturday night and the place was packed.   i'm just glad we caught the extra $44 we were charged for our wine, before we left the building.  okay, now back to the food.    we started off with a hummus tray, the pita bread was amazing! it was perfectly grilled and seasoned,  i could have eaten the whole plate.  for dinner, i ordered the mac- n-cheese without the pork, sub veggies.   the rest of the table ordered a flat iron steak, filet, and chicken, these came out perfectly cooked and with decent portion sizes.  i know this because i waited almost 10 minutes for my pasta to come out, after they had been served.  when my food came out it was a bowl of pasta with more of an alfredo sauce, a little cheese crisped on top then covered in veggies (including potatoes which was weird).  it was very good, but didn't resemble a mac-n- cheese at all.  i was also a little annoyed, because they charged me and extra $3 for the veggies even though i didn't get the pork.  for dessert we had their prickly pear crème brulee special... omg it was amazing!  i'm glad we finished the meal off strong, because the service was train wreck from beginning to end, which is the only reason d-vine is not receiving a 4, or maybe even a 5 star rating (which is very rare for me).   despite the service, we still had a nice dinner and will definitely be back.   i am looking forward to getting an opportunity to update my rating and enjoying some delicious food and wine.</b_review>
<b_review>09.04.10  great little place! great service! great food!  we ordered happy hour appetizers: mushroom fries, mini cuban sandwich and mixed green salad.  all were yummy!  definitely a place we'll visit again next time we're on that side of the valley!</b_review>
<b_review>this place was weird. i felt like it was a weird crowd and weird people and just weird. we got the flight of white wine  (i dont remember which ones) which were good i suppose. we tried their apple and brie cheese bruschetta  and it was not very good at all. just apple and brie cheese, thats it, nothing more, nothing less. nothing like postino wine bar's apple and brie cheese bruschetta (maybe theirs is so delicious that nothing compares.) they have art work all over which is neat. other than that, i was just weirded out by this place. my friends always go to the other location and love it so maybe i will like this place better   if i go to that location, i don't know. maybe it was a full moon that night that i went? ha i don't know.</b_review>
<b_review>this place was definitely a nice surprise. it's location is near the grocery store my friends and i always stopped at before heading to the salt river...so i was surprised that such a classy joint was located across the street.  the vibe was very nice and the atmosphere was that of pure sophistication, though i can't praise the establishment fully. though the selection of wine was impressive, and the live music was delightful, there were almost no options for a vegetarian. there wasn't a single entree that could be made meat free and still be substantial. i ended up getting bruschetta. it was decent, though nothing memorable...and not very filling.   so vegetarians, beware! this place was not meant for us, sadly :(</b_review>

<text>the unfortunately named xtreme bean company is actually quite a homey lil place. located near jo anns fabric in what i refer to as a concrete island (meaning it is part of a strip mall, but not technically connected to said strip mall) with it's own mini-drive through, it is also across the street from sunflower market.   at first it feels like a starfucks rip-off, but the actually delicious looking pastries, cheap prices and staff with actual personalities changes that impression fast. a diverse crowd enjoys the brew here, all kinds of seating (esp. the rather weirdly inviting cubicle room for studying that reminds me of real genius for some reason...maybe it was the bearded guy in there), and plenty of outdoor seating.  my tasty bagel and decaf coffee with soy came out to under 4 bucks and was quite good.  with all the seating and good 'vibes' in this place, a great place for studying or procastinating on studying.   you could bring your dirty hipster friend or your mom here-and that is a good thing.  ***  no taxation on lactose intoleration  after a couple more times coming here, you know what?  not impressed.  i don't like it. i can't eat anything, there is never any seating except in that creepy back room that is supposed to be a study area but always has people babbling away, and i am sick of the dirty hipster punks smoking their anarchy, corporate-sponsored lungs outside.  final straw? i had an entirely unreasonable fight with a barista regarding soy! wtf? i ordered just a regular decaf coffee, and politely asked if they kept soy on the kiosk (you know the one with sugar and milk stuff), and she said they keep it in the fridge. i asked her if i could have some. i notice my total is wrong and go over the order again. where did the extra 50 cents come in? "oh that is for soy." "um, that is like a thimble size of soy. i am not paying 50 cents for that." "well, that is the rule" "what rule? wildflower, three roots and a bunch of other places don't charge me to use a little bit of soy" "it costs extra to get soy." "i can get a full container of soy milk across the street at sunflower for a little over a buck. would you prefer i just got a container there for that amount and brought it back with me?" "soy milk costs like, over 3 bucks.." (this statement is accompanied with an eye roll). "look, i am vegan (a white lie) and extremely lactose intolerance. i can't have milk. they don't get charged for milk. i am not paying that amount. can i just talk to your manager?" "we don't like have one right now" (i swear to god she really talked like this) at this point, some laid back guy just said, "dude don't charge her." i thanked him, saying i wasn't trying to be difficult, but paying that much was ridiculous, and he agreed since he was vegan himself.   i called back several times and never got a call back regarding the soy incident.  i know i sound crazy, but goddamn, i am sick of the lactose intolerance tax! soy is hip! everybody drinks soy! and you can get it cheap!  xtreme jerks.</text>
<u_review>i can thank three women who talked at a table at barrio cafe with no food or drinks for 45 minutes while a birthday group waited for their spot for guiding my friend to fish market for dinner!  i scanned quickly the reviews on yelp on mr. mustachios iphone and thumbs upped it. it may not be mind blowing, but your waitress flo will be right on top of you with iced tea refills, no plate will remain in front of you after you have mangled the body and she is quick with a to go container. what was that? a large party of 12, billing pains? nope, she figured out who was with who and had everyones bill divvied up after making sure no desserts were in order.     i remember reading the rainbow trout was safe, so i picked the walnut encrusted rainbow fish covered in an avocado mixture with roasted veggies and jasmine rice for us to share and saw the relatively cheap artichoke heart under 5 bucks and went for it.  she split our plates for us and the portion was perfect. the artichoke heart came with garlic ailoi, chipolte aioli and butter and was a table favourite. the fish was delicious, the rice fine and the veggies were good but obviously drenched in butter and not olive oil-but compared to the mostly bland or fried options for sides on the menu, i truly think we got the best dish there.  the waitress even brought out a creme brulee birthday cake for us and brought out a cap and giant bib that was beyond camp for the b-day girl and didn't rush us even as we stayed an hour after closing-that is class.  so why the three stars? first is definitely ambiance. for parents who don't eat out much, this would be perfect-very suburban, safe, brass fixtures, plate glass with lobsters frosted on it, lots of large pictures of bloody fish and drunk fisherman near the tables. i felt i was in rural pa sometimes. not such a great feeling.  thirdly, while i did learn to love the fish via boston, i was just not excited about most of their options-a lot of were fried and i am not a fan of the dairy drenched veggie. i don't think i would really like to try anything else on the menu except for exactly what i ordered-not much incentive for a return date!  overall, a really positive experience that i highly encourage other people, even jaded hipsters, to try. stifle your laughter and order the rainbowfish trout-and yes, you can get a fish market paper hat on the way out to the club later.</u_review>
<u_review>this was the only place near by i considered an option for stealing a delicious beer during lunch (which at the time was 6pm) to deal with the hell that is big box office land. of course, moes next door always has dirt cheap domestic beers (top secret!), but not really a place to relax and enjoy a beer or two with friends.  it is a really big place, and i have never seen it filled. the servers are sweet, but seriously lacking in the getting the drink order and getting the check department. the first time i came there, i had to find someone to just run my card since we had to get back to work-lame. there are plenty of other office space dwellers that frequent here happy hour time, so be prepared for a rather eclectic (yet oddly generic) mix of people at this bar-there are plenty of office flirations and gossip being played out here. the beer selection isn't fantastic and their prices are east coast range average, which is pretty lame, but i always enjoyed whatever i ordered.  that being said, their frito pie appetizer may be the most disgusting and delicious food item i have paid for. it seriously tastes like something my stoner brother in high school would have concocted at 3:30am to eat while watching mtvs headbanger ball. "layers of fritos, chili, cheddar cheese, sour cream, onions & tomato", reads the on-line menu....yeah people. its fucking delish. and its almost 9 bucks! yeah,,,you see the problem. the fries are tasty..and too much. they do have soy beans...for 4 bucks, the most i have ever seen edamame for-and while they can replace any burger with a veggie burger, the burgers cost like 9 bucks! i could buy two big packages of veggie burgers easy for that amount!   so not really a destination bar, more like a "well...this is the only bar" kind of bar. but if you give your full order when you first sit down and give the waiter your card to run, you will enjoy your time much more since it won't be wasted waiting for beer or checks.</u_review>
<u_review>so this vegan walks into a deli....  normally this is a punch line. vegans don't walk into delis, b/c there ain't shit to eat!  as a lactose-intolerant vegetarian (me heartz eggz), most lunch places are a bust. after a grueling bike ride up and down a very windy green path, rikki (the wise vegan who referred me to simply bread) recommended this cute spot. i was skeptical, but she promised vegan enchiladas, so i was game.  it is an adorable patio, a secret garden of commerce off of mill, and the place was completely different than i thought it would be-there isn't row of cheese and meat on the shelves, but giant bowls of amazing grains and greens that rival whole foods in appeal. i was overwhelmed for a moment since i was told the soup was vegan as well. well, then. i opted for the indonesian rice with a greens salad w/sprouts and cilantro vinaigrette and lentil soup, rikki got the same plate but a side of extremely garlic hummus w/whole wheat pita.  it was a heaping plate of food on a tray and i couldn't help but reach for the oatmeal cookie (what else are 20 mile bike rides for?), it wasn't vegan but small enough. they had blue sky and hansen soda flavors, but i was a good girl and stuck to the water bottle i had.  holy shit.  this food is amazing. seriously. i really should have only eaten half the plate, but i cleaned everything up. i actually shut up. if you are sitting with me and i am quiet at the table, then you know i am very very happy. the rice was fluffy, flavorful, the salad incredibly fresh, the lentil great with the spices of cumin and hot sauce i added to (they have a lazy susan of spices inside!)  sitting on a patio makes a huge difference, i wanted disney birds to comb my hair with seashell combs i was so blissed out. my tray was under $9 and for portions, a great deal. i was able to use the plaza toilet and the guy working was super nice, answered all my questions re: ingredients and offered more water for my bottle.   only complaints are no vegan desserts and  all the packaging like styrofoam plates, plastic utensils, paper napkins. i know this is normal deli stuff, but compost-able material would make me happier since they seem earth friendly. maybe i will just bring my own utensils/plates .......god, i sound like a dirty hippy.  i don't know who lydia, the owner according to other reviewers is, but i just may make her my valentine, b/c i actually have a place to have lunch near by!   they change their menu all the time and open 11-4 m-f, fyi.  enjoy...and you better leave me some indonesian rice or i will spork stab you.</u_review>
<u_review>now....before all you postino lovers chew me out, the reason i give three stars is quite simple...i am in no hurry to go back. now this doesn't mean the service was bad, the food was mediocre, the wine selection limited, the decor unpleasant. it wasn't any of those descriptives. it simply wasn't above above average.  i went there on a weekday night, late, and had a dinner date. we were seated next to the wine selection since we ended up at the tail-end of the busy dinner time of postinos. the place is really beautiful-well designed, warm, full of sophisticated, cultivated people tinkling upscale laughter. there aren't much options for the lactose intolerant vegetarian, so i went with the bruschetta sampler. and while it was tasty, i wasn't quite blown away. the combinations were good...but is it really good date food to chew on crispy crunchy bread loaded with crap that falls off all over the place?  the wine selection is overwhelming, but was pleased with the server who helped us out on a bold, juicy cab in a reasonable (read: cheap) bottle.  i really liked the look of the bar and if i went back here probably would hit that up with wine and maybe some dessert after dinner somewhere else.  this place is beautiful. the patio especially looks elegant and reclusive enough for your next affair. but the ambiance is just off. i can't quite put my finger on it, but it seems to lack a kind of personality or quirk. kind of like when you visit a perfectionist's home and it feels rather cool or crisp, but then you love your messy, quirky friends home b/c you can relax and not use a coaster.   it is a perfect date place...but in a rather generic way. this place, in fact, screams date place. i imagine it was booked for upcoming valentine's day back on feb. 15, 2006....which to me, just isn't any fun.</u_review>
<b_review>nice staff, great hours! dirty and damaged furniture, due to excessive wear. my mocha with 0.25 the chocolate was still super nauseating with sugar.</b_review>
<b_review>not a fan, but i keep coming back due to old habits.... the previous coffee shop in this location was excellent. this one has mediocre coffee and a very slow internet connection. not a good combo if you want non-grumpy customers.</b_review>
<b_review>i used to be a student and this place was awesome for studying and keeping caffeinated.  now though, when i go there to relax, i feel like i'm sitting in a study hall with a coffee bar in it.  more power to them for catering to students, we all know these places are hard to find.  but, if you're a few years graduated, you may want to try somewhere else...or just get their coffee to go (it's very tasty).</b_review>
<b_review>did this place used to be a bank? i was trying to figure out what one of the dark little studying holes used to be. it had an interesting door, which i assume was some type of vault before? oh well, that's not really important.   i think that this place is the coffee shop i've been looking for. good drinks, reliable wifi even for the amount of people that are there using it. there's even a drive thru for people that want something on the go. the only beef i have with this place is no splenda. wtf. there's only equal offered as a sugar substitute.  this is the only thing keeping me from giving five stars, because they have great hours too.</b_review>

<text>we were excited to casablanca for date night, as we loved it when it was the estate house. we arrived a bit early for our 7:30pm reservations and were led outside, past all of the cozy seats inside. i thought it odd we weren't asked for a preference.   but wait--it got worse. we were also taken past all of the cozy couches outside facing the movie playing and seated at this strange area way in the back. between our two chairs, which overlooked the street, we had a giant heater and small table (in may). so much for date night. (the light-up menus are totally cool, though the selection is small.)  but wait--it still gets worse. apparently our corner was the smoking area (!?), so they actually seated me, a severe asthmatic, in the middle of it. thanks.  we ordered a crab dip, the sliders and the tacos. while waiting, we did get our well-mixed drinks. but then our waiter totally disappeared. after 35 minutes a water guy apologized for our slow food service. after 45 minutes it finally appeared. the two pork dishes were ok--but served totally lukewarm. the tacos were beautifully plated; the limes even had perfect grill marks on them. but couldn't they put that much care into getting me my damn food in a timely manner? while it's still hot? we didn't care for the crab dip, but that could be a personal thing. the plantain chips were yummy.  the final rub came with the service. our waiter literally never came back after taking our order. when we decided we had enough, we actually went inside and stood at the empty bar and asked for our tab. interestingly, no one thought that was odd.  so there we go. bad service, mediocre food. we won't be back.</text>
<u_review>when they say a serious slice, they mean it. these are giant (and we're big eaters, folks). for $5 you get a slice of cheese pizza and a drink. you can upgrade combos with salads, wings, etc.  extra toppings are $.50 each. hint: they are really generous with mushrooms, which are thick and meaty.  while the crust was firm (you can actually pick up the monster slice--no folding needed) it wasn't great (on the crusty end--just not great flavor to it).  we're big fans of the slightly spicy sauce though.</u_review>
<u_review>gallo blanco has made so many best-of lists we weren't sure it could live up to the hype. but the food did.  we came on a thursday night around 7pm and waited in the bar for a table. get the paloma--it's like a marg but with grapefruit juice. not too tart, it was perfectly mixed.  we had a couple of tortas--they were amazing. if you're super hungry, get a couple of sides, too. the chorizo had a nice bite (as did the salsas they brought). my pork was tender and flavorful, though i think we all wished we had gotten the open-face naco (i think) torta. hubby got the burrito and said it was ok. we finished with tres leches which was just ok; i wouldn't get it again.  the service was hipster-laid back (so don't expect it to be attentive, ok?).  our only other comment, and the reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5, was the damn noise level. seriously, it's loud in there.   but yah, we'd definitely go back. the food was really yummy and reasonably priced!</u_review>
<u_review>went back and the horchata was delish. hubby had street tacos and thought the flavor was great. i stuck with my faves, the $2.50 desert dogs. get two, really.</u_review>
<u_review>made 7:30 reservations for a friday night. started at the totally-dead bar for a well-mixed cocktail. it definitely fit the new "artesan cocktail" trend and was similarly priced. hubby had a jack and coke.  we started with the head cheese appetizer. although the waiter could describe the process of making head cheese, it was clear, once we received our dish, that he had never eaten it (it wasn't gelatenous at all). it was delicious, even though it took nearly 40 min to leave the kitchen in a half-full dining room. our dining companions got the olive plate.  for mains, hubby got a delicious pizza. not big enough for sharing as a main course, it was definitely a personal-pizza size. the crust was fluffy and flavorful. i ate a seasonal pumpkin pasta dish, which was a bit too al dente for my taste but still delicious.  for dessert we shared the applesauce cake, which was delicious.  so, for pros: --comfy chairs (and thank god for that, because the service was sloooooooow) --good food --takes reservations --has their own parking --love the rollup doors for a fresh breeze --quality cocktails  cons: --really ugly chairs and tables (think: denny's ugly) --small portions --really slow service (in a half-empty restaurant).  still, we'd definitely recommend this place to others!</u_review>
<b_review>this place was really cool. you can call for a reservation or make one at opentable.com (which is what i did).  the one complaint i had (lets get it out of the way now) is that i tried to reserve a table for 8 (girls night out) and opentable kept giving me the message that that wouldnt be possible for several months. when we got there, it was empty, and even after it filled up there were plenty of tables for a party that size wide open.  ok. glad i got that out of my system.  the ambiance here is great. dimly lit, very lavish comfortable seating areas. the staff was friendly and the menus light up! i just think that thats a brilliant idea. there are so many places that i see people using their cell phone to read menus or sign their tabs. here, both the menu and tab jacket light up. they also leave an ipad at your table that has lists of all their cocktails, beers, wines, and spirits at your table. which was cool. i had their cocktail that has "japanese" in the title. it was good, but not really my thing. my second drink was mixed beautifully however. i was suprised at how limited their vodka selection was though (personal preference).  all in all, this was a great place to start the evening.</b_review>
<b_review>wow has this place gone downhill. now we get attitude and poor cocktail skills the people who opened this place are gone, and it shows i won't be back. not fun any more.</b_review>
<b_review>ambiance is great..good location.. great starter place with friends, or a date night.  love the music.. (a live jazz night would be awesome)  lost a star for service.. they seem confused, drinks are expensive</b_review>
<b_review>it's places like these that really makes me hate going out in scottsdale.  a pretentious, somber lit establishment where waitresses look like dita von tease.  the one pro of this place is the lit up menus.  those are pretty rad.  i will not be coming back!!</b_review>

<text>let me know when you people fix the goddamn air-conditioning, and i'll *consider* coming back for a second try.   it is an outrage that you dared to open this in august/september, knew there was an a/c problem (as evidenced by the comments of your staff when some in our party complained), and have still done nothing about it as of late september. absolutely infuriating to walk into a place on a 100-degree night only to find it feeling like 105 inside. i should've listened to the game on the radio in my car. when the waitress asked if there was anything else she could get for us, i almost said "yeah, a shower."</text>
<u_review>what a load of absolutely hideous, uninteresting crap.  take every single one-star review written by yelpers below, copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything i can come up with.  i have no reason to ever come here. certainly not free will. the one time i did come here i was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend.</u_review>
<u_review>madison is a shitty park in a festering cesspool area of central phoenix. i was forced to play several softball games here because the other trash-filled field where my team usually plays lost its lighting, because bandits stole its copper wiring.   there are, of course, no fences to divide the softball fields. which means that you can't hit a bona fide home run. when a player does hit a ball hard enough for what would be a home run, you the outfielder have to sprint like hell to finally catch up to it for absolutely no reason, since by the time you glove the ball the hitter is rounding third base to score.   one night, we noticed a bum watching us play, which we thought was okay. until, that is, the 4th inning, when he suddenly went for one of our backpacks while we were in the field and bolted like a bat out of hell. this happened because, of course, there are no dugouts. a wooden board nailed to some stumps, yes. dugout, no.   if you're female, there is a chance you will be sexually assaulted in the parking lot. just a helpful tip.   the last time i played there a few weeks ago, i hit a triple and sprinted into 3rd base like i was 18 years old. only, i'm 35. my knee was instantly demolished as i crashed into the base and right now i'm not sure i'll ever be able to run again. this remains my last memory of madison park. how fitting.</u_review>
<u_review>decent food. reasonable prices. but unreasonable wait times that aren't justified. i'll stand in line for hours to eat at bianco's or los dos, who at least have the decency to provide us with entertainment during the wait. but i'm not going to do so for merely "decent" food.  edit: did i mention the horrendous and extremely aggravating parking situation?</u_review>
<u_review>coach and willies' downtown location is the place to go for a beer before a ball game at near-by chase field, or us airways arena, both of which are within walking distance (even in 110 degree heat). locals like myself know this place to be a hang-out for baseball executives and other local business folks, when it's not game time. you can also have lunch and dinner here, with typical bar menus but high-quality food. my favorite is the lobster bisque, which doesn't really taste like authentic lobster bisque to me but whatever they do to it... it's really good.   the only caveat is that i find its hours of business to be unpredictable. downtown phoenix is funny that way. it's almost always open for weekday lunch due to the downtown work crowd, but i wouldn't head there for dinner without calling ahead first. friday and saturday nights it's converted into (i'm not making this up) a loud, thumping gangster nightclub. i wandered in one boring weekend night and they had several policemen milling around for security, not to mention the metal detector. hopefully all this will change once the nearby summit at copper square (upscale residential complex next door; construction to be finished in 2008) and "w" hotel (also 2008) are established.</u_review>
<b_review>oh dear, how awful! 13 dollars for a wrap type of pannini sandwich, cold fries and not very good sweet potato chips that they swear are homemade. hmmmmmm!  i came home to food poisoning and i have a flight to catch tomorrow. i did like the jalapeno dipping sauce but what's the point if there is no good food to dip in it? ;(  the servers were very nice, and the televisions with sports were a plenty if that's your thing but the food was terrible.</b_review>
<b_review>it'd be nice if these cheap bastards would provide wifi. is it really that taxing upon you? how hard is it to set a guest network that doesn't kick you off after 2 hours while you spend $80-$100 with your girl here??? add .05 to your beer price and make up for it if its hurting you that bad. go to hazelwoods across the street instead.</b_review>
<b_review>zipp's is a slightly more upscale version of another sports bar across the street, hazelwood's.  blah food, overpriced drinks, happy hour specials that aren't all that special and hit-or-miss service.  if you go, limit your expectations and you should be fine.</b_review>
<b_review>not a bad for a bar in a strip mall. tons of tvs and plenty of seating. typical bar food. service was attentive. overall a good spot to kick back and have a cocktail and take in a game. will be back for football!</b_review>

<text>sorry, black chile... i just wasn't a fan!  jared and i felt like trying something new one night last week, and after reading about how great black chile's burger was from our friends at eateraz, we thought we'd give this place a shot.  the restaurant itself is spacious, the hostess and service attentive and friendly, and the decor is tasteful.  but unfortunately the food was nothing special, and i won't be rushing back...  we started with chips and salsa.  i think they bring these to everyone.  these weren't bad.  for our meals, jared went with the burger and i went for the fish tacos (per our waitress's recommendation) and a side of corn.  i liked the sticky rice and beans it came with but the rest of the meal was underwhelming.  jared didn't love his either.  since my visit, i learned that this concept comes from restaurateurs michael mcdermott and jason merritt, who have been involved with the development of numerous restaurants including the famed kona grill. i thought it felt a little chainy!  that explains it ;)  i'm pregnant so i didn't have a corona or margarita, which may have made my meal taste better, but regardless, i've experienced much better mexican food before... and with so many other mexican concepts to choose from in the valley, i probably won't be rushing back. lo siento again, black chile!</text>
<u_review>yay for good skin exams!  i admit i was a slacker for the past few years and didn't go for my annual full body check at the dermatologist.  therefore, i was a little nervous about my appointment.  not only did i have a few freckles / sun spots / moles that popped up over the years, but i had a baby too... and god knows what happens to your skin during a pregnancy and beyond!  anyways, i knew it was time for a visit, but i didn't have time to trek to north phoenix to the sister office of scottsdale dermatology ltd (see my review for that office here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenix-dermatology-ltd-phoenix#hrid:xpnvqtmh5mp_me0fem3yrg), where i'd been before, so i trusted my husband on this one and called this location instead.  the woman that answered the phone was super friendly and scheduled an appointment for me to see kendall jenson, pa-c the following week.    when the time came for my appointment, i followed the directions to this office on my yelp app, and i was pleasantly surprised to see how close it was to where i live and work, and there was plenty of shaded street parking when i arrived... bonus!  i didn't have to wait too long once i arrived, and i had a good experience.  luckily, kendall was not too concerned about any of my freckles/sun spots/ moles, and he answered all of the questions i had for him.  before i left, they had me self address a post card that they will send to me for my annual visit next year... hopefully, i'll keep up with my annual appointments going forward.  now that i have a dermatologist nearby, i really have no excuses.  what's yours?!</u_review>
<u_review>maybe i feel bad after giving the north scottsdale location a 2 star review, so i'm upgrading and giving this one another star...   since we've moved, jared has been sending his shirts and suits to this location.  i am sometimes the one who does pick up duty, so i've been to this prestige several times, and i must say, they are super friendly and do a good job... plus, their prices for men's shirts are not bad... $2.30 each i think (unless it's name brand in which case it's more).  today, i picked up a suit and i noticed the charge for that was $22.40 - that's kind of a lot, dontcha think?  correct me if i'm wrong - i have no clue when it comes to suits.  i can tell you though, that prestige does a really good job... if $$ were not an issue, i'd use prestige all of the time!</u_review>
<u_review>i feel like i'm being extremely generous with this one.  luckily for hot, i had great company which made my overall rating higher than they might deserve.  3.7 stars total - based on the following...  ambiance - 5 stars in a historic house with both indoor and outdoor seating, this is an amazing atmosphere; better than most of the strip malls that the valley is known for!  service - 4 stars the hostess went above and beyond by moving us from an inside table to an outside table by the fire when we had a change of heart and wanted some fresh air.  they also went above and beyond to help me find a parking spot as i didn't want my car to get towed from the lot next door like patti b. yelped about previously.  larissa was our server and she was extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  there was only one thing that was a bit disappointing when it came to service:  that she came by to take our order and i told her i needed a minute and she said she'd be right back but disappeared for around 10 or 15 minutes.  food - 2.5 stars let me explain:  i chose wrong.  do not order the seafood pistou.  larissa told me that it was a 'messy' dish, but not minding that, i ordered it anyways.  it was not messy, it was just kind of gross.  the seafood didn't taste so fresh and i think the combo of that and the creamy heavy sauce were what gave me a horrible stomach ache that evening.  however, kristin c. chose right - she had the ahi tuna... it was a beautiful presentation and according to kristin, it was fantastic!  note to self:  order ahi if i ever return!  oh, and i tasted the asian pear salad too - it was tasty.  so, the 2.5 star rating is an average...   company - 5 stars! i'm going to allow the fact that i had a really fun dining companion bring up the average a bit here...  bang for your buck- 2 stars we had only water and perrier to drink and our bill was still kind of high for what i thought was just an ok meal... essentially 1 salad, 2 entrees, and 1 perrier was over $80 out the door!  i admit that this review is based on just one experience... however, because of the fact that i have no clue when i'll go back, i wanted to review it anyways!  if you go to hot, go for the ambiance and order the tuna! :)</u_review>
<u_review>i'm being on the generous side in giving mebad (as i've seen others refer to this place) 4 stars...  it's kind of a unique gem that you don't see anymore with the owner at the register and a slamming lunch business in addition to the grocery items for sale that are rare foods, snacks, and ingredients from the middle east.   i suggested this place for lunch with amy d today after reading about it on yelp awhile back... so happy i finally made it there myself!  as amy said in her review, we shared the baba ganoush and hummus plate and we each ordered a greek salad.  the salad was decent but nothing special, but the baba and hummus with the whole wheat pita was so damn tasty that we didn't even leave a bite.  the free cup of homemade daily lemonade was a perk and the owner was really sweet... and i really did like the flavor of it.  i happen to love lemonade!  i'll for sure return to mebad when i'm in the area to try more from their menu... this is the kind of place you want people to know about since you can tell how much work the owner and staff put into it each day.  if you haven't been, stop by... maybe i'll see you there - but please don't ask me to share my baba ganoush and hummus with you - i'm ordering my own next time!</u_review>
<b_review>i really liked this place!  the food actually reminded me of blanco's in scottsdale which is also super yummy!   great service, great location in the biltmore, nice decor and yummy food!</b_review>
<b_review>my girlfriend and i decided to check this place out after getting a coupon in the mail.   we started with the cotija grilled corn, which i was skeptical about since i don't really like corn on the cob. it was actually so good that i finished mine and had the urge to steal hers right out of her hands. (i was able to restrain myself.)   i ordered the black chile, which was really good, but i think it could have used a little more spice. to be fair, i like really spicy food though. the rice was not traditional, but i really liked it. the beans i loved, which is unusual for me.   my girlfriend had the beef enchiladas, which she loved, and i thought were really good as well. she wasn't a fan of the beans like i was, but loved the rice.   i have saved the best for last though.. the drinks. well, really just one drink in particular. the strawberry jalapeno margarita was the best margarita i have ever had in my life. i actually find myself craving it. i will definitely be back for another of those, and to try some of the other drinks and menu offerings.</b_review>
<b_review>fan-freaking-tastic shrimp tacos + modella especial in a bottle (serviced with an icy pint glass) + good (free) chips and salsa = a very happy meghan m.    happy hour specials looked great but just enjoying lunch on the patio was a perfect start to a few days in phoenix.</b_review>
<b_review>eh...  would be great mexican food in oklahoma city or ohio, not phoenix.  would be like eating at bucca de beppo in little italy.   my 13.00 top shelf marg was so sweet i could barely drink it.  pork was good but tasted like bar-b-q not carnitas.  for a chain go to chipotle, for the real thing go to barrio cafe.  bright spot was tomatillo salsa, very good.</b_review>

<text>youch! waited for 30 minutes and the place wasn't even busy.. slow service.. even slower kitchen.. pollo fundido was cold (un-melted cheese, stone cold chicken) and tasted like it had been in the fridge for a while! if the stove is broken or the dishwasher, whatever the problem, you really should communicate that to your guests.  the green pond in the back was kind of different..</text>
<u_review>stefano fabbri, owner of pomo pizzeria, is not only passionate about his food, but he has a contagious enthusiasm that's informative and downright convincing.  the pomo pizzeria napoletana at the borgota in scottsdale is a sleek and beautiful space. the dining room has soaring ceilings, dark furniture and a mural showing someone riding a scooter in the streets of italy. it appears to be another trendy, albeit sexy, pizzeria, but it's actually more than that.  pomo recently earned a certification from the naples-based associazione verace pizza napoletana, meaning that everything from the flour, olive oil, kneading and baking meets exacting standards. this is a pretty big deal considering there are only a few dozen restaurants in the country that have this certification. but the staff doesn't let the honor go to their heads; service is friendly and attentive.  pizza is the name of the game here, and seeing it prepared is a blast. in the open part of the kitchen you'll see a classic red berkel meat slicer used to prepare the selection of cured meats. this is one serious meat slicer that i can only dream of having in my own kitchen. to see it in action i ordered the affettati misti ($14.95), a plate filled with the chef's choice of paper-thin slices of bresaola, prosciutto, salami, olives and cheese.  at lunchtime, pomo serves a handful of paninis, but these are not the typical grilled sandwiches. they quick bake fresh dough in a blistering hot oven that yields a slightly charred, yet light and crispy bread. then they stuff it full of italian goodness, like the salami panini ($9.95), which was filled with spicy salami, arugula and mozzarella cheese. served with a simple side salad, the panini was excellent and satisfying.  like the panini, pizzas are cooked in a wood-fired oven at around 900 degrees. this means that a pizza takes only about a minute and a half to cook. by naples standards, the pizzas are decidedly thin though surprisingly the crust isn't ultra crispy as one might expect. instead the crust is light and moist with an excellent toothsome chew.  fabbri recommended starting with the basics, and since he'd know best, ordering the regina margherita ($11.95) was on point. the tomato sauce was bright and sweet, then the flavor of the milky fresh mozzarella kicked in which was enhanced by fresh chopped basil.  another way to enjoy the stupendous crust was the calzone napoletano ($14.95), which is not your run of the mill calzone. it was filled with spicy salami, tomato sauce, mozzarella and ricotta. each creamy bite deserved another, as i wickedly ate the whole thing.  what better way to end than to order dessert? while they do have standards like tiramisu ($7.95) and panno cotta ($7.95), the light and airy semifreddo di mandorle ($7.95) was a standout. each bite of the partially frozen mousse was accented with a toasted pistachio crust. more please.  with a passion for tradition, this might be as close to an authentic italian pizza as you'll get without going to italy.</u_review>
<u_review>okay so theres a time in a persons life where they like to have choices.. lots and lots of choices.. well living in the southwest choice is abundant, so much so that the lists can be pages long when it comes to food and drink. its really overwhelming!  the mr and i like to take weeknight foodie plunges. generally on weeknights i'm slaving over a hot wok, comal or grill while the mr 'works' late, just managing to show up just in time to eat (life seems so unfair doesn't it?)! so when he got home last night and didn't see dinner ready he knew it was plunge night.   we both knew it had to be some sort of sandwich. we've been wanting to try a new place not to far from home called andreoli's but for some reason i thought they close early. so then i was up to bat.. torta's! oh yeah and i saw a write up in the new times last week for a place on 16th street. so we piled into the honda and headed west.  this place is only a few blocks south of the famed bario cafe. inside the place has been updated with tin roof walls and a clean open appearance. inside oddly enough was a very attractive blond woman (think uma thurman) cleaning off the tables. she was the nicest person i had met in some time! she walked us through the menu answering our questions and making many suggestions. we finally ordered 2 torta's and a quesadilla (a gurl has got to eat!)! she then invited us to their salsa bar.. 3 different salsas, pickled carrots/jalapeno and freshly sliced cucumbers. oh, beware.. the salsa's are on the spicy side and may cause pooper fire syndrome!   the tray arrived with our mexiches and quesadilla.. the mr bit into his pastor (4.99) and his eyes widened as if to attempt to make his mouth bigger by intimidation. large cubes of pork simmered in a spicy red sauce inside of nice thick bun that had been lightly toasted. on to my cubana (5.90).. this bad boy is also on a toasted bun though inside.. ham, roast pork, milaneza, cheese, lettuce and mayo. whew, it was good good good.   as we were noshing through the torta's the quesadilla caught my eye. it looked so lonely sitting there with melted cheese oozing from the edges.. so seductive, enticing.. fresh. i had to take a bite!  yeah babe, you're so good. the alambre (4.99) is filled with onions, cheese, beef and pork slices on a very large flour tortilla.. this alone was worth the drive! the texture of the onions and cheese against the tender meats and crispy tortilla was just delish! this paired nicely with the horchata (1.99)..  silky smooth and not overly sweet.  i guarantee next week when the mr gets home and the kitchen is dark and empty he will know it his turn to buy dinner!</u_review>
<u_review>my inner vietnamese woman seriously wanted steamed crab and garlic noodles last night for dinner though i have a rule..  we don't live anywhere close to the ocean so if i know its not flown in daily, i pass on my cravings. so away went my inner viet-lady and out came my inner italian macho man (quit laughing at me)!   the place is very cozy and definitely family owned, no corporate stamping here, this is the real deal. super tasty, hearty, large portioned basic italian.. just like mom would make if she were italian!   i went ahead and blew off my carnal seafood rule (i'm a big butch italian macho man, right) and went ahead and ordered the crab cakes. 2 huge crab cakes were more crab then cake covered in a thick creamy sauce with tomatoes and basil.. i did all i could not to lick the place clean.. mama always says i'm a proud member of the clean plate club!   for dinner i had the ravioli carbanara.. these plump pillows filled my plate.. covered in another rich cream sauce then topped with peas and bacon.. as i ate these i unbuttoned my shirt, i could see the hair on my chest growing, i indeed was becoming an italian macho man (in my own head)!   the service was extremely friendly and for the quality and quantity of food this place is a real bargain. crap cake $13, ravioli carbanara $18.. my man tummy, full and very very happy!</u_review>
<u_review>after the mekong visit and my patience worn completely thin i decided to go somewhere where the wait wasnt an hour. so headed to leelee and decided to try the attached restaurant there. whats funny is i passed 6 other pho places along dobson on my way.. it was a sign!   being in the mood for beef stew, i was told #48 was beef stew. so, ordered that to go. when i got it home i was shocked to see that it was pan cooked beef chunks with onions and sauce served over the top of lettuce and tomatoes. i was like fuck, that's gross! well, i had to take a bite, then another, then another, then another.. it was really good! not the bo ko i was craving but tasty none the less. the lettuce had wilted and was similar to a stew cause of all the moisture that was released.. a very good dish!  ill have to go back to try the pho.. though with all the other pho options i think a tour is in order.. anyone wanna do a dobson pho tour?</u_review>
<b_review>bleh. that's how i feel about my most visit to el encanto this past weekend. the service and overall experience was a huge disappointment, which left a yucky taste in my mouth.   first of all, we had a reservation- unfortunately for our party of seven, we had to wait 30 minutes past our reservation to be seated inside, after requesting to sit outside. now i know the restaurant can't help the fact that the patrons sitting at our table wouldn't leave after their meal was complete, but what the restaurant could have done would have been to come up with a solution faster than 30 minutes. we were finally sat in a mostly empty back room, with no ambiance, which felt awkward and unsatisfying. the restaurant manager was very friendly (kind of overly friendly) and offered to buy us guacamole as compensation. had the guac been more flavorful and bigger this might have been nice, but instead was a very little consolation prize for the long wait and the disappointment of where we were sat.   the food overall wasn't great. no one loved what they got. we found the chips to be greasy and the salsa just off. i did like my tamales, but wasn't blown away. i really feel if we had gotten to sit outside our experience would have been better, but really the food is mediocre at best. there are plenty of good mexican restaurants in the valley, i will opt for one of them next time.</b_review>
<b_review>blech, yuk, really??  well, i had family visiting from europe and made a list of places that i'd definitely want to take them.  penciled in at number 22 was this place - a charming restaurant in a charming town that i'd often taken out of town guests over the years.  big mistake.  it was terrible.    parking was in the very, very back as street vendors had taken over the parking lot selling what my dad affectionately calls ubs (useless bunch o' shite).    once we got through this, we put our name in for a table.  we were told it would be a 30 minute wait, and it was.  service was great, but beware of the bill padding and mediocre, at best, food.  there were 4 adults and 2 kids and our lunch was $100.  i had the chicken parcel thingys which were terrible and around $11. when hubby ordered fish tacos, they asked, "fish tacos with rice and beans?"  he said, "sure."  (add $4)  my kids ordered juice with their meals (add $4) - seems the kids meals come with milk or soda, not juice.  sister-in-law orderd enchiladas (add $4 - $2 for each one to add chicken), other sister-in-law ordered fajita salad with tortillas on the side (add $4 for tortillas).  you get the point, i'm sure :-)    however,  if the food was good, all of the ridiculous upcharges would have been bearable.  it wasn't.  mediocre food at best.</b_review>
<b_review>can i just say i love el encanto.  i took clients there for lunch the other day.  they are down for the 'season' from chicago.  they were just enamored by the atmosphere.  yes the birds can be bothersome, so don't sit by the pond!  at any rate, the service is always good, the food is fresh and piping hot.    my favorites are the chili verde and the pollo fundito!  yumm!  the chili verde is slow roasted pork smothered with green chili...so good!  the pollo fundito is a chicken burrito smothered in queso blanco and run under the broiler...double yumm.  it's a bit kitchy, but the service is consistent, the food fresh and tasty, and the whole el encanto story is charming.  when you are in cave creek, go, no run to el encanto and don't forget the margaritas...so good!</b_review>
<b_review>we like this restaurant more for the atmosphere. it's fun to bring out of town guests or large parties because you can sit outside by a pond with ducks. it has an old hacienda feel to it which is nice for people not familiar with the arizona desert. there is also a mariachi band that walks from table to table which adds to the ambiance. the food is pretty good but not the best mexican food i have had. (i have had better mexican at carolina's) it's good enough though if you want to go somewhere romantic or fun for a large group. the service is always pretty decent as well. we're fans!</b_review>

<text>this place is so confusing even yelpers can't figure out where to place a review for it... http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-pino-phoenix#hrid:z2znufqknwpi95c38cz0aq/query:cafepino  you enter and i'm still trying to figure out if you have to order at the counter and then if you want to order more from the high presure service then you can order from the table..  came hear cause "lightbulb" the movie i worked on played and won best picture at the phx film fest! and this looked like a great meeting place...  and every time someone met us here... they would sit down and go oh i order up there?  one of the worst salads i've ever had i ordered it twice thinking it was a fluke... its just bad...   tuna melt much better at paradise...  vegie sandwich 13$! i saw no safron on there... theres no reason for this...  i want to love this place, love the decor and the owner did seem nice but the rest of the staff seemed pushy...  grrr...i will come back and hope that its food matches its location and decore...</text>
<u_review>ok kona popped my sushi cherry........and it was pretty good.....  the las vegas rolls! and there crunchy crab was good and the eel thingy....  but i've heard there's lots better and i'm just inexperienced....so until i've slept around i'm giving it 4 stars...</u_review>
<u_review>visited 9/15/07  we went here because duck and decanter was closed...  yes it reminded me of a greek chipotle to...  had the chicken wraps they where ok. ate for dinner would have been better as lunch...  interesting mix of greek and salsa...  i wish the plate was as nice as the resturant..the paper plate thing...  oh the green tea was good.</u_review>
<u_review>g00d motr re virfeew when i sober up....   ok long story i found out this bar/food is now called c4 read the more sobered up review there...  vp</u_review>
<u_review>big scary family dinner thing here... 9 of us i think? ... long table impossible to talk to each other.... it was perfect!....  no really .... it was good for the family thing...good food i think... they had wine.. doobys himself really nice...   head was spinning from odd family moment... but remember it enough that i would want to go back... there was some sort of little relish i had with the bread stuff that was excellent...  sorry my review is not more help full... i'll have to go back and investigate...</u_review>
<b_review>ok place.  not enough cheese on the pizza, crust is ok, but i like the sauce a lot.  i rather have pizzeria bianco</b_review>
<b_review>i really do love cafepino.   the servic e for one, is excellent. the owner, a polite frechman, is always there to greet his customers and to oversee his business, which in this economy is the watermark of a good business owner. he is also very helpful when it comes to menu decisions. the wait staff, however, is a little lackluster. they simply bring your food, and then leave, and make little to no conversation at all. i've never had complications/bad experience at cafepino, and the only problem is perhaps their waitstaff.   the food is excellent. a little pricey, but good nonetheless. usually while i'm there, i get this creamy tomato sauce penne pasta dish- i can't remeber exactly what it's called, the ceasar salad- which is fresh, crispy, cold and has the right balance of cheese/lettuce/dressing, or the pizzas, which are best when they are cooked crispy!   the atmosphere is cozy but modern, and is a good place for date night, or simply just a night out.   if you're willing to pay a tad more for some good food, then cafepino is worth it!</b_review>
<b_review>food was okay, but staff is rude. still trying to figure out how i was charged $15 for what should have been $8.95 as lunch special. a bowl of mediocre pasta for $15? definitely not worth it.</b_review>
<b_review>cafe pino is the sort of place i am totally mixed on. i wanted to love it - cute, conveniently near the movie theater, serves late, broad, well priced wine list. but, my experience here was odd at best.   went with one of my friends, meredith g., after a movie. we were never told whether to order at the counter or if we would be waited on, and we basically stood around for a while. once we ordered, it took a while for the food to be delivered, which was odd b/c we were about the only people there. also, the owner kept staring at us and coming by every two seconds to ask if we were "ok." this quickly went from friendly to down right annoying.  the pizza and salad we shared was tasty, but the service was a hassle overall.</b_review>

<text>i'm sad to say that the place has gone very much downhill since their move to a bigger location. i've given them a few chances hoping it was just growing pains, but it's taken way too long to get back on their game.  i am part of a regular group that used to go here every friday morning. we always sat on the patio of the old place and always got the best service. super friendly, fast coffee refills--they were just on.  after they moved across the street, they began to make it clear that they would not be accommodating our group. they wouldn't set up a table for us and tried to shove us into individual booths, even when there were only 5 or 6 of us. they have a "back room" with larger tables that they wouldn't open at the time we got there (~6:00am) claiming staffing issues. they finally and begrudgingly let us back there along with several other larger groups facing a similar circumstance; we were basically ignored. they might has well just told us to our faces that they would not be serving us as a group and saved us all the trouble.  don't read between the lines here--we are not a loud, annoying, or demanding group. we are just some guys that like to get together at breakfast.  sadly, our concerns were not heard or passed on to anyone who cared, so i doubt we will ever be back. we've since moved on to places that will gladly accept our business.</text>
<u_review>yuck, really?  i never go to best buy, but i went over the weekend to try some laptop comparison shopping with my wife. i just wanted to her try different models and see which ones she liked.  first, what are you doing at the door, guy standing at the door? are you a receipt checker? i can't stand that kind of gestapo b.s. if you are a greeter, and you did greet us, why are you standing at a podium, richard dawson?  onward. they have the laptops arranged by brand... kind of? there are a couple laptops of each brand, but then they have endcaps of laptops or no known reason, and a whole row of "student" laptops for which the criteria is anyone's guess. the "apple" section is also segregated 20 feet away with curtains, as if to prevent an infiltration of filth from the windows pcs.   my wife managed to inspect a couple of the laptops for at least 30 seconds before being jostled aside by an associate trying to get into a storage cage. i marveled at the signs advertising the geek squad service of essentially turning on your laptop and uninstalling a couple unwanted apps for like $100. how many people have been suckered into this, i wonder.  then... there is a cox cable guy roaming around? why am i being accosted by a third-party vendor inside of best buy?</u_review>
<u_review>this little place does a great job pumping out fresh chinese food. it won't really blow you through the wall into the avis rental office next door, but it's above average. thus far we've tried several of the chicken and veggie dishes--they are all very good. the garlic chicken and mongolian chicken are favorites. pei wok makes everything fresh to order. there are a few clean, small tables you could sit at to eat (i think two two-tops and one four-top), but i always get it to go.  there are smaller lunch combos for a very cheap prices--cheaper even than going to panda express which is relative garbage. for dinner, you can get a "large" which is just white rice and entree, or you can get the "combo" which is fried rice, entree, egg roll, and cream cheese wontons. look, maybe a better semantic strategy was in order, but they do what they can.  the guys running the joint are also very nice and friendly. they always banter with me about my tattoos, the weather, or anything else that comes up.</u_review>
<u_review>two key points:  1) it's new, so, it's still mostly clean and the grease traps haven't reached critical mass yet.  2) if you're headed toward tucson on i-10 east, this is really the last convenient place to get off before you get to casa grande exit 195 which is like a billion miles away. so if you're hungry get off now.  that is all.</u_review>
<u_review>this is a good location, in terms of freshness. always a good selection of salad junk, and the soups are good. avoid their pre-compiled salads, as they basically negate any healthy benefit you might get from eating there. i don't know what's up with the pasta, though -- they've got the worse pasta i've ever tasted. they would do better just to open some cans of franco-american.  on another downside, this place is kind of ludicrously priced when you think about it. $3 for a drink? it's not a movie theater, man. they do have a discount if you have a phoenix zoo membership, so bring your card.</u_review>
<b_review>was not a fan... our server looked like she hadn't bathed in a few days and kept going behind the hostess stand to look through her purse for some axe body spray. one of the other servers was eating french fries off of another employees plate that was sitting at a small bar area. got the hamburger because nothing else looked promising at all. it would've been better if i just went to mcdonalds. this was my first time going there, and i will not be returning.</b_review>
<b_review>i guess i do not agree with the majority.  i found the food to be average at best.  and the prices seemed high for the quality of food.  all in all, i would have been happier at a coco's or denny's.  i will head a little south to peoria and go to brother's.</b_review>
<b_review>mediocre at best, slight step up from denny's. the biscuits were made from bisquick , there was no sausage in the anemic gravy and the chicken fried steak was just breaded hamburger. the apple danish was good though.</b_review>
<b_review>4.5 stars.   the man and i decided that since these are our last two days in arizona, we needed to try as many non-chain places as possible. also, since all of our kitchen is packed in boxes, we needed some breakfast food this morning. yelp to the rescue and cue..mike & rhondas!  wow. this place definitely lived up to the hype. you know you've found a keeper when they have advertisements around the boarder of the menu. i got a build-your-own omelette with egg whites only (yesssss!!), peppers, onions, ham, and pepperjack cheese. it came with hashbrowns and i ordered fruit instead of breads. no extra charge! the man ordered "the hungry man" meal which came with 3 eggs, 2 sausage patties, hashbrowns, and three huge biscuts with gravy...the size of your head!!   the battle between my man and the hungry man ended in a doggie bag to take home.. neither of us could finish our meals. we brought home what could easily be a third meal.  friendly, ridiculously fast service. i only wish i had found this place 2 years ago when i first moved here, rather than 2 days before i was leaving!!</b_review>

<text>this place was ruff on my stomach, i got the yellow curry here.  i heard about this place on yelp because me and my friend wanted some chinese food.    well the place is clean and my friend said that his dish (orange chicken) was just ok,  after i was done eating i felt my stomach screaming 'what did you do to me, i have always been your friend'.    there is also a pei wei in the same area and i wish we just went to them because it is a bit better quality then this place.  i even had it a couple hours later after the meal cold, and i dont even know why i just felt like giving it another shot, but nope it was still making my insides hurt.    recommendation: i would try somewhere else unless you hate your stomach,and if you do, try something else then the curry.</text>
<u_review>i come here for the cool vibe and the hipster art that is hanging and changes every 2 or so months.  the more important reason i come here is for the burgers and sandwiches that they have.  the menu has a wide range of stuff that is quite the crowed pleaser.  i have never left unsatisfied with my meal and the wait staff is really attentive and not pushy.  you feel relaxed and happy, which is the way i like to enjoy my meal.  the bar is actually really cool, i have yet to drink at it but it always looks like its poppin' so it cant be that bad.    its also affordable compared to some of the other restaurants located in the scottsdale area.  recommendation:  for a cool, young, hip, and classy place, go here, and for a great meal with 2-6 people.</u_review>
<u_review>i came to this place and thought 'wow, a lot of restaurants and bars in phoenix are in houses'.  it is a cool bar that has a good list of beer so your bound to like something on the menu.    they have a music area that is pretty good and good sounding, and looks like a living room.    defiantly the hip, art, and indie people go to this bar, but you don't have to be any of those to enjoy the place.  recommendation: a good place to stop by for you first beer of your night out and to see a band that's not to popular yet.</u_review>
<u_review>if your looking for some good mediterranean food i would go here.  they give you a bang for your buck, a chicken kabob platter comes with salad, hummus, and 4 pieces of pita that is amazingly delicious.   i will definitely come back for a meal to go.  i would even suggest ordering before you go because it takes a bit of time to cook so you know.   recommendation: to anyone on mill not going to the bars and is hungry and in the mood for some pretty damn good hummus.</u_review>
<u_review>this place is really good and close to campus.  they moved in after papa johns closed and i heard from either a magazine or some sort of food magazine that said to stop in.     the thing about the taco shop is that they have really good burritos and all sorts of great mexican delights that will fill you up and leave you satisfied.  there menu is diverse enough to give anyone something to munch on.  it is a step up from filibertos or taco bell and  is very different tasking then the chipotle burrito.  this is where i must say if you have the craving of chipotle your obviously going to go there, but switch it up one time.    it is conveniently located to asu campus and they have amazing salsa and chips.  i have dreams about there red salsa now, it haunts me with its good taste.  recommendation: for people want a taste other-than chipotle , making the change, for a more authentic mexican meal for its pricing, taste and red salsa.</u_review>
<b_review>i love this place. it's not as cheap as panda express, but that's the point.   if you want a good, fast chinese food experience, eat here.  if you want to get some starbucks before or after, this is a good place too.  if you're lonely, write more yelp reviews.  please take some time out of your day to try some chinese that's not poured out of a semi truck shipped from california(if not further).</b_review>
<b_review>we went here last night for the first time and really liked it! my boyfriend got the orange chicken, and i had the walnut shrimp. both meals were very flavorful, cooked well, were great portions, and also reheated nicely the next day. for some reason i really liked their fortune cookies too. i know it sounds like an odd thing to mention but i did! i usually never eat them but their fortune cookies had a homemade taste to them! we will absolutely be going back!</b_review>
<b_review>ate there tonight. don't love chinese but they have thai stuff. can't say i loved the foodt. but its very clean. food is very fresh. and you get the impression that they do their thing with more care than most places. if you like chinese you should be very happy.</b_review>
<b_review>tott's use to be one of my favorite chinese food restaurants, my co-workers and i would go at least once a week. i went there last night when the owner wasn't working and received the worst customer service i have received in a long time. they messed up my order multiple times and told me i was wrong when i clearly wasn't. they gave me an attitude when i was attempting to be polite and didn't listen to me. worst of all this was a takeout order and i had to drive there twice and then deal with their rude employees. even the cook gave me an attitude. i have never received less than perfect customer service when the owner was there, but i am sad to say that me and my co-workers will never return to tott's again. best of all, when i got home they did not give me any soy sauce, sweet & sour sauce or pot sticker's sauce which i had asked for extra of each one on both trips... and i had just given them 50 dollars of my business...</b_review>

<text>mediocre at best. not too tasty. salsa blah, beans and rice too salty. only thing i feel confident in recommending is the mexican pizza app w/ chicken. big enough to share.  other than that, the price is too expensive for the food served.</text>
<u_review>the only reason i go to bashas is for the convenience. first of all make sure you have some extra time to run an errand there since you will be waiting in the checkout line. the checkout clerks are maybe a little outdated like the store itself. oh and make sure you check expiration dates on the products. i bought some crackers for work and they were 6 months past the expiration date. don't forget your bashas card if you have one, they won't give you a courtesy swipe. 1 star because i can't give 0.</u_review>
<u_review>i took my girlfriend to donovan's for her birthday and was really looking forward to one of the better steakhouses in phoenix. the restaurant has that dark old school steakhouse ambiance that i love. we had a reservation, which i would recommend, and were seated right away.   we ordered a couple drinks and an appetizer (bacon wrapped scallops). true to form for a good steakhouse my martini was perfect with blue cheese olives. the scallops were huge with the crispy bacon and i believe fried spinach. delicious! the start of our night was awesome. the wait staff gave us all the time we wanted to order our entrees.   we ordered our entrees and by this time my martini was gone. i was kinda surprised they didn't ask if i wanted another one. needless to say i would have if they asked, but i didn't order one. i ordered the peppercorn filet and my girlfriend ordered the petite filet. mine was perfect, but i was a little shocked by my girlfriends. the cut of filet was somewhat hacked and the temp medium rare was definitely medium+. we had to send it back because it was way too chewy. the staff had no problem getting her another one. the second filet was night and day to the first. i understand that mistakes happen, but this one was way too obvious. should have been caught at the pass.   we were really let down by donovan's. i guess when you go to a nice place you expect perfection. she only had a couple bites of her new filet (which was really good), but she had filled up on my filet and bread. the filet issue and attention to detail with our drinks was just not what we were expecting with a high end restaurant like donovan's. still searching for our gibson's steakhouse in phoenix.</u_review>
<u_review>i have been frequenting gas stations for many years now and i have seen my fair share of dumps. i can't vouch for the quality of gas other than my car hasn't had fuel filter issues, but i can say the service there sucks. their cc swipe on the pumps weren't working and i had to go in, to which i found two clerks chewing gum and leaning on the back wall behind the counter. i had to ask for them to ring me up. you would have thought that i asked them to change my tire. i know working at a gas station probably isn't their dream job, but it is their job at least for a little bit.</u_review>
<u_review>the food was great. i think what turned me off on this place is that it ends up being a club. not that i am against clubs, but when you have food like this maybe you should be a nice restaurant and bar. the club part of this place was definitely lacking. i think the canteen would be better off focusing on the food and bar side of the business rather than the club. wait staff was sub par and the noise was beyond loud. great place to go if you don't plan on talking.</u_review>
<b_review>pretty darn average.  went tonight.  interesting decor but the food was blah, and boring with a capital b.  i only give it 3 stars because it has been there forever and people seem to like it.  its the usual enchilada with those damn rice and beans with cheese crap all over again ("watch out the plates are hot from the microwave")   ....zzz, wake me when its over.  got some enchilada thing stuffed with chicken and mashed potatoes, sounded good but it was dull and uninspiring.  the chips and salsa were nice and warm but the chips were like baked and while it may be better for you, it didn't taste better.  service was competent.  salsa = boring, cilantroesque, no kick at all.    pepsi products = yikes and no pepsi is not ok, i wanted a coke!  why do servers always say "is pepsi ok?" when they don't have coke anyways, where did that originate from?  do you learn that response in servers school?  won't rush back anytime soon.  maybe i should order something else if there is ever a next time?  i can still taste the cilantro from the so called salsa.  really this is not very good food.   update: cilantro taste lingers the next day, much extra toothbrushing required.  i have put ajo al's in its place with 2 stars.  they can do better.  for $35 with tip i should have had a better meal.</b_review>
<b_review>i went with my co-workers today and i had a chicken taco salad. the service was fast enough for the place being full, the price was average, there was plenty of parking, and i had a great experience. i'd go again.</b_review>
<b_review>i have been in the industry for years and i really don't like giving reviews like this. i really enjoy the food and have been here many times over the years, but the service i received tonight was bad and it was only a to-go order. i understand the restaurant was very busy for a thursday night, but i tried calling four times and never got an answer. when i informed the manager who took my order once i arrived he just shrugged and said 'it's busy'. the food came out in a timely manner. when i arrived back to collect my order, there was no hostess/host at the front door for at least three minutes. once i was greeted, the service was very impersonal. i am just disappointed with my experience and i am glad i took the food to-go. i really enjoy the food here, and i really hope that this review doesn't fall on deaf ears. service really needs to improve, even on unusually busy nights.</b_review>
<b_review>had lunch there yesterday.  the service was excellent but the food was not that great.  i had a cheese enchilada & a taco.  the enchilada was black from the chili sitting too long in the warmer and the taco was below par.  i ate it because i was so hungry but i should have sent it back.  i could have had a microwave dinner & done better.  will not repeat that mistake again.                                      arizonabrad</b_review>

<text>went today. not very busy and still took about 15 mins to get 2 burgers and a shake. the reason is because our burgers were done but they were doing training so our burgers sat there while the one server went through all of the procedure to adding pickles, lettuce etc, all the garnishments. that alone took a good 5 mins. meanwhile our burger sat there getting cold. also the fries.  then they called us up, i alreayd knew it was going to be cold because we saw how long it had been sitting out with 2 employees hovering over it.  burgers were cold, fries were cold. had to send it all back. unreal!!!!  i have been to joes at least 20x since its in our neighborhood and our last 5 experiences have been horrible.  so disappointing. this place used to be great!</text>
<u_review>i love wings as much as anyone but this place loses me with their over preparation of its wings. every sauce seemed to be loaded with thick syrupy candy. tasting any chicken is an afterthought with these wings, its all about the sauces. which to me, are way too sugary.  tried 5 different flavors, the jalapeno one was by far the most tolerable.  the atmosphere is sports bar and the acoustics of the building could not be worse. a guy screams because of a touchdown on the other side of the bar and it will send shocks up your spine as you sit on the most uncomfortable sold wood booth seat ever.  pass.</u_review>
<u_review>some of the most bland indian food in town.   i eat indian about once a week and would consider myself an "indian buffet guru". this buffet is more than sub par with very awkward stand right by the table and stare at you type service.   bad. pass. if you want better in this area try guru palace. but even still that place is not amazing either.</u_review>
<u_review>i was not only blown away by how uninterested the girl was that was teaching this "cookie baking class" this novermber but how rude she was to the only male that was in the class with us!  it was like she was extremely upset that a man decided to take the class and treated him rudely the entire time. i was bothered by it the entire time. not only was i bothered by it but myself and 3 other girls all told him after the class that he should ask for his money back. and he should.  i would not recommend the sweet basil classes or cooking school to anyone that is looking for a pleasurable experience as the blonde lady who teaches the classes (i believe her name was melissa) seems absolutely miserable and unhappy with her job.  hopefully the owner reads this and takes note.</u_review>
<u_review>subpar and bland cupcakes. much better can be had within 2 miles of this place. keep looking.  $3.75 or a single cupcake!?!? lol  try the coffee shop or designer cakes</u_review>
<b_review>came here for breakfast, but wish we came here for lunch since i'm more of a lunch person.  anyway.  the best dish was definitely the belgium waffles & strawberries!  i also tried the farm huevos which was scrambled eggs mixed with salsa and ham with a side of beans (not a big fan of beans).  it came with tortilla chips which i liked, but the eggs itself were simply okay.  however, i did love the decor!  the place is literally on a farm.  we sat outside near the big tree (beautiful) and had a nice view while eating.  don't forget to use their restrooms. it's pretty cool (i know, weird to write a review about restrooms) because it looks like a spaceship inside.  you'll see a flatscreen tv with a puppet space movie playing, and barbie dolls in space capsules in the walls.  yup.</b_review>
<b_review>good food but nothing to drive 20 miles for.  guy fieri helped bring a lot of business here and now their prices show it.  i dropped $17 on a burger, fries and chocolate shake.  not bad for once a year but i can think of better ways to spend nearly $20 on a meal.  this is a small establishment with walk-up ordering and call your number when finished just in case anyone was expecting something more fancy.    don't leave without getting the garlic fries.  practically worth the entire meal itself.</b_review>
<b_review>stick to breakfast or brunch for this place. dinner ain't that great. had veggie pizza....no flavor or zest to it...at least it was not greasy. also sample the bbq pork...meh at best. i wish they should have used a better sauce. though the fried zucchini and the ginger ale was good. seriously sticking to breaky.</b_review>
<b_review>food not worth the wait. stood in line for 50 minutes just to order. saw the (presumably) owner headed out for the day stop and chat with some people in front of us in line. mentioned just how busy they have been. saw the obviously long line and didn't do anything to address the situation. yep, the entire time only one of their two order windows was open. one.  i guess i'm the sucker and the joke's on me.</b_review>

<text>delicious burger. great prices. i especially like that i can order my burger protein style...you know, so i don't feel as guilty when i eat my sweet potato fries. that's right, you heard me. sweet potato fries.   i swear this is the best intersection in tempe. you have habit, mac's, hoodlums, changing hands, sbux,, trader joe's and pei wei, and wildflower. what else do you need.</text>
<u_review>great merch. great prices.   although..it's a bit sketchy getting out of the parking lot. you have to back up in a major street. is there anywhere else to park?</u_review>
<u_review>great music. delicious food. amazing customer service. our server was jeremy, he was so helpful when selecting menu items and super friendly. this place is awesome! can't wait to go back with friends.</u_review>
<u_review>okay, first off let me say that i am going to dream about those refeshing wine coolers until i can make it back to phoenix. service was great. the music and environment were right up my alley. i had the burrata and olive oil appetizer and some pizza with dates and augula. everything was fantastic!   i believe this is by the same restaurant group that provided us with postino. with that being said, you should already know that you will love this place.</u_review>
<u_review>$5 for a ticket mon-thurs before 6pm. can't beat that. i believe the movie has to have been out for at least a week, so if you can wait it's a great deal. just make sure you buy something from concession because that's how movie theaters make their money. it doesn't come from movie tickets.</u_review>
<b_review>ordered chicken club, lots of avocado which i loved. husband ordered double burger, he liked it but didn't rave about it. fries were so/so. his golden and crunchy, mine limp and kinda soggy- i'll give it another shot before deciding if i like this place or not.</b_review>
<b_review>good, but not incredible, burgers.  can't beat the prices.  basic burger joint.    our favorite thing about this place is the patio.    clean, friendly staff, good burgers</b_review>
<b_review>2 stars because the burgers are average (would be 3 stars) but the price for what you get is high (minus 1star).   with that said, i probably should go back just to see. but first impressions are usually what stick.</b_review>
<b_review>breaking the habit, tonight by the rue  today i went to habit, i thought it was good dag nab it, didn't even have to stab it, like my name was jed clampit.  condements bar, no need to walk far, ketchup not in a jar, i drive a jeep not a car.  this place used to be totts, favorite applesauce is motts, don't listen to any robots, stop trying to connect the dots.  this place gets crowded by noon, get there early on your broom, i'll let you feed me with a spoon, dating me is your impending doom.   all in all i prefer in and out, i'm right here no need to shout, after i give you a hickey do not pout, when i'm through there'll be no doubt.   slam it!!!</b_review>

<text>the only good thing about this place was the excellent tasting and unique cocktails.  the buck stops there.  i came here last night with a group of ten and although they don't take reservations they ended up reserving a large table for us, which was pretty nice of them.  all the cocktails i tried were unique and tasty but overpriced.  the sushi was really bland and nothing better then ra.  i was hesitant to try the lobster ceviche because of the whopping $21 price tag, but i figured it would be awesome and a generous portion.  when the ceviche arrived it had  three measly lettuce cups and virtually no lobster at all; the few tiny pieces of lobster i did find were tasteless.  i was so disappointed, and actually pretty pissed.  what a scam and ripoff.  i'm not a cheap person but that was just plain robbery.  i didn't even eat a full cup and didn't touch the rest; when the waitress was within earshot i commented how i didn't like the dish, but she never said a word.  i work in the food industry and you should be able to tell when a dish isn't being eaten because the customer doesn't enjoy it.    our waitress was pretty attentive and friendly but she wasn't present very often.  the whole "no split checks" thing is bs!  it is not hard to split checks and unless they hand write all orders, the p.o.s system is clearly able to do it.  forcing groups to share one tab isn't convenient for anyone, including the server, and it just pisses people off.  also the booths are too low for the tables are feel really awkward; good thing we were the first to arrive and got to nab the chairs!    total bill was $659.00 for ten people.  this place is not worth that type of money at all.  such an utter disappointment.</text>
<u_review>i have been using dr. molina for a few years now and can't say enough great things about her and her staff.  we all know how traumatizing a vet visit can be for both animal and human; it's great to be able to have my animals taken care of in an environment they feel comfortable in.  i find the prices to be lower than the average vet office as well.  i have referred them to many friends and i do the same for all of you.  london says hi jeanette</u_review>
<u_review>i love this place so much!  love getting the prime rib and king crab leg combo.  this is the place my fiance and i go when we really want to have a european type dining experience (i.e no rush, 2 hour laid back meal).  service is always great, aside from the one time we had a drunk server:)  they could have a bigger wine list, but i always find something i like.  i highly recommend coming here for date night.</u_review>
<u_review>i have been to shotgun betty's a few times over the years and there is always something about it that makes me want to come back.  i'm not into women, but the girls here are good looking and wear very little.  they also take turns dancing on the poles while grotesque old perverted men slip dollars into their garters; i couldn't deal with that, so kudos ladies!  service is kind of hit or miss, as i've had both friendly and bitchy experiences with the staff.  bottom line is that the music here is generally pretty great and the atmosphere is always lively.  this place is also great for single women since there are tons of men that flock here to watch half naked dancers.</u_review>
<u_review>i think this place has pros and cons.  i like the large selection of organic food but i feel they are a tinge overpriced.  i was very pleased with the seafood and meat selections!  there is a pretty decent beer and wine selection here; nothing really stood out but i did find hop box there which was awesome.  the store is kinda small so you're running into people pretty often but i think it's a pretty lovely store altogether.</u_review>
<b_review>i really recommend this place, but unless the food is great, i don't hand out four stars and above. go for the atmosphere, the atmosphere is probably the best i've experienced in all of phoenix so far.  the great thing about this place is the atmosphere. it's hip, and modern with an asian influence.  the best thing about this haunt is the staff. we sat at the bar, and the manager, the bartenders and most of the rest of the staff circling about were friendly and very helpful. i drink shoot loads of water, i can get through more than 5 glasses in one meal. not once was my water glass empty. she just kept filling it up. also we wanted to watch the game (sunday football) and turn on the closed captioning, they spent a good 15 minutes figuring it out, just for us. awesome people, plus they were chatty but not intrusive.  the second best thing is the bartender. her cocktails, we had a geisha a go go and kimono dragon. the kimono dragon was great (being sweet) while the geisha a go go was not as sweet, more alcoholic and tasted like watermelons as it should.  unfortunately, the food wasn't the best. i had the vegetable udon. the flavor was good, but it was so salty. i have to agree with another yelper that they use way too much soy sauce. we also had a variety of sushi's. we had sashimi and some other raw fishes and no one got sick, a big plus in the valley. the flavor was ok, but it didn't leave my mouth watering. we had some spicy tuna, some sashimi, some fish eggs, and this and that.  i wouldn't go hunt this place down and make it a place to go to when i'm wanting some good food, but if i'm totally down on the atmosphere. it's really somewhere i'd go and just sit around for two hours or so. the food isn't great, but the great atmosphere and the staff is well worth the bill easily racked up. lastly, we had the chocolate cake, it was definitely chocolatey and relatively moist.  ... i lo</b_review>
<b_review>dont get me wrong, i love stingray's menu but this location has the absolute worst service.  i went here for my bachelorette dinner. they sat us on the patio and completely forgot about us for about 20 mins. we asked several different servers that came to see if we were ok for water, full dining sets, etc. and none of them ever came back. it wasnt until i was seen by one of the waitresses eating my sushi w/ my fingers that they actual brought me a plate and chopsticks ( we asked 4 different girls for it over the hour ).   i'll be sticking to the biltmore location.</b_review>
<b_review>sushi places are a dime a dozen in this town, and in my mission to try them all, i met a friend at stingray for happy hour.  the food was decent.  i've certainly had better.  the las vegas roll was a little heavy on the rice and tempura.  the drinks were exceptionally good.  i had the asian blonde, which is lychee and champagne, can't go wrong there.  my friend's drink was something with raspberries and rose water.  it was amazing.  all that being said, the service was awful.  once our food was delivered our waitress disappeared.  i got one refill on my water, and considering that i drink water like its going out of style, this is completely unacceptable.  my empty glass sat on the edge of the table for the remainder of dinner.  once we were done eating, we couldn't get the bill, as our waitress was still missing.  some 20+ minutes after we were completely done eating she appeared again, and we requested the bill.  once the bill arrived, it took the waitress an additional 15 to 20 minutes to come pick it up.  it was taking so long that i actually held the bill and credit cards up and out past the edge of the table, hoping someone passing by would offer to take it, or atleast offer to send our waitress over. busboys went by, the hostess went by several times, other waitresses went by,  the manager even went by, and they all pretended like they didn't see me holding the bill.  i've never had such a difficult time trying to get someone to take my money; it was truly infuriating.  stingray is definitely getting crossed off my list.  i don't have time for bad service.</b_review>
<b_review>supreme quality, but extreme pricing. a great place for lunch, happy hour, or to make a good impression.   love the ambiance, ideal for a date, business meeting, or any sort of good impression, and the staff is top notch too.  the sushi, especially sashimi, is high grade. amazingly fresh stuff, and the selection is varied with different types. for a truly special occasion try the lobster dynamite-- it might have been one of the best seafood dishes i have ever tasted.   the cocktail menu is impressive, but the martinis can be a bit strong.   dinner pricing is high, but nothing unusual for the marketplace, and portions are small, but like i said before you're paying for the quality and atmosphere.</b_review>

<text>scale of 1-10 (multiple visits): 10 food 9 *drinks* 8 service 9 atmosphere 7 value  my original review for here was a "meh, mediocre".  since then, there have been some menu adjustments, i've explored more of the menu, and i've generally gotten my head out of my ass.  the place is still pricey if you're looking for affordable and don't know what to order.  if that is the case, then let me direct you to the green papaya salad (w/ shrimp or tofu), the sugar cane pork, or the spicy wontons.  if available when you're there, the pesto edamame and the pad thai are also excellent ways to not break the bank.  (the pad thai can even leave leftovers if you're not super hungry.)  the bacon-wrapped _____ are also delicious, as is pretty much anything in the "fried" section.  i know a number of people that don't like the hong kong flat rice, but they're just silly, because i think it's great.  the service is friendly and very well informed, though there are occasional timing issues.  that's totally okay though, because their pours seem generous, making the somewhat-steep cocktail prices not really that bad after all.  all in all i admit that i was wrong giving sens a (weak) 3-stars last year.  i should have given it a (strong) 4-stars all along.</text>
<u_review>scale of 1-10 (multiple visits): 8 food 8 service 8 atmosphere 8 value  mmmm tasty....  just don't show up late because they let their flavored croissant offerings thin out significantly as lunch approaches.</u_review>
<u_review>scale of 1-10 (multiple visits): 10 food 9 *drinks* 10 service 9 atmosphere 7 value  1) tear crostini in half. 2) slather on paradise valley butter.  (we're talkin' a solid 2 millimeters.) 3) smoosh on some honeycomb honey. 4) gingerly place a cashew on each expected bite. 5) place in mouth and take 3-4 chews. 6) bite into a small radish. 7) close eyes and let life melt away into ecstasy.  their food doesn't have names, it just lists the components.  so now you can find that one.  that dish earns fnb a 6th star: *  but they change up their menu constantly, because they only serve what's seasonal and available from local farmers.  so get it while you can.  unless by the grace of god it's there forever.  but not to be all one-tracky, because their other stuff is good too.  i particularly enjoyed the grilled broccoli w/ aioli, and also like their braised leeks.  they serve some wonderful az wines, and their cranberry presbyterian was good, though i would have liked a little extra splash of alcyhol in it.  they also have good dessert - but honestly i'd go down the street to lee's alcohol ice cream for that.  make sure to notice the floor of the place.  it's super cool.  i totally want to do that in my kitchen!  okay, let me think back to those 7 steps of bliss again.....</u_review>
<u_review>scale of 1-10 (multiple visits): 7 food 7 service 8 atmosphere 6 value  the food is hit or miss, some mini-burgers are great, some are meh; and the sweet potato fries don't even come close to places like delux.  the atmosphere is on the verge of trying too hard to look modern-chic, but does barely manage to stay legit and come across as cool - barely. the service (when i've been there - realizing that this is the most variable element of a place) wasn't timed well and didn't get stuff right.  i realize that it can easily be the kitchen's fault instead of the server's, but even in that case it's still the server's place to check the food before bringing it out - especially considering that it wasn't a busy night.</u_review>
<u_review>scale of 1-10 (single visit): 8 drinks 8 service 5 atmosphere 7 value  lola offers pretty good stuff, but it's loud as hell and feels a little chaotic, so avoid the mistake of setting up a meeting here unless it's nice enough to sit outside.</u_review>
<b_review>a nice variety of asian plates are offered in this place. not the best ones i have tried in all categories but if you want variety this is a good place.</b_review>
<b_review>dinner at sens was, hands-down, one of the best meal-experiences we've had here in phoenix. four of us (2 couples) made reservations at sens for 6:30 on a saturday night. it was a good thing we had reservations, because shortly thereafter, the place was packed.   sens is not a place to grab a quick bite; rather, this is the place to go to use all of your senses (get it?) - taste, smell, see, hear ... the music was great, the lighting was nice, and the food was amazing.   we started off with some drinks. i was intrigued by their infused shochu ( a japanese vodka). to start, i tried the lychee-infused shochu with club soda. my friend also enjoyed the lychee shochu but with club soda and a splash of cranberry juice, while her husband tried the logan shochu chilled and straight up. my daring husband opted for the chili-infused shochu, which was incredibly spicy. not long thereafter, the waitress asked if he wanted it made into a martini, so he chose the "hot and dirty" (which was like a dirty martini, but made with the hot chili shochu). later, i tried the ginger-infused shochu and the lemongrass-infused shochu. great drinks!   to eat, we dined like royalty on the following dishes:  la nho, lemongrass marinated beef wrapped in grape leaves.  volcano flamed, thinly sliced beef seared on hot stone. the beef actually comes to the table raw, and you literally cook it for 40 seconds per side on a hot stone. very cool.  shu mai, wasabi pork and shrimp dumplings. very tasty, with a kick!  papaya mango salad with shrimp in a lime vinegarette.  wasabi soy chicken breast, marinated and served with rock salt wasabi.  lemongrass soy chicken breast - this was probably my favorite dish!  spicy wonton filled with sauteed chicken and pepperjack cheese.  red curry tofu - we ordered a side of steamed rice, which you really have to do in order to enjoy all of the amazing sauce in this claypot dish.  and, finally, quail seasoned with aromatic rock salt.  i would order everything all over again. i loved that we got to try a little bit of everything, and we had such a fun time eating, chatting, drinking ... it was hard to leave!   on a side note, i had the opportunity to chat with owner/executive chef johnny chu about the creation of sens vs what's happening over at the restaurant-formerly-known-as-fate. johnny has taken the old fate menu and infused it into the sens lunch menu. he's also not involved with what used to be fate (they are now calling it 905), so if you loved the old fate, you need to find your way over to sens!</b_review>
<b_review>it is time i give credit, where credit is due.  sens is a 5 star dining establishment.  hands down.  if you don't think so we may have to go toe to toe.  bacon wrapped dates=amazing!  soup gyoza=addicting!  green papaya spring rolls=refreshing!  panko shrimp=guilty pleasure!  hot & sour soup=well, hot!  sizzling shrimp plate=t.a.s.t.y.  really, it's not just the food.  the bartenders/servers have always been super attentive, personable, and know the food.  the atmosphere on a busier night with the door rolled up and perfect weather.  priceless experience.  i know everyone is always talking about how everyone is on johnny's nuts, but come on, the dude is a super nice guy and knows how to put some damned tasty food together.</b_review>
<b_review>me:    of course i want to go to an asian topless bar.  are you feeling ok ash...i thought you hated topless bars?  and asian nonetheless....i never expected that from you!  ash:    shut up...i said asian tapas bar! not topless.  me: damn!  darn my luck...a guy never gets to have any fun!!!   it wasn't what i expected...but i was not disappointed.  it was great.  the place was hip.  the staff was friendly.  the food was incredible.  the bill...well the bill was a bit high.  but overall it was a great experience.    we started snapping pics through dinner.  this motivated the exec chef and owner lady to come sit next to us at the bar.  i felt kind of bad for drawing attention because the owner lady became very controlling with the staff and i was a bit uncomfortable for them.  but overall...i would say this place is aw aw awesome.  try it. have a cocktail.  eat some tapas. have some fun. don't expect anyone to be topless though :-(</b_review>

<text>dang!  i wish i had seen the reviews prior to visiting this restaurant but...it was not my choice, actually.  what completely freaked me out was that the bill was $85.00!  $85.00 for a meal for two!  for mexican food!?  excuse me!!!???  the atmosphere was nice, the waitstaff was average, and the food was sub-par.  actually, the fish tacos were the worst i have tasted but my date loved the carnitas.  the pitchers of margaritas are largely filled with ice.  and everything is waaay overpriced for the flavor and quality of the food.  i won't return.</text>
<u_review>"the vatican" skillet is yummy.  but the pancakes are to die for...something about 'em, whether it is because they are buttermilk, or whether it is because the syrup is served warm...i dunno.  other than that, this restaurant is pretty similar to a cracker barrel and the like.  good, but i wouldn't go too far out of my way.</u_review>
<u_review>ok, to be fair, my fellow yelpers must know that the manager of st. francis has attempted to remedy my last review by offering me dinner on him.  yes, i was sent a gift certificate so that i might try dinner again.  i love that gesture, and it was very much appreciated!  i am only sorry that it took me so long to 1) return, and 2) to update my review.  i returned for a visit at the first part of september.  however, my position remains the same.  i really do love the ambiance!  but my service experience has been just poor...defined as not attentive, and not even very friendly.  i would have loved to have been able to write an improved review but...when there are so many restaurants that serve me well, i will have to pass on this one.  :-(</u_review>
<u_review>i'm pissed.  surprised...and pissed.  what the hell happened to orange table!?  my boyfriend and i stopped for breakfast on sunday and experienced the worst service i think that i have had anywhere!  we ordered breakfast.  after waiting 25 minutes (for eggs, people...eggs...this is not a big deal), i went inside (because the waiter was not conscientious enough to come to us) to ask if there was a problem with our order.  the response was, and i quote, "the kitchen is backed up; it should be out in a few minutes."  note: there was no apology for the wait, and no effort to appease me.  after waiting another 10 minutes, a waitress came by and asked generally if we were having a good day.  when we said that we would feel better about our day if we were able to get our food, the response was, and i quote: "haven't you ever been here on the weekend.  we are always slow on the weekend."  are you friggin' kidding me!!!?  this is an appropriate response!?  again, no apology.  no offer of coffee or roll or something while we wait.  and is slow service ever an acceptable policy!?  a few more minutes went by; my boyfriend and i stood up to leave just as our food was coming.  we even said to the waiter, "we were just going to leave."  no response.  none!  couldn't friggin' believe it.  i used to tell everyone about this place.  no more.</u_review>
<u_review>i really would prefer to rate this restaurant a 2.5 but...  what is it that gives a bar, restaurant, etc. its vibe?  this bar is a bit dated and seems to be representative of what hotel bars were before they were swank.  meaning, i almost expect "two wild and crazy guys" to come walking through the entry.  there were very few people in this bar and the music selection was horrible.  however, the bartender, mark (i believe) from minneapolis, was really terrific: a friendly guy who made certain that our glasses were always full.</u_review>
<b_review>the duck pond was my favorite part , but it is kind of dirty and lacking pond plants for the turtles that live there.  if you are shopping along this strip and need a break this will do because it is not the worst but also not the best in american style mexican cuisine.  we thought we were going to try the $14.95 buffet but took a peek and decided against it because nothing to use looked appetizing and there were very few choices i think only 6 buffet pans plus an omelet station .  they gave us the chips and the 3 sauces so maybe it's just me but all 3 sauces had an unusual ingredient added that i didn't care for .  my chicken fajita salad came and i do note this was the greasiest and oiliest one i have ever had it was very generous with peppers and onions and red cabbage that i picked out because dripping with oil . the chicken had an odd texture sort of dried out but juicy like a dry sponge with liquid . my salad also came with mexican style sour cream and  guacamole . i asked for the re fried beans on the side and my husband tried them he said they were just unseasoned whipped beans that really needed some salt .  my husband tried the carnitas and thought the actual pork was ok but the black beans that came with it just had an awful smoke flavor to them and he also wasn't a fan of the corn tortillas . he was having gastric problems the next day and thought it was from here since  i was fine and it was the only food we had different the day before . (so it seemed like kind of visiting mexico for real) i can't say positively that this was from here just a guess .  if you dine here a table would be better than a booth because you will have a better view of the ducks , swans and turtles .</b_review>
<b_review>i'm perplexed by all of the 4+ star reviews for this restaurant.  we were seated on the patio, which was nice.  the food was not impressive at all.  the pollo fundido that everyone raves about was dry and there wasn't enough of the jalapeno cream sauce.  i was dissapointed that when my daughter found hair in her food, they still charged us for the meal because they remade her plate.  the problem however, was my daughter had lost her appetite from seeing the hair and couldn't eat her food anyways.    my husband ordered the lamb stew.  the sauce was seasoned well, but the lamb was very dry, just like my plate.  this restaurant was packed, so people must have good experiences here, but as for our family, we won't go back.</b_review>
<b_review>and to think i loved this place as a tourist. whenever i'd visit phoenix i'd eat at encanto. now that i live here, you can't pay me to go. the food is average at best -- especially considering the prices -- and the duck pond is nothing short of disgusting.   besides, if you have kids (like i do) you're almost required to take them to feed the ducks which means you're walking through what the ducks (ahem) leave behind. multiply that times 100 and imagine what the restaurant's floor is covered in. i'm just saying.</b_review>
<b_review>meh... lots of flies buzzing us inside.. we ended up moving to a different table to avoid them.  food was ok. service was good. margaritas were excellent.  salsa was average.  there is too much competition for me to bother going back.</b_review>

<text>to all you scottstitutes,  we've noticed that ever since westgate opened, you've been quite the fixture at your modest, trendy over-priced hellhole of a strip mall. we really do appreciate your company, and we especially appreciate all of that fancy scottsdale money you keep throwing at all the local businesses. but i'm getting the feeling that you're still not "getting" it. there seems to be some misunderstandings and misconceptions about westgate, and i would like to take this opportunity to clear some of them up for you.  1) i don't care how expensive your meal or that new pair of pumas was, you're still on the west side. hence all the chains. that 40 dollar bottle of face cream your girlfriend just got could've been bought at arrowhead mall.   2) this is not your neighborhood. don't let the condos and 12 dollar appetizers fool you. one step outside of the parking lot and you're in the fucking jungle, my friend. and the jungle is a "no popped collar" zone. i've looked into it.   3) while some of the businesses may seem to have been imported from scottsdale, the uninspired employees who work at these establishments are definitely not. you may have noticed that when you try to park in certain public spaces by the stadium, you'll be approached by grizzled men in "parking staff" shirts demanding that you pay them to park in "their" area. or that when you complain to the waiter that your meal is being rained on by a leaky pipe, he just laughs and offers you a napkin. this is the west side, sucka. as dracula once said, "our ways are not your ways".  4) while the tragically underdressed plebians and their families roaming the strip mall may be unsightly and crude, the fact is they live here.   5) don't bitch about how happy hour is so crowded. this is the only time that the aforementioned locals can afford to eat at all these fine establishments.   6) if the piano bar on the second level charges you a cover, it's probably because they don't think your girlfriend is all that hot. or because you don't have one in the first place. oh, burned by the doorman!  7) if there's a wait to get a table at yardhouse, the last thing you should do is walk back and forth by the patio waiting for a table to magically open up. it only entices those with a table to order more booze and keep their table longer.   8) if you're afraid of clowns or people in stilts, don't go to margaritaville before a game/concert. they can sense your fear and will only use it against you.  9) while it may be tempting, do not make out on the escalator, no matter how hard the mood strikes you. there is a 80 percent chance that some teenager is running as fast as fast as he can to go in the opposite way on the one you're on.   10) if you're going to ask me what time it is, at least have the common fucking sense to hide your watch. if you can't figure out what i am, then you can stand by the restrooms and see which one i go into, like all the other sane people do.  thank you/go fuck yourself, jetta</text>
<u_review>hot lesbians...check. adorable gay couples...check. foxy ladies of ambiguous birth gender...check and check. awkward straight guy with popped collar with wary look in eyes...check. tight music that i'd never admit to liking outside of the club...check and balance.  yeah. i couldn't love this place more even if some random act of kindness made my heart grow three times larger.   don't let that stop you from walking up to me and giving me a sandwich and five bucks, though.</u_review>
<u_review>(torn over my feelings for chill out, i have decided to debate with myself, like i did in front of my child psychologist.)  + what i love about central phoenix is like, no matter what i'm in the mood for, there's always something close by that can satiate my craving. it's a good thing i don't crave fried chicken and mongolian hot pot too often, i guess.   - oh shut the fuck up. you weren't "craving" anything until you heard someone at tammie coe say the word "gelato". it just happened to be there.  + still, you can't deny the awesomeness of a gelato place on the row.   - right, because no neighborhood is complete without a generic "alternative to ice cream" shop.   + it is not generic.   - let's do a rundown, shall we? painfully cliche "pun on something cold-related" name...check. tacky decor...check. same assortment of predictable flavors...check.  + okay, you seriously need to stfu. this isn't baskin robbins. you can't blame them for having a limited selection. it's gelato, a dessert that while delicious is simply not as popular or as easy to mass produce as ice cream. you can't fault them for not splurging on crazy flavors and toppings. you have to serve what you know will sell. besides, they had a couple unique flavors. like the bananas foster, you know, the flavor i, uh, we had that day.  - oh my god, after the third spoonful or so i thought there were cuts on my tongue. it was so sharp and tart, it stung. i couldn't even taste any cinnamon or brown sugar.   + i detected just a hint of rum flavor.  - you're the last person i'd talk to about flavor. you, who swear up and down that the sweat behind your ears smells like pizza hut breadsticks.  + okay now that was out of bounds.   - and sorbet's nice and all, but would it kill anyone to have soy gelato on hand? i know it exists, i've seen it at whole foods. i mean, i'm not bashing chill out for not having soy, i just, you know, i'm just tired of sorbet.  + you have never eaten sorbet, ever.  - i could eat sorbet.  + your negative bullshit aside, i still think it was pretty good, especially at that price. i mean, as long as you're buying the gelato and not any of the coke products. ugh. i'm so over drinks in plastic bottles. so not green.  - and what would be better for the environment, miss earth day?  + just carry a reusable bottle or thermos and have them fill that up for you. well, if they had a fountain and not a cabinet of overpriced high fructose corn---i'm starting to sound like you, aren't i?  - cthulu forbid.  + i think in time, if they try to expand their menu it could be a real "cold spot". get it? you know, instead of a hot spot.  - die in a fire, you vapid twat.   + bite me, lilith fair.</u_review>
<u_review>i'm torn over how i feel about ichi ban; i love it for its atmosphere and flavor, but every time i look at their menu (and my subsequent bill) i am constantly reminded that i am not loved in return. it's heartbreaking.  for what they charge for sushi, i want to see the pond where the sushi chef spears the fish himself.   i give ichi ban props for making their waitresses wear kimonos. not to sound like a total bitch, but i find it most distressing when i go into an ethnic restaurant and find everyone dressed like the jerkoff at the verizon store. it just seems really suspicious to me; like they expect me to put faith in their culture's cuisine but don't even bother to dress the part. don't mind me. i'm just obsessed with aesthetics.  oh, ichi ban always plays authentic japanese music while you get your sushi on. which i appreciate. nothing would ruin a plate of tuna rolls like having to listen to linkin park while i eat.  if you have a sadomasochistic relationship with your wallet (or manage to hook up with one of the many "money is no object, but it's all i think about" types that are springing up all over our once nice and ghetto west side), the food is pretty damn yummy.   i recommend the tempura, the boat, and any of the sushi combos.  try the philadelphia roll if you don't have an aversion to cream cheese.   don't bother getting a soda. get the iced green tea. it only costs a dollar and is amazing.   if you want dessert, i suggest you venture across the street to any of the corporate chains. i rarely advocate going chain over local, but for the love of zeus, 3 dollars for two balls of mochi?   you get six mochi in a box of trader joe's mochi balls for about the same price.  usually when someone wants to screw you over like that they have the common decency to give you their phone number.  ichi ban is a good one-time or maybe once-a-month treat. but for those with a budget, i'd suggest any of the lesser known and less expensive alternatives.  and no, i'm not talking about kyoto bowl.  have some dignity.</u_review>
<u_review>==warning: much of this review will contain lingo pertaining to the lgbt community. if you come across a word you aren't familiar with, wikipedia it.==  ever since homme gave me the boot, i'd been looking for other lgbt-friendly bars to take my business (and obsession with pool, which i totally suck at).  when my friend fenyx (a fellow tranny in the "ftm" vein) first suggested going to bunkhouse, i was admittedly a little anxious. don't get me wrong; i have no problems being around bears. but gay bars are opened so that people of that orientation can mingle and socialize within it, and i don't like being anybody's unwanted guest.   bunkhouse is like a living, breathing outback steakhouse commercial; "men's men" sit around a fire pit, joking and laughing underneath the gaze of totem poles. the interior is so fabulously "frontier". multiple big screen tvs play muted cable programs that are ignored by the patrons. it's like a bizarro sports bar. and i know bizarro.  one of the many reasons i prefer lgbt-bars to "straight bars" is that every gay bar i've been to in this city, every drink i order, no matter how obscure and/or hard to memorize, is given to me enthusiastically. sometimes it's outrageously expensive, especially if i'm not the gender of the bartender's preferred company.   and sometimes i'm given the stink eye when i insist on being given the correct, iba-sanctioned garnish with my drink. i'm just trying to get the most out of my pbsa education. don't judge me.  but never once have i been told "you want a what? are you gay?" (river city) or "yeah, that's not going to happen" (tiki lounge). not even at homme.   at bunkhouse i asked for a colorado bulldog, and the bartender just nodded and made it happen for me, even though everybody around me all turned their heads and said "what the fuck is that?" and it was delicious. so delicious that i overlooked the fact that it was not served to me in the bucket glass as deemed appropriate by the iba. i think i officially need help.  i'm sure there were plenty of fun-loving interesting people at bunkhouse, but i didn't make any attempt to talk to any. i was too busy blowing all my quarters on the pool tables, pinball machines and electronic dart boards. surprisingly, these attractions were unmanned during my entire visit to bunkhouse, probably because, as mentioned before, people were too busy like, talking and socially interacting.   making new friends? fuck that, they have south park pinball!  at first i was a little uncomfortable, being the only girl in the bar. but by the end of the night there were other girls, a lesbian couple, and even some drag queens from the show at cruisin' 7th. and everyone was just as welcome as the bears and leather daddies.   the staff at bunkhouse was really friendly, in that genuinely swishy way. (oh noes, another strange and foreign word! i checked, wikipedia has an entry for this one too.) the staff at any bar really set the tone for the behavior of the patrons. the bartender could've given me that "what the fuck are you doing here" look when i came up to order my drink, thus setting off the alert to the patrons that perhaps i didn't belong there and needed to be treated as such.   but they were really nice to me, got me anything i asked, and when the soda gun started pouring out syrup-less soda water, they dumped the glass out into the sink and made me a new drink rather than just passing me the diluted soda water and shrugging. i've had my heart broken by bartenders in the past, but i think bunkhouse may be able to set me on the path to healing.  on sundays they have $3 burgers and $1 drafts. and on thursdays everyone runs around in their underwear, though now that the weather's getting cooler i don't see that happening so much. but i could be wrong.  you know, like i was about homme and setting my nickname as "transzilla".  now i think about it, i'm wrong a lot of the time.  but that won't stop you from taking my suggestions, will it?</u_review>
<b_review>this is a super shopping and entertainment center that's much like the "riverwalk" or "city walk" places that some cities are setting up as destinations. this place has everything you would need for a successful date night - ice cream shops, restaurants, multi-screen movie theater, shopping (large chains and small one-off's) and what would be complete without excellent beer options!  parking is good and i noticed a strong security presence of rent-a-cops and actual cops. perhaps that was because there was an nfl game the next day at the nearby university of phoenix stadium, but i'm glad that they were there.</b_review>
<b_review>okay westgate is cool but really when ever did a public place close expeccially a parking lot? the cops force you to leave no matter if you saying goodbye to a loved one or not if it's after 12 you better leave right away or be forced by police....i'm sorry but if you need to kick people out you need to get gates to lock up at the end of the night, it's not right when people just want to talk to their friends they have bars there but we can't talk to our friends!</b_review>
<b_review>good lord, this place was lame on a saturday. we went around 11:30 a.m. to eat lunch at moe's southwest grill and which witch, and afterwards, we wanted to check out the shops. a little after noon, only a handful of shops were open and those were pretty much only the big name shops. even shops that had signs indicated they should be open, weren't. i don't know anything about retail shopping centers but it seems that westgate should regulate that. as a result of so many shops being closed, we were bored out of our minds. our 4 year old probably enjoyed herself the most on the splash pad.   i have been here before for a concert and it gets happening at night around the restaurants. but retail shops, um not so much.</b_review>
<b_review>if you are unfortunate enough to live in glendale/phoenix, you could try migrating here for something to do.  westgate had potential but for some reason it continues to stay pretty shady at night.  i've worked here before and visited several times to check out the bars and there's no rhyme or reason to it, it's very hit-or-miss.  saddle ranch and yard house always seem to be fun and busy.  the shops scattered around aren't anything to write home about and the fountain area is usually annoyingly loud with children trampling through the water bursts and then at night it usually switches to a teenager/date hangout.  if you are into the bar scene or staying at the renaissance, it's fun to walk over and have some drinks/dinner but i definitely wouldn't go out of your way to make it to westgate.  at night it's usually a fight waiting to happen and on ufc fight nights you'll want to avoid the area as it gets filled with "tough guys".  lots of the stores that were once there have closed as well.  if you are a young professional or want a night out on the town, i'd definitely opt for downtown as it's a bit more upscale and professional.</b_review>

<text>my gf and i fluttered over to the wcg the other night.    i was informed that wcg is "reallllly good but kinda pricey".    pshaw, i laugh in the face of pricey...   (except at mastro's, then i cry like a little girl).    walking in, i noticed the  oustide of the place was modern and lemmie tell ya, i like modern.  well lets say modernish...yeah.  before we took the plunge inside, i decided to read the gilded framed menu suspended next to the entry door;  while i was reading at least 2 different blue hairs going in had to stop and tell me how fabulous the food was .  hook , line and sinker.  i mean, if you can't believe the old farts, who can you believe?  this place is kinda dark inside. not deliverance or deer hunter dark, but "i need a night light" sorta dark.  i agree with the other yelper, this place is a nap-danger for adults.  soup should be served sparingly inside to prevent table drownings.  it was rather nice inside though, i liked it.. just dark.  the booth was nice and squishy too, just the way i like em'.  i had the 6 oz filet, and my dahlin' had the crab cakes.  both were quite tasty, but my mashed 'taters were kinda sub par considering the price tag. (why are masheds so ignored?? why??)  granted we orderd off the date menu, a fixed price bastard that let us choose 1 app, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert to share.  i'd bore the crap outta you if i went into details about every course, but they were all good in a passable kinda way.  i'm writing this review aren't i?  irony upon irony, the desserts you could pick from on said "date" menu, even though all desserts are listed at the same price, did not include the white chocolate cheese cake.  black flagged again.  i even tried to substitute and the staunchly refused.  i will get even with them i swear.  synopsis (sp?)  not bad, but once again az has introduced me to another restaurant that i don't want to frequnent often if i don't have too.  i really wanted to love wcg, but i think i'll stick with tgif's.</text>
<u_review>didn't know there were water slides that could scare the crap outta me.  park is a bit run down, and some of the slides were out of commission, but an overall good time.</u_review>
<u_review>i live near by.  i love me some burritos.    i love me some carnitas.   i love me some carnitas burritos.   i have a healthy fear of carnitas, but not from here.    lil' dirty, (not like nasty, but obviously not occ about shit here), little hokey inside ('cept the bathroom door - art nouveau shit is tiiiiight) - putting my bob ross hat on for a min... i'd say a wee bit o' nepotism is prevalent; e.g. someone's neurotic auntie got the nod to hang their interpretation of modern 'mehican'.  regardless, i'll be god damned if i'm not here at least once a week.    open at the butt crack o' dawn (6:30am)  slinging chorizo and egg 'ritos, delivering scrumtacular nacho-quesadi-lladas at night  (like 5:30pm - 9:00pm...ish).  set the bong down, and give em' a call.     repeat after me:  'i'd like the carnitas burrito'    skadoosh</u_review>
<u_review>you know, after experiencing true foods and some other restaurants fox restaurant concepts have plated up for me, i was reticent to eat at sauce.  yeah, well fuck that goofiness.  sauce is sauce-tacular, sauce-sational, sauce-ariffic even.    man this is turning into a weak-sauce review (ba-dum-chee).  i'm not drunk or high or anything, i just can't think of anything else that'll make this baby pop, you know?  lets see, me old lady and me had a cheese pizza and a salad.  thank god she only ate a few slices cause i felt the need to scarf her half of the pie in addition to mine.  and i'd say i ate a good quarter of her salad. nom nom nom.   like a fat kid at a fatty camp.    so overall, two thumbs up.  i need to try to get sauced here the next time i'm here.    sauce.</u_review>
<u_review>i'm finding it very hard to conjure up good memories about mexican food...  "whats your favorite mexican restaurant?"  **shruggs**  honestly, with all my visits to filibertos, alibertos, rolibertos, polibertos, on the boarder, chevy's, arriba's, nana's, la parilla sueza, el encanto, etc, i cannot say i preffer any of them over the other.  they all mesh together into some big gooey memory of mexican mediocrity.  i mean i like mexican food, i really do, but i guess i've never had a preference to where i have it...  until now....  i experienced the el pastor (pork) dish, which had been marinated in a red chile sauce, and was served with rice, refried beans, some pico and a huge ,fresh, hot flour tortilla.  delish.  even my 5 year old who hates anything that may be remotely caliente was duped into eating some of this... she declared it muy delicioso aswell, but was rather pissed about being tricked into eating mildly spicy food.   i want nacho's next time.    yes its in a gas station.  so what?  put your big boy pants on and get you some mexi-luvin.</u_review>
<b_review>we are frequent visitors of the white chocolate grill ever since it opened.  we consider ourselves foodies and appreciate fine dining and trying new restaurants.  the service has always been great and the food has never disappointed.  we usually split the prime rib french dip sandwich and the meat is cooked medium and is very lean, hardly any fat.  the au jus is standard.  it also comes with a horseradish dip as well which packs a little punch although not enough to open up the nasal passages in the summer.  the spinach/artichoke dip is very good!  the chips are thin and tasty with just the right amount of salt and the spinach/artichoke dip is better than houston's (i know that sounds blasphemous).  the star of the show however is the "soon to be famous" white chocolate brownie...this is the most incredibly rich and pure decadent desserts we have ever had!  it is a must to try this dessert!  the combination of the the brownie, chocolate sauce along with white chocolate shavings, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream is the perfect blend of all things sweet without being overly sweet.  we've frequenting this place since our daughter was 6 months old and that was 4 years ago.  wcg has always been one of our favorite saturday lunch destinations!    you gotta go!</b_review>
<b_review>i've now been to the wcg twice.  the first time i went, i only had a salad.  only salad has new meaning here as they have some fantastic salads.  in fact, several people at the table said they had never had a salad so wonderful.  i also heard that the seared ahi was to die for.  salads were just filler as prelude to desert however.  everyone at the table ordered something different and they were all passed around.  i can highly recommend the cheesecake and the banana pudding.  both were outstanding.  on my second visit i tried the parmesan crusted filet.  it was to die for and i ate way more of it than intended.  i also enjoyed the mashed potatoes and shared someone else's honey roasted carrots.  tablemates had ribs and the steak sandwich and both had rave reviews.  overall the service was wonderful, the atmosphere is relaxing and reasonably quiet even when the place is busy.  the food is excellent (i have not heard a bad thing about any dish) and the dessert is worth the trip.  they even list it first on the menu; a sure sign of something great!</b_review>
<b_review>when visiting the scottsdale area, i had the opportunity to eat at the while chocolate grill, an honest american dining experience, two times.  the salads are amazing, the service was excellent and i couldn't wait to go back for the filet mignon cob salad.   we were wondering why everyone doesn't get a little piece of white chocolate with the bill......</b_review>
<b_review>expect  it to be busy and fairly loud when you go. the noise level was not as bad in the seating around the corner to the left, from the entrance.   service: service was top notch. we did not need for anything that night and the waitress was genuine and a professional. drinks: the mojito was disappointing. it was not the quality i would expect. food:  the prime rib french dip  was very good. the dip was not greasy and neither was meat, of which i appreciated. dessert: chocolate soufflé cake was very good.   tldr:  order the prime rib french dip for a good sandwich. service is very good here.  you can't go wrong with the chocolate soufflé cake.</b_review>

<text>not sure what exactly they serve here. i certainly wouldn't call it frozen yogurt...  i guess if you mixed a slurpee, ice cream and yogurt and made them taste like pasty, icy soft-serve you would have mojo's version of "frozen yogurt".  it doesn't help that it's ridiculously over-priced and you really have no way of knowing that the yogurt is going to cost you $7-13 (compared to $2-4 at golden spoon) until you get to the register where they weigh your self-served yogurt & toppings then empty your wallet.  also definitely not a fan of the self-serve toppings. how many booger/staph/fecal--tainted fingers do you think have been all over those serving spoons or even in (kids' fingers) the toppings?</text>
<u_review>5 star location and view.  1 star service.  2 star food quality.  1 star atmosphere.  outside of the outstanding view and patio, i'm having a hard time finding much positive to say about this place.  service sucked. for a restaurant in this price range i'd give it negative 3 stars. waiter was extremely inattentive. we ended up getting more (& better) service from a different waiter. not really sure what our waiter was doing all night since we dined late and the restaurant was nearly empty. our original waiter waited 30 to 45 minutes after we ordered to let us know that the kitchen was out of some items we ordered. this is 100% inexcusable for a restaurant in this price range.  food flavor ranged from bland to unimpressively odd. the preparation of individual items and dish combinations were overreaching, unappetizing and spectacularly disappointing.  desserts where completely underwhelming and generic in options and taste.  to add insult to injury, we were seated right next to a drunk party of 6 (the restaurant was nearly empty) who spent the entire night obnoxiously yelling over each other, constantly using vulgar language.  it was extremely difficult to hear the person directly across the table from me speak. again, for a restaurant in this price range, this is 100% unacceptable.  i'd be hard pressed to return to this restaurant even if it had tgifriday's prices.  considering the prices, i prefer to give this place negative 2 stars. i'll have to settle for 1.  if you want to enjoy the view, simply stop by for drinks.  if you want a great meal and service, save your money for someplace like blt or rancho pinot.</u_review>
<u_review>ever taken a flight on a crusty dog turd? neither have i, but i imagine it's not much unlike flying us airways--the all time worst airline in every conceivable way.  how does an airline (that is already at the bottom of the barrel) get away with cutting back so ridiculously far on service while simultaneously  jacking up prices so ridiculously high on everything from water to luggage to aisle seats?!  wow, great business plan, douchebags--take something that already sucks, make it worse and charge people more for it!    honestly, i wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the greedy crack smokers that run this airline started charging for toilet paper. by the square.</u_review>
<u_review>their strawberry pancakes are effing amazing! well, at least the syrup is--they make it with your order. no joke. the pancakes themselves are pretty good. orange table is one of (if not #1) our favorite places for breakfast in scottsdale.   best of all--if you have a pooch you can bring him/her and sit on the patio.</u_review>
<u_review>can't really say anything about the place that hasn't already been said--great service, cool, relaxed atmosphere, best bar food i've ever had, killer fries, kiltlifter's great, 8th street ale's pretty good, blah, blah, blah. . . it's all true.  actually i take that back--try the stuffed chicken if it's on the menu. (it's a special) it's effing awesome.  this place truly does have the best bar food. anywhere.</u_review>
<b_review>okay... i just realized i am a flavor whore. i'm just not satisfied unless my frozen yogurt cup has 5 or more flavors. i especially like the fruity, no dairy flavors and mojo had only one choice for that. :( i would compare the options to golden spoon. sooo... i continue my hunt for my favorite yogurt shop.</b_review>
<b_review>i used to think mojo was fine until i began yogurt-quest 2010 with my boyfriend. now that i've tried a lot of other places, mojo has gone to the bottom of my list. they do have a variety of flavors, but the yogurt taste and texture just doesn't quite do it for me. something is slightly off. mojo is doing something right with their branding because they do get quite a following. the crowds at mojo are yet another reason for me to patronize other smaller places: shorter lines and places to sit.</b_review>
<b_review>i can't remember the last time i had frozen yogurt. either it was big back in the day and kinda went on hiatus or i just haven't been paying attention. either way, we went to mojo the other night and wow! so amazingly good. i love the "make your own" style and selection options. my favorite is the lemonade yogurt with fresh blueberries. push the little blues down into the yogurt so they freeze up, so tasty! great place to swing by and grab a treat. we have become regulars. stroll down city north, stop at press coffee and mojo and enjoy yourself. :)</b_review>
<b_review>love the yogurt, loathe the staff. rude, disinterested, and condescending. last time we were there i used the experience to educate my son about customer service and why it's important. expecting a high school (college?) kid to smile, greet the customer and be pleasant as they're ringing up my fro-yo really isn't a lot to ask. and i blame the management because they tolerate the rudeness. normally i wouldn't patronize a place with lousy customer service, but i keep coming back only because it's the only frozen yogurt place in my neighborhood.</b_review>

<text>visted twice in the past few weeks.  first visit was for happy hour, and i tried three items at $5 each: the house margarita, the churrasco (steak skewers) cooked medium-rare, and a tex-mex take on eggrolls.  loved the margarita... one of the best i've ever had!  really liked the eggrolls (pork, carrots, black beans).  can't say the same for the skewers, though, as they weren't cooked enough- chewy texture and still pretty bloody, actually.  yes, i ordered them cooked medium-rare, but i've ordered steak burgers at the same temperature before at a few other places and all came out very edible.  these weren't.  if i were to order them again, and i probably won't, i'd go for medium to medium-well.   on the second visit, i had their cheeseburger, cooked medium-rare, with smoked gouda (wow!), sweet potato fries as the accompanying side, and (subbed) chipotle mayo.  i found the buns used very, very tasty- loved the grilled texture.  last, but certainly not least, the sweet potato fries were superb!  these were light, non-greasy, no cinnamon-sugar coating, and easy on the salt.  i loved it both ways- at times plain, and other times dipped in the chipotle mayo.  should i ever have a craving for spf, i'm heading to cafe carumba!   very friendly service and clean women's restroom.  i'll definitely be back!</text>
<u_review>stopped by to check out the place and ask if the ice cream flavors were made with corn syrup (yes).  however, the nice man, whose name is terry, took the time to tell me about their products, and i became very interested in their custom-roasted beans from miscela d'oro.  terry kindly obliged to let me sample a "cortadito," http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petersens-old-fashion-ice-cream-scottsdale-2?userid=m9rrm6eo5ybklkmg5qiipa#tmgvi9oru0jnori3jpkt7w a taste of cortado, a single espresso mixed with (sweetened) milk.  now, i usually drink my coffee black, preferring to glean calories off of sweet pastries, pancakes, and waffles instead, so i was glad that terry had not told me that he was going to add the sweet milk-- i most likely would've skipped it!  the cortadito was a beauty to look at and so velvety and luscious, that i savored each and every sip.  after a delightful chat, i continued on to visit a favorite coffee shop nearby and the second of three breakfast stops for sweets.  an hour or two later, i walked back to petersen's to buy a cup of drip coffee to help me finish off a few more sweet bites.  i'm definitely coming back to have a cortado!  (and maybe buy a chocolate-dipped waffle cone to complement.)</u_review>
<u_review>after treating mom and myself to both a relaxing and totally rejuvenating 90-minute massage sessions at swiha, we headed to sushi 101 (my second visit, her first!) for happy hour.  we arrived at around 5:30p and sat ourselves at the sushi counter, said hello to tots, who smiled and greeted us warmly.  as i've said before, don't let his young looks fool you- he's competent, he's quick, and he even has a great memory!  all it took was for me to say "no *..." and he completed my sentence by recalling all the food allergies i have to worry about when dining at a sushi establishment!  kudos to tots, and to sushi 101 for employing employees like him!  since i was dining again with mom, i forgot to take photos, but i assure you, we thoroughly enjoyed each and every dish we tried (well, all but one*, that is)...  two bowls of miso soup- complimentary, if sitting at the sushi counter.  was surprised to find out that their miso base did not contain *!  i've had to avoid miso for so long now, that it was such a treat to enjoy again.  lovely, rich flavor, with scallions and tofu, but a little bit on the salty side.  i'll be sure to have some everytime i visit!    vegetable tempura; $3/2 pcs. sweet potato, 2 pcs. zucchini, 1 pc. onion ring, 1 pc. broccoli- we ended up ordering another serving, for a total of two dishes, $6  *gyoza, $3/5 pcs.- couldn't try these myself as they contained mushrooms.  mom decided she won't order these pork-filled dumplings again, saying they weren't very good.  i noticed she ate all but one ;)  spider roll, $6.95/5 pcs.- pure joy! rainbow roll, $8.95/8 pcs.- sublime!  volcano roll, $9.50/8 pcs.- scallops, crab, asparagus, yamogobo, and smelt roe!  served warm, and will definitely be a "repeat guest performer" at many happy hour meals to come.   total bill $45.00, including 20% tip, for two people.  bill is for food only, as we didn't order any beverages save iced water.  offered to split a bottle of tsingtao with her ($2 or $2.50), but she turned it down.  no biggie.  i'm all about eating my calories anyway :d   again, if my descriptions of the rolls sound like they're lacking in traditional ingredients, you're not mistaken.  i've had to ask for substitutions as i'm allergic to many sushi ingredients.  another reason why i love patronizing tots and sushi 101- they're so accommodating!!</u_review>
<u_review>short version:  1. confirm room location is decent if using aaa discount. 2. visit during seasons you're able to take advantage of the waterpark- an ammenities' fee of at least $25 will be added to your daily room charge, and do check out fitness center and class schedules! 3. if available, costco sells az grand resort giftcards at a discounted rate.  use these to pay for the room, spa packages, and dining venues!  sadly, these giftcards weren't around when i stayed here :(  long, drawn-out version.  (grab a cup of your caffeinated beverage of choice.)  stayed here for two weeks back in january 2008 while my builder did repairs on my ceiling.  luckily, i have aaa coverage and was able to get a discounted rate.  the room was inviting and tastefully-furnished, and we enjoyed the comfortable down-filled bedding; however, i was disappointed in the location of the room's building.  i had the feeling that we were the only ones lodging at the wing where construction was going on the entire length of our stay.  the noise was not audible from our room while the doors and windows were closed, but we would always have to inhale airborne particles and fumes and walk through dust and mud- and paint-encrusted areas on our way to and from the room.  i'd be sure to confirm a nicer location before you secure a room, especially if you're using your aaa card!  i'd give a 1 or 2 star rating if basing review solely on the room and location.  during my stay, i dined at latitude 30 (fantastic halibut and dessert dishes!) and phantom horse grill ($9 french toast- made with simply bread's funky monkey cinnamon bread ("artisan cinnamon bread") battered, with raspberry cream- was great (hot and crispy!) the first time around and ho-hum (warm, but soggy) the second time; dinner was good- hope i can find a photo of it to post here soon!).  i think i read somewhere here that lat. 30 is now closed?  i hope it reopens soon!  i also took my first of two yoga sessions here and enjoyed them both.  most of the other members hold memberships at the resort's fitness center, so one does not need to be a resort guest to use the amenities here.  it was also during my stay at the resort that i was able to do my first hike ever!  one may sign up for two-hour long hikes on fridays and saturdays via the fitness center.  it happened that i was the only one who signed up for the hike, so you'd think that it would've been cancelled.  however, i called up beforehand to let the center know i was on my way, and in turn, they called up the instructor so that she'd be there in time to greet me!  since there weren't anyone else to "hold up the group," we were able to finish a hike what normally took two hours in about 90 minutes!  i found it a formidable hike, made dangerous with my wearing cross-training shoes (i slipped and stumbled a couple of times) and lugging around a roll-away backpack housing my heavy and bulky laptop (easily 15, 20 lbs).  note: the price of the room does not include a $25 per day "ammenities' fee," which is automatically added whether or not you use the ammenities.  this fee includes the use of the fitness gym, jacuzzis and saunas, and the pool/water slides.  it was too cold to swim; indeed, the pool area was closed the whole length of my stay there.  so you better believe i made use of the fitness center, which included yoga and other classes, such as spinning and aerobics.  i signed up for a tai chi class, too, but the instructor didn't show up, so the "regulars" tried to have a go at it, but it was like watching the blind leading the blind, so i gave up after about ten minutes and headed to the gym, instead.  landscaping is beautiful, especially at night where treelights transform the area into a wonderland!  (come for happy hour and/or dinner and then go for a walk after... you'll have to visit to believe it!)  fyi, be sure to do a check-list of the items in your mini-bar (i suggest you even take a photo!) so that you have proof that you did not consume anything from it.  the front desk tried to charge me for missing aspirin and a soda (we don't drink soda), even though i informed them of the missing pills within moments of our entering the room.  the charges [somewhere around $10 for two tablets and a 12 oz. soda (??)] were quickly omitted from the total.  p.s.  in case you're interested, whole foods sells simply bread's funky  monkey for about $10 a loaf (price increase!).  a better deal to buy this and make your own french toast at home, if you ask me!  (aj's fine foods may offer the bread, as well...)</u_review>
<u_review>5/2/13  terrific lunch service today!    parked my car and headed up to the door, but before i was at arm's length to reach for the door, a young woman, with a huge smile, opened the door for me and bade me welcome- what a great way to start my experience!  was asked if i preferred to sit at the lounge or at the dining room; i said the lounge, and where it was nice and bright and a view of the outdoors.  was greeted by my server, oscar, who asked what i'd like to drink.  "water, please," and a few seconds later, a glass of iced water was set down in front of me, and what else do we have here, but a basket of sesame lavosh and warm seeded sourdough rolls! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=edjhpe7to8nc9bamcmfrsq#edjhpe7to8nc9bamcmfrsq  i really liked how it was a 1-2 event- first the glass of water, and then the bread basket and saucer plate of butter next to it.  awesome!  i also ordered a cappuccino http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=pg4x2qsqmiwrloaunrfkia#pg4x2qsqmiwrloaunrfkia, which wasn't on the menu, but i was told it could be done.  (it was delicious, with a healthy dusting of cinnamon!)  loved the crystalized sugar stick that adorned the saucer.  i didn't use it, but i still have it as a delightful souvenir.  :)  ordered the ribeye sandwich with truffled fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=qxlg0zw95m9q-oj8h-cy6a#qxlg0zw95m9q-oj8h-cy6a and a flourless chocolate cake. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=eqgjxtb2xbviam_9u9hnva#eqgjxtb2xbviam_9u9hnva  the ribeye was, of course, delicious, since it's one of the fattiest cuts of meat there is.  it was tremendously good during lunch, and i was content to trim off the fatty bits.**  the sourdough bread was fantastic!  loved the outer crunch and the chewy interior.  the flourless chocolate cake is not to be missed!  it took a long time for it to come out, so i at first was expecting something very warm, perhaps like a lava cake, but around 15 minutes after i'd ordered it, out came a cold plate, with cold dense, and fudgy cake, with six luscious raspberries glued to the plate with raspberry glace and chocolate syrup.    wouldn't hesitate to return to try other lunch options!  **either i ate the half that wasn't "too" fatty (i'd say the half-portion i ate at the resto was 1/3 fat, which i trimmed off before consuming) and the other half was almost all-fat (maybe a fifth was protein), or refrigeration doesn't do a cooked ribeye well, for my lunch the next day was a bust!  if you're a petite person like me, or someone with a smaller appetite, i'd suggest you share this steak sandwich with a friend, wait till you have someone with similar needs willing to share it with you, or be resigned to throw away the portion you don't finish.  at $20, i'd rather put my cash to better use.</u_review>
<b_review>i used to go to cafe carumba a few times a month when i worked in old town and i loved it! the food has a unique flavor and the decor is pretty cool. i always get the sundried tomato basil quesadilla. yumm! it's stuffed with cheese and peppers and it is sooo good. i've had a few other things there as well and have never been disappointed.  the service is always really good and quick (i have only been there for breakfast/lunch so i don't know about the dinner rush) one waiter always ends the meal by bringing your check and asking if you'd like to hear a joke or a riddle. take the joke....it's pretty funny  =)  only downside is that this place is very "scottsdale" if you know what i mean. but i guess that is part of the fun of it. definitely stop in and check this place out if you get the chance.</b_review>
<b_review>came here for lunch the other day. it was my second time here, but my first was a very long time ago... i think when they first opened. i like their menu, many things appealed to me and i had a hard time deciding what i wanted. i ended up choosing the turkey dofino wrap with sweet potato fries. yummy! the only thing i did not like was the sauce that came with it... i am assuming that it was for the fries but either way it was way to sweet for my tastes:). i will definitely be back!</b_review>
<b_review>but wait!!!  $5 margaritas have been extended all summer!  and they are good.  i try to get the secret recipe out of the bartender but he won't tell me.    in addition to great margaritas, this place also has decent food.  we've never been disappointed.  in fact, we were just there friday and they had the most awesome gorgonzola mashed potatoes.  you will not be disappointed.    and the folks who work there are incredibly nice.  we wanted to walk around after dinner so they let me keep my left overs there while we walked.  so sweet!</b_review>
<b_review>driving around today we got the munchies. was looking for jacquelines market place, but didn't realize that it was renamed to cafe carumba about 5 years ago. i fought with the idea of having breakfast, but since i all ready ate breakfast, i settled on the appetizers.there were four of us so we all ordered appetizers: tres hummus plate, nachos in a bowl with tri-color chips, chicken quesadilla and chipotle southwest eggroll.  that hit the spot. the nachos in a bowl and southwest egg rolls were a hit and the quesdilla and hummus plate were okay. the server was slow coming to our patio table, maybe it was because he or someone dropped a tray load of water glasses by the entrance to the patio...job opening. but, after that, he was very attentive.</b_review>

<text>with a fairly large selection of dynamite sandwiches and sugary baked goods, lgo has become a pretty regular staple for me at lunchtime. it has an open and relaxing atmosphere with lots of windows and natural lighting, a solid beer and even solider wine selection, and a grocery store with cute little knick knacks that's fun to peruse. this place is great.</text>
<u_review>i like the vig, and am sure i'll be coming back again in the near future, but in general i'm just not that impressed. good food and a cool, laid back atmosphere go a long way, but annoyingly slow and inattentive service go a long way too. we most recently had a group ranging from ten to fifteen, getting lots of food and drinks... well... attempting to get lots of food and drinks... and the service was just bad. they would only take a couple drink or food orders at once, not the order for the whole group, and we would have some people on their third drink while someone else was begging to get a first... it was just frustrating... at the end of the day i think you should try the vig, it is a cool place worth spending some time in, but don't expect any type of perfection.</u_review>
<u_review>i know it's a chain. i know it's a fast food burger joint. i know they have a small menu. i know. but damn, is it good. and damn, do they try their hardest to make fast food with quality ingredients. and damn, do they serve the heck out of anyone who walks in their doors with a smile. these four stars come hard-earned.</u_review>
<u_review>kristen and i are practically regulars here. i remember the first time we went after hearing about it here on yelp, we ended up leaving with the 'ole "where have you been my whole life" feeling. this place is awesome.      the cornish pasty is located on the side of a very random and small strip mall, if you didn't know you were looking for it you would probably not even notice it. it is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, i believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. it just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. we have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be.  the food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. we have probably been here a couple dozen times and i have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty i didn't enjoy yet. kristen's favorites are the italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and i can attest, they are both delicious. my favorites are the mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the shepard's pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. and if you enjoy the occasional beer, rogue hazelnut brown nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews.      if you have not tried the cornish pasty company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks. you having nothing to lose.</u_review>
<u_review>with constantly changing flavors and owners who aren't afraid to experiment with odd combinations, how could you not love it? you get what you want, pay what you want, and get to interact with helpful and friendly staff. who could complain?</u_review>
<b_review>la grande orange is my second home. you will find me here most weeekdays with my laptop enjoying the free wifi and some yummy food. this place tends to confuse people, so here is the deal. la grande orange is owned by the ever so easy on the eyes craig demarco. he also owns postino wine cafe (2 locations), la grande orange pizzeria and radio milano in the valley in addition to a few in california.  first of all the grocery or lgo is not really a grocery. it is a self-serve restaurant featuring breakfast and lunch all day. in addition they sell lots of wine, specialty grocery items and lots of stuff you never knew you needed. once you get your food you may sit outside or at the few inside tables or you may also sit in the pizzeria side till 4pm. this is where it gets fuzzy. on fridays you can also order pizza in the grocery starting at noon  and eat it in the pizzeria until 4pm. at 4pm they start full service and then you have to be seated and are waited on. confusing to newbies, but it works.   this place is full of regulars. mostly business types, self employed or others than can take a 2-3 hour lunch. they have wifi and so people come and get some work done while having a bite and there are always several tables with casual meetings or get togethers. it is a comfortable inviting place once you know the drill. my only beef is they don't serve breakfast alcoholic drinks like bloody marys or mimosas, but i would never leave if they did, so all is well, try their havana latte, croque madame, san danielle special sandwich, any salad... you can't go wrong here.</b_review>
<b_review>so i am in phoenix for the first time on a business trip and as i am going to my meeting it is lunch time and i pass by the usual fast food options like the golden arches, kfc, dominos, taco bell and secretly hoping to find something better but i am running out of options as i draw perilously close to my destination without any food.  i entered a residential area and i thought all hope was lost for lunch but i saw a sign that just said "grocery" so i figured i could get a sandwich not expecting anything better than something that came out of 7-11 or one of those rotating vending machines.  but, instead i walked into a delightful sandwich/restaurant which some tasty options from a real kitchen.  i had the tuna salad on 9 grain and it was probably one of the best tuna salad sandwiches i have had in a long time.  it has thin slices of apple in it that really makes it sing.  la grande orange - thanks for saving me from the drudgery of fast food.</b_review>
<b_review>parking can be difficult at lunch time but worth the extra effort.  wide choice of salads, sandwiches and homemade specialty breads. the sonoma salad with mangos, goat cheese and poppy-seed dressing makes an excellent selection along with a generous freshly toasted blt on thick whole grain bread.  easily enough to share and eat on the patio.  wide selection of specialty sauces and wines.</b_review>
<b_review>awesome idea!  we stumbled across this gem while we were next door at the wine bar.  we saw a couple drinking a six pack at the grocery store's outdoor seating and thought - we're so there!  not only is it a quaint local grocery store but they also serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  their baked goods from breakfast to desserts all looked delicious and unique.  we tried their pizza - which was very good - light crust and not super oily.  we also shared their hostess like cupcake - so good.  and of course beer!  i'd love to come back for breakfast as their english muffins are fresh and to die for.</b_review>

<text>i really don't get why people love this chain so much.  that's great that the burgers are not frozen but when i eat them i don't get a good meaty flavor, all i taste is grease.  i very much prefer the sirloin burgers at jack-in-the-box.  and i don't like the whole "secret menu" concept.  call me crazy, but i want to know what my options are when i walk into a restaurant, not have to study a website beforehand.  this place is just not my thing, i guess.</text>
<u_review>i came here for a friend's birthday last week and experienced the worst service i have ever received. i don't know why, but the waitress avoided our table like the plague. it took forever just to get drinks. we arrived late, after everyone else was done eating, so my friend and i just ordered a quesadilla appetizer to split. we had to ask for plates and silverware... which she forgot and then just gave us some paper cocktail napkins instead. we had also asked for a side of beans to go with the quesadilla. she basically snorted and laughed in our faces and then never brought them out. i understand if perhaps they don't serve beans a la carte (i don't know since we were never offered menus) but there was no explanation given. i have never encountered someone with such a bad attitude at a restaurant before. the other girls said she was like that the whole night. they all left her a bad tip but i think people like that don't understand that's a signal they need to do better next time; instead it just makes the chip on their shoulder get bigger.  i am giving them an extra star since the food was decent and i liked they decor inside. we were out on the patio which was lovely. they had comfy lounge chairs and a fire pit. its the type of place i would want to hang out and drink sangria all night. i would definitely return if it weren't for our experience with this waitress. a friend who has been there before said she has had similar issues with another staff member on a separate occasion so its just not worth a return visit.</u_review>
<u_review>i stopped in here on my lunch break to try to find a father's day gift since i knew that they carried the "old guys rule" paraphernalia that my dad loves (see pics if you don't know what i am talking about). i found that they had tons of gift items for just about everyone. there were lots of funny and cool t-shirts, board shorts and swim cover-ups, a bunch of baby and kid clothes with cute and silly sayings on them. of course they had plethora of stuff promoting scottsdale and az (that's a given) but they also had a lot of cool items that were not touristy souvenirs at all. they even had higher end items like jewelery, purses, and sunglasses. i will definitely be back next time i need a gift for someone and have no idea what to get them... and it worked out well on this occasion when i did have something specific in mind, too.</u_review>
<u_review>the food and service are just average but this place has a great vibe and it is so much fun getting to sample items from the huge beer menu. if you are a beer lover, you will feel like a kid in a candy store. if you are lucky enough to get a knowledgeable server (hit or miss) they can even recommend combinations of beers that can make the experience even more interesting. same concept as ordering a black and tan or snakebite... but the flavors can get even more complicated if you are adventurous. its best to go with a large group so you can all try each other's drinks if you really want the full tasting experience.   this place also has great options for lunch when you are at the mall and they don't seem to get busy until happy hour time. but for me, it can be torture to come here and not be able to drink since i am still "on the clock".</u_review>
<u_review>brand new location right on my way to work!  it is on the se corner of rural and ray in the fry's shopping center.  even though i drive thru this intersection frequently, it is not easily seen from northbound rural since it is behind the wells fargo which i guess is why i never noticed it until today even though they have been open for two months.  i believe the building used to be a pollo loco which explains the somewhat bland structural design and awkward layout.  it is nice and big inside, though, with enough room for two full size leather couches.  a gaggle of teenagers was making good use of them on the evening we stopped by.  other than that group the place was pretty empty and so there was plenty of tables open.  i noticed that they also had a big patio with plenty more seating outside.  another nice thing is that they have a drive thru.  the easiest way to enter is from ray but it wraps all the way around the building.  hopefully that means it will be convenient and not too crazy during busy times.  i will write an update when i try it out on a weekday morning.</u_review>
<b_review>had my first experience with a in-n-out grilled cheese today with grilled onions. amazing! a must try if you love cheese! look up the secret menu online before going in to find many more tasty gems. service was fantastic as usual. overall great! love me some in-n-out!</b_review>
<b_review>the body and blood of christ???  um.... no thanks...   i'll just take a cheeseburger and a chocolate milkshake.  :-)   after two, much needed evenings of "good clean fun" ie: no jack daniels involved...my friend and i decided to decide to stop somewhere for a quick bite to eat, before going our seperate ways.... in -n -out burger it is!! the menu is simple, the food is "fast" and it dosen't make me feel nauseous after eating it..(unlike most fast food) .. well.... until tonight anyway  behold.....  bottom of the cup says john 4:16: - ted's "diet" coke (pussy)...(my milkshake had proverbs 3:5:...mmm mmm good) it appears i'm the last person on earth to notice this.... huh??  i wasn't "moved" to decipher the citations, as i don't entertain this sort of  (ahem)  nonsense... however, i did get a pretty hearty chuckle (ok, bordering on hysterical laughter) out of it. ..... private ownership and operation has it's privileges i see....  i must admit...i often get personal enjoyment out of being in the presence of people or establishments that test their freedoms.... (apparently since the 1980's in this case) and this time was no different. smiles all the way around..  i will say this...most people are idiots..  (incase you've been walking around with blinders on since birth)   and while i don't particularly enjoy being harassed while jogging down the street, minding my own business, by a couple of fellas in nicely starched white shirts and bicycle helmets..(the purpose for which i can only assume is to keep them from banging their fragile skulls into the pavement) ..i am smart enough to know that it's not my duty as a human being to entertain them either...       or even acknowledge their existance to be honest..it is that simple.... this whole cup thing seemed pretty passive to me.. and it gave me something to rant about while i ate..(not that i need help with that)  well done in-n-out..... you irritated the shit outta me......you got under my skin.... you have a voice......kudos to you. will you still see me in your drive thru???         of course... why??      i oddly respect what you're trying to pull off..... and...well.... you have one god damned tasty cheeseburger ...</b_review>
<b_review>i stopped in for a double double with everything today on the way home from school and i sat in the drive thru for about 15 minutes. not sure what was wrong, but you would think at 1:30 in the afternoon there wouldn't be that long of a wait, especially at a window. not a huge deal, but something to keep in mind if you're in a hurry  ------(.5) star deduction---- subtotal = 4.5 stars   when i got the bag the fries were nice and crisp, i could tell they were very fresh, definitely worth the wait. in-n-out fries have always been a little thin tasting if that makes any sense and these seemed about right. i still think a fresh batch of mcd's fries are better, but in general, the fries were very good.  ----no star deduction---- subtotal = 4.5 stars  the hamburger i got had lots of gooey cheese on it, just the right amount of ketchup, and the onion and tomato seemed very fresh. the bun was nice and fluffy and wasn't too heavy. overall, though, the patties were pretty thin. i've always felt that the patties at in-n-out were on the thin side and today just confirmed it. i felt like i got the same amount of burger at five guys with a single patty. the burger was very good though. i thoroughly enjoyed it.   ----no star deduction----subtotal = 4.5 stars  i typically say that there's always room for improvement, but in this case, in-n-out has their formula down pat. the offer hamburgers, fries and shakes, and they do all three very well.i give them props for execution and consistency. however, i found their lack of options for toppings lacking, and for that, i have to deduct star power.  ----(.5) star deduction---- subtotal = 4 stars  with  five guys and smashburger in town, there's some serious competition in what i like to think of as the specialty fast food hamburger joints and if in-n-out expanded their topping selections i could see them becoming my favorite burger in town, however for now, that race goes to five guys, by a thin stack of jalapeños on my burger.  ----overall star power---- 4 stars</b_review>
<b_review>jaino - just another in and out.  good burgers/fries/drinks.  great service.  crowded.  always tough to find a seat - especially when it's 100+ outside.  love in and out.</b_review>

<text>i'm fairly certain i've had a good dining experience here, though i'd be hard pressed to come up with exactly when that was. i was here the other night, and it was pretty bad. unfortunately, this result is more the rule than the exception for me. i swear this place is like the tara reid of restaurants.  the place is pretty nice... comfy chairs, loungy sofa style seating, lovely patio, clean and open dining area (with hideous gaudy bedazzled dog statues placed strategically so you can sit anywhere and see a faux diamond encrusted canine anus while you eat), and a nice long modern (for 10 years ago) bar. the exterior walls are mostly glass so if you're at all self conscious, you might feel like you're on display.   this was a mid-week night and it was pretty dead. there were literally more waitstaff than tables seated, yet the table next to us had one of their orders completely forgotten. then the same waiter kept asking what we wanted to drink and while we were ordering, he would walk away for 10 minutes. the service didn't get much better from there. when we finally got to order and then eventually get our food, it was mediocre... definitely not worth the lofty prices. in fact, the burgers used to be considered quite good here - the burger hasn't changed much, but i guess maybe the bar has been raised since they designed theirs. this place just needs to revamp a little bit i think. they also need some new staff.  like tara reid, this joint is an old diseased coked up used up whore that hangs out with the under/upper crust of society, can't act or even perform basic functions half the time, pretty much everyone has been inside at some point, half the people come to watch the train wreck while the other half comes to be on the train, and on the right nights is fun to party with.</text>
<u_review>i've been here a few times now, so i think i'm finally qualified to review it. first off, i'll say that this place is gorgeous. they put a lot of thought and money into the look of olive and ivy. it's very fancy. even the bathrooms are impressive - the stalls are like little closets with no way for your neighbor to hear you pooping or to reach under and touch your feet... you just better hope there's paper in there before you start to go. also, the doors to the stalls are nicer than any door in any house i've lived in. i'm talking big hand carved oak stained wood doors... for toilet stalls.  anyway - the rest of the place is opulently decorated and well furnished as well. there's a swanky yet sophisticated feel here. the food is above average - as are the prices - though i don't know if the prices reflect the quality of the food. they carry a decent selection of wines - having sampled quite a few, i've decided that the least expensive ones taste best.  the service wasn't great, but it was pretty busy. the layout here would be pretty confusing for any server - but combine that with low lighting conditions and you have a recipe for service disappointment. our server on my last visit was at least very sweet. in fact, i have yet to feel mistreated here, so i'd say at least they have "nice" down.   this isn't my type of crowd - unless you're asking me for a crowd i'd like to see burned alive. but as with many great places in scottsdale, you may have to bring your own crew in order to really enjoy yourself. this might be a good place to meet up for an early drink or a happy hour snack before heading out for the evening. it's definitely in a great location and like i said - it's pretty nice.</u_review>
<u_review>this place is the least douche-filled club of the douche tour in downtown scottsdale. it is a huge club and in some ways it's like an anchor store in a mall - like dillards or jc penny. you can get a little bit of everything you want in one place... it's got its share of plastics and douchebags, but also has a number of college kids venturing away from tempe to go dancing.   the place itself is kinda cool with various rooms of different themes and a good sized dance floor. the vip area upstairs is pretty neat if you can swing the fee. they have the requisite go-go dancers with giant boots on some nights and they often feature good local dj talent.  i haven't had to wait in line to go here in years because i'm always invited to go - i reckon if i had to wait in line, i'd just not go. don't buy a girl a drink - apparently, this place attracts some pretty (when it's dark) homeless alcoholics. these girls need jobs (and not boob jobs - that's already been covered).   myst is large enought that you can go here and manage to find a good time... drinks are a bit pricey, but that's par for the course in the area. it's a one-stop-shop for all your drinking and dancing and scamming needs. you're also very close to a slew of other smaller clubs of the same sort if myst isn't happening.  one of the best parts is that it's across the way from a pizza by the slice place that stays open after hours just to feed the drunk idiots so they can "sober up" for the drive home. sometimes i go here around 2am sober just to people watch... on any given night, you're likely to see either a fight break out, some drunk chick puke on her hair, or someone crying over something stupid. you also get to see everyone in the harsh fluorescent lights not looking their best - the shine and polish is gone from their outfit and the product in their hair has quit on them and the girls' makeup has given up long ago - plus, they are too drunk to suck in that gut or push out that chest. it's very amusing.  yes - myst is a good place to go if you want to go clubbing in scottsdale - send your out-of-town friends here... locals who aren't into the scene will loath it. i pretty much do.</u_review>
<u_review>a friend of mine and i were searching for a new neighborhood bar, so we checked out this place. it was a cozy little spot that was buzzing with a small local crowd. it was excellent people-watching and we felt pretty comfortable there. it just barely earns a 4 for lack of a 3.5 to score it, but it's definitely worth checking out. easy-going atmosphere and not terribly noisy or crowded.</u_review>
<u_review>i had no idea what this place was about until i walked in the door in the middle of the day the week they opened. i was greeted by a duo of incredibly pretty and young (college aged) women.   similar to tilted kilt, blondie's, and hooters - this is a place where you have your food served by beautiful young women dressed in... not much. it's an experience to be had for sure. the girls here are all pretty amazing looking - they clearly have high standards in that department.   the food was decent - it was basically bar food. the sliders weren't mind blowing and neither was the philly cheesesteak. i did really enjoy the chips and cheese sauce though. their fries are thick cut and heavily seasoned, but they weren't very crispy. i definitely want to try other items on the menu.  the place is huge and the decor is modern representation of rustic snow lodge cabin. it's new, so everything is nice and clean. there are small flatscreen televisions on the tables in the booths and large flatscreens all around the restaurant, so i imagine this would be a fun place to go out with the guys to watch the game and get away from the wives. the service was quick and the girls were all very nice and friendly. it's just that sort of place.  nobody is going to dance on your table or lap if you hand them money... it's not that sort of place. however, if you just like to have this sort of view while you eat, you can't really go wrong. at least you will go home covered in grease and smelling like 1000 island dressing rather than covered in glitter and smelling like 1000 different perfumes.   i'd rather have better food if it means more clothes on the waitresses, but that's me. i'm going to have to go back and try something else once they work the kinks out (if there are any to get worked out), but i wasn't displeased with twin peaks at all. my score is between a 3 and a 4... it's solid if this is your sort of thing.</u_review>
<b_review>i will forever lement the loss of those amazing glitter dogs. do you think they sold them? if you know what happened to them tell me cause i want one. i hated az88 for no aparent reason for a long time. i tend to hate things that young hip kids who live in scottsdale enjoy, just as a rule, so i was sure i would hate this place. i totally didn't. part of what i loved about it was those ridiculous sparkling dogs though. seriously the food is super delicious and i always worry myself sick about what to order cause will it be as delicious as elsa chicken sandwhich? also, how much do you love waffle cut fries? well i don't know how much you love them, but i love them a lot. and this place is a little classier than chik-fil-a, the only other place i know that serves waffle cut fries. even though it is in scottsdale and hip kids like it, it isn't even retardedly overpriced. you should probably go here if you haven't yet. those good for check boxes remind me that the golden gate cake thing is beyond delicious. order it.</b_review>
<b_review>this place is so hip. the atmosphere is very cool. neveau and fun.  it's like a high end martini bar with upscale bar food at reasonable prices. the buffalo chicken sandwich and hell fire fries are my personal favorite. the wings are also really good.  the martini's are also great and i have tried many of them. it's not easy to get into this place on weekend evenings or art walk nights. the service is decent. mostly dependent upon who serves you. i would highly recommend this place.</b_review>
<b_review>i really wanted to like this place because i've heard nothing but positive things about it. sadly, i didn't like it at all.   we went here on a friday night with a couple of friends and i couldn't believe i had never seen this place. but it could be because it's kind of hidden.   the place is super nice. i loved the ambiance and crowd. the service was really good. its a nice place to pre- drink before goin out. we ended up staying there til they closed. and that's where they earned two stars.  we got burgers because the friends we were out with recommened them and claimed that they were the best burgers in town...basically all the burgers are the same with slight differences. they taste the same though. i wasn't impressed. delux burger has better burgers.   the next morning was hell. my bf and i woke up with the same symptoms of sickness. mind you, we each only had one drink that night so we werent hung over. their food made us sick! we were both so sick that we couldn't move. it was awful.   but even with all that, i really want to like them so i will go back and give them another chance.</b_review>
<b_review>at the start of the old town drag by the courtyard of the scottsdale museum of contermporary art (smoca) and an art piece dedicated to love stands a longtime jewel of the old town scene. at this place, you feel concious of how you appear for there are beautiful women and handsome men with their lovers, and stalkers, laughing, smiling, flirting, kissing, loving... life... and az88. this restaurant/nightspot has been a subject of lore. at this place the martinis are big and kickin and for an evening you can feel simply beautiful and sexy. the music is pumpin with sick beats by their dj upstairs. there's an art piece in the center that exudes sex...iness. and the bar reminds you of how this la-esque place is here in our turf but scottsdale is not phoenix, it's a bit of san diego, a bit of santa monica, a bit of the marina in san fran. and you realize that its handsome men with handsome men and hot women with sexy ladies and everything in between. this is the place for gay men and women, and straight allies.   the drinks are delish, and exquisite, here a glass of something with bubbles just makes sense, couple it with a martini or two with shaker makes sense. and their burger au poivre just messes with the senses... it's overwhelming and so good! this place is contemporary chic. not ikea chic like its hot cousin fez in our cenpho which in my opinion is attaining landmark status on central. this place celebrates the hotness of the old town crowd. so if ever i want a late night place, and want to see and be the scene. i head over with some hot teases and have a fun time. hope to see you there one night, just wink.</b_review>

<text>this place is very impressive. the food is all made in house and made with natural ingredients. you can really taste the difference! and the service was great too!</text>
<u_review>i was actually pretty disappointed with this one. i love the idea of healthy eating and vegan food but this one was just okay. loving hut and green are much better. i was pretty surprised at the wonderful reviews on yelp. but i guess if you are vegan it is hard to find anywhere to eat. so myself being a meateater, i give it only 3 stars. and that was generious. but if you love vegan food like i do, try green or loving hut!</u_review>
<u_review>i am in love with otf! it's seriously the best workout you can get in an hour. i love how it just flys by. it's similar to circuit training, but you wear a heart monitor and your heart rate is displayed on a screen. it helps to push me a little bit harder so i stay in the "orange zone" longer. the staff is also super friendly and very responsive. i highly recommend checking out orange theory fitness! they offer a free trial class as well.</u_review>
<u_review>best hole in the wall mexican food in the valley! and they have a cute little salsa bar too. love it!</u_review>
<u_review>very impressive! loved their service and style. the chips and salsa had an interesting flair to it. the chips were a mixture of tortilla and wonton type chips. the salsa had a peppery flavor which was really cool. i ordered the skillet chicken which was very yummy. my hubby got the street tacos which he really enjoyed as well. he ordered a margarita and i went with the berry bubbly martini which were both delicious and very strong which is a plus. the bill was right at about $50 bucks with tip which isn't too bad considering we drank alcohol.   we also had a living social deal that expired almost a month prior and they still honored it. we will definitely be back and we'd also love to try their other restaurant, rhythm and wine!</u_review>
<b_review>great breakfast joint with amazing scrambles, omelets, wine country french toast and egg white options...  very chill place with great service and excellent food.</b_review>
<b_review>best pumpkin pancakes ever!  we got lucky to visit during pumpkin pancake season. we went back several times on our visit to scottsdale.   sadly, the pumpkin pancakes are not available on the weekends.  plan your visit accordingly!  staff was friendly and the place was super busy.  looks like they are planning to expand which is clearly a necessity!!!</b_review>
<b_review>i am a perk fan! i have eaten here at least once a week for the past two months and have not been dissapointed.   for breakfast you can't go wrong with with pancakes, simply amazing. my fiance loved the fancy pants scramble. for those that love brie cheese, this one is for you.  for lunch, the best item is the grass fed beef burger with sweet potato fries. great tasting burger and the fries are just awesome. i love the fact that they support local farmers and order grass fed beef. that is hard to find in this town, but i would gladly support any business that goes the extra mile for better ingredients. add the always great service and this local joint a winner. if they started serving dinner, i would probably never leave.</b_review>
<b_review>caught it on a good morning.  the place was humming and, unlike other reviewers, our service was spot on.  i appreciated some of their innovative takes on the standard breakfast menu, specifically the breakfast enchiladas.</b_review>

<text>i couldn't agree with david more.  the owner is definitley an interesting  person.  the more money she thinks you make, the more she will talk to and love you!  so tell her you are rich!! (sorry didi c.) as for the food -  ho hum vn food at high for what you get prices.  the pho is very avg and double the usual price. they don't charge a corkage fee for  byob which is nice.</text>
<u_review>not. good.  shameful korean food and side dishes being served up to unsuspecting, nice white folks. why is the soft tofu soup lukewarm?  where is the egg?  where is the stone bowl rice? why are the side dishes so bad?    i'm ashamed for you, red kimchi!</u_review>
<u_review>it is a bit expensive - i mean it's pizza for god's sake.  beyond that though i enjoyed the food there.  the pizzas are biancoesque even down to very similar toppings.  for me it was about as good as bianco without the ridiculous wait. good place to kick back with good friends.</u_review>
<u_review>good drink menu and good neighborhood place but not a destination restaurant be any means.  we enjoyed the food, especially the halibut.  it's tucked into a side street and is easy to miss.  it would be hard for me to go here instead of fnb since they are so close togeather.</u_review>
<u_review>like the other reviewers have said the service is really not that great.  luckily they're saved the  really good food that they have.  we ordered so much food that our little two top table  couldn't possibly handle it all.  the mussels  might have been the best i've ever had. we also shared a frito misto, which is really good except they're pretty chintzy with the shrimp they only gave us too.  the pastas were clearly handmade which appreciate and they're quite good. the owner came over to check on us a couple times which i appreciated.  i'm definitely coming back soon.</u_review>
<b_review>best vietnamese place i've eaten at outside of new york city.  maybe even the best asian food i've eaten in the phoenix area.  and it's inexpensive!  i would be a regular if i lived out there.  it's really one of the better eateries in the phoenix area.</b_review>
<b_review>i cannot believe it has taken me this long to write a review for justina duong's wonderful cyclo vietnames cuisine.  we visited cyclo for the first time on the first friday after a very positive review by the arizona republic food critic howard seftel.  the small place was slammed.  being a woman of action, i stepped in and helped by being the "hostess" and taking down names for a waiting list.  guess that helped me become friends with the acerbic but deep down sweet woman that is justina duong.  you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  spring rolls are compact but full of all sorts of meat and veggies.  bun hanoi and bun saigon are tasty treats full of fresh herbs and vegetables.  my husband loves this lemon chicken curry dish that to me smells like lemon pledge, but he gets it each time.   the beef pho is full of flavor and comes with a mound of salad, unlike some of the other "cheaper" pho shops nearby.    i can't imagine anyone has complaints with the food at cyclo.  if they do, it is probably that their judgment is clouded as they came on a friday and saturday night at 7 p.m. to a 14 table establishment and expected to be served immediately and be fawned after.  if you are this needy, don't come here and take up a table...we're waiting patiently to be served. :)</b_review>
<b_review>i have to agree with everyone who commented on justina.  she is hysterical.  the first time we where there she forced me to eat my meal with chopsticks.  she has a very dry sense of humor.  our favorite item is actually an appetizer -- the pork spare ribs.  they fall off the bone.  the chow fun is also great.    the only drawbacks are the limited menu and lack of alcohol.  they do let you bring your own alcohol with no corkage.  the place has been full every time i've been there.  there are probably about 15 tables in total so get there early!</b_review>
<b_review>while i'm reviewing pho's, i'll give my review on cyclo. this is where i'd take that cute vietnamese babe i met last week. it has great atmosphere and the food is awesome. i ate here about a week ago and had their pho bowl and it was one of the best i have tried in the valley, i really loved it. the girl who seated us was really nice and gave an enjoyable contribution to the dining experience. yes this place cost almost twice what i pay across town but worth it with the right company. my brother and i ate here and we both agreed we would probably not eat here together much but we will both be eating here again. aka we thought this was alot better place to take a girl or a business associate than our fav pho in the area to have lunch together.  cyclo has a more upscale atmosphere than the average pho and we both thought the food is above average. i don't agree with another reviewers post that the portions here are small. i had one appetizer with a pho bowl and left full.  i'm 6'3" 230 and like to eat alot and my brother who is shorter but heavier than me was complaining he ate too much after we left. one of the best phos in the east valley!</b_review>

<text>lunch at pei wei is basically a done deal.  food is consistently fast and good.  the staff was very accommodating, basically creating a new dish that my son would eat, but giving us the child's price still.  can't go wrong here.</text>
<u_review>awesome dive bar. recently opened and turned what was a quiet place into a thriving fun bar. go see the girls all dressed up, play poker or pool, and enjoy some great drink specials.</u_review>
<u_review>love this place.  good service, good (bar) food, good prices..  they have lots of tv's and plenty of sports on.  always keep the local stuff on the big screen.  i have been there for many sporting events, but was there last friday for trivia.  aside from the cheaters that beat us, we all had a great time..  we'll be back..</u_review>
<u_review>brought my son and niece here on sunday for some pizza and games.  the location is ok.  i typically go to one near arrowhead mall which sets the bar high.  this location had an ok game selection.  many of the machines were out of or not distributing tickets.  frustrating for 6 year olds.. (and 31 year olds..)  though i don't necessarily choose peter piper for their namesake, the pizza is far better than chuck e cheese's.  i'd rather eat salad then eat pizza there.  the pizza at this location was ok.  seemed to lack the flavor that i am used to, but maybe it was just me..  overall, we had a great time.  won a bunch of tickets.  i somehow managed to get both kids to save their tickets up for a bigger prize.  trust me, not an easy thing to convince a kid to do.</u_review>
<u_review>i frequent jays.  best gyro deal in the area.  the place is not fancy at all.  don't expect that great of service.  be sure to listen for your order to be up.  it is barebones, but my stop in tempe for gyros..</u_review>
<b_review>okay so this review is a little biased. the first time i went here was with my (now) x-husband, and he happened to be break out the "i want a divorce" while we were eating.   i really do like the food here, and it's an excellent place to go for a lunch break, or with your family (getting all choked up)   i love spicy food...</b_review>
<b_review>i have been sick for over a week now & was not in the mood to cook last night so i placed an online order & had my hubby go pick it up. i got our usuals; edamame, pork egg rolls & honey seared chicken with white rice. new items we tried were; crispy potsickers, mandarin kung pao chicken (mild) with fried rice & a cookie (they didn't run out this time!). the reason i dropped a star was because i gave my hubby that $10 gc that i had received about a month ago & they told him he couldn't use it. wtf, why not?! he said they didn't give him an explanation & i'm sure he was just in a hurry to get out of there. next time i'll go pick it up myself & if i am able to use it, i'll give them back their star. if i'm not able to again, then idk if i'll be back...</b_review>
<b_review>can't go wrong with pei wei! great location for dining in or sitting on the patio when az weather permits. right now they have a special menu, i tried the thai chicken lettuce wraps and they are amazing! i hope they add this as a permanent item to their menu. they also have 2 saved convenient parking spots in case you are doing pick up you can be in and out quickly</b_review>
<b_review>i'm surprised by the low reviews for pei wei.  i, frankly, like the food here and i love how they will customize your meal if you tell them to add or delete certain ingredients. and i've never had any problems getting my food in a timely manner. by chance, i discovered their edamame is out of this world!  it's sautéed in sea salt and ginger and extremely tasty.  i've tried to remake this at home but haven't quite gotten the flavor as good as theirs yet. the fact that this location is consistently busy attests to their philosophy of good food, quick, at reasonable prices. i also like how they try to change out their menus so that it's not the same items month after month, year after year. i've always loved their concept every since they opened and i hope they continue to thrive here and elsewhere in phoenix!</b_review>

<text>we ended up at elements friday night with my in-laws on their last night in phoenix, as we thought it would be a nice way to end their trip. our server was absolutely fantastic - she did a good job of answering questions, helping with selections, and making sure we had everything we needed without being in our face. since we had a later reservation (8:45 pm), the restaurant was pretty full when we arrived, but as the night progressed, it emptied out. this time, noise was not a factor which was a relief.  my father-in-law ordered the special that evening which was similar to ahi tuna...he loved it. the rest of us ordered the scallop dish...it left us a bit underwhelmed. the scallops were on the bland side, although they were cooked pretty well. they could have used some seasoning to make them really good. our desserts (chocolate torte and chocolate peanut butter decadence) were delicious and totally redeemed the meal in my mind. a bottle of wine, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts, set my in-laws back $230.  i still think elements is a great place, but my husband and i were a bit let down that it wasn't as phenomenal as last year when we went for dinner.</text>
<u_review>it's nice to have a movie theater less than 2 miles from my apartment, but unfortunately it's at tempe marketplace, which means finding parking almost ruins the movie going experience! however, if you can get past that, it's actually a pretty good movie theater for the most part. matinees are $7 for adults and they have the automated touch machines so you can bypass the line and get your tickets pretty quickly. i did have a slight problem with one of the touch machines this past weekend because a few times it took me almost pounding on the machine for my selection to be activated. even with that slight problem, i still got my ticket faster than if i had waited in line.  when you walk inside, the lobby is very spacious and the thing i have noticed everytime i have gone to a movie at this theatre is how clean it is. they offer your typical movie concessions, as well as sliders, french fries and pizza. regular sized sodas are $4.00, but for 25 cents extra you can get a "loyalty cup" which buys you $1 refills when you bring it in on future visits to harkins theaters.  the reason i can't give this theater more than 3 stars is due to the seats. goodness gracious they are uncomfortable! there is almost no give in them and within the two hours my movie played, i must have tried to adjust my position ten times and still never got completely comfortable. also, and this is a minor pet peeve, but the arm rests don't lift up. i really like that feature in other theaters.  all and all, a much better theater than the harkins at arizona mills, but not worth a special trip unless you live close to tempe marketplace and don't mind spending time hunting for parking or parking super far away.</u_review>
<u_review>maizie's, i will miss you. i had my last meal today there since i will be moving from the valley next week. of course i had to get my two favorite items on the menu one last time: basil pesto bruschetta and the groovy grilled cheese. the bread for the bruschetta is always perfectly toasted and the groovy grilled cheese found the perfect blend of brie, apple and bacon.  i only got to go to maizie's once for brunch, but it was delicious. i really enjoyed my omelet with feta, cheddar and black olives. it's actually making my mouth water now thinking about it. i guess i better learn to cook so i can make it for myself. mimosas are $3 and i have heard that they even have pitchers of mimosa during brunch!  this is a great neighborhood spot and i am going to miss it!</u_review>
<u_review>i tried gourmet house of hong kong today with a group of co-workers. i'll admit i may be a bit jaded as i would have preferred a place with a patio to take in this beautiful day, but whatever.  yes the decor sucks, it's dark inside, and the restaurant is laid out weird...but it's those things that give this place it's charm.  the menu is huge...potentially the largest menu i have seen at a chinese restaurant.  service was quick and we had ordered, ate and had the check in like 30 minutes. of course, since we were in no rush to go back to the office, we sat around and talked for another 35 minutes.  the lunch specials are cheap. like $5 or under cheap. the portions are also a reasonable size, so it's a good deal for $5.  the corn soup was...interesting to say the least. not something that i enjoyed at all.  i had the cashew chicken as my meal (it's not on the lunch special menu)...large portion, tender chicken, and lots of cashews. i didn't care for the light sauce very much actually and was disappointed when there were no green peppers in the dish. also, the carrots tasted a bit off to me.  my co-workers all enjoyed their dishes, which included sweet and sour chicken and peking duck.  the bill for the five of us (including tip) was $40. so an awesome deal, considering two people can't even eat at tgi friday's for $40 anymore.  can't say i will be running back to gourmet house of hong kong, but not a place i would avoid either.</u_review>
<u_review>so i decided after living in arizona for almost three months, it was probably time to go register my car and get a driver's license. i went the day after thanksgiving at about 3 pm. i had to have an out-of-state inspection...this was quick and easy and i got to stay sitting in my car. sweet!   i brought a book and was prepared to wait a long time once i got inside, but was pleasantly surprised when i was immediately given a number and it was called before i could even sit down. i was done with registering my car in about less than 10 minutes, which was awesome. too bad it cost me a freaking arm and leg to register it...$286 for one year?? i vowed right there to never complain about ohio's $55 annual fee ever again.  unfortunately, the computers were down that day and i couldn't get my license.  i will say that all of the workers i encountered were very nice and helpful, which was nice because i work in state government myself, so i know it can make you bitter and jaded.  the two strikes against the tempe mvd are:  *the guy who registered my car called me "sweetie" numerous times. he was probably around 37, so it creeped me out.  *no saturday hours. wtf? thank goodness i bailed out of work early so i could take car of this little matter and still make it home in time to see the end of the lsu game.</u_review>
<b_review>i was in scottsdale on business last week. my fiance and i were excited to go to elements after learning it was beau macmillan's restaurant. we didn't go in with high expectations, just wanted to have a great meal and experience.  boy, did it not disappoint.  our servers were phenomenal. i had read some of the yelp reviews prior to making our reservation and wanted to see if they were right. we didn't notice any lack of attentiveness on their end.  as an aside - if you go for dinner, definitely get a reservation around sunset. it has absolutely stunning views that shouldn't be missed.  we started off with the ahi tuna tartare. simple and executed perfectly.  my fiance got the braised short ribs which was amazing. the short ribs were incredibly tender and flavorful. about the only downside was the placement of the truffle mac and cheese (underneath the short ribs instead of off to the side). i had the duck with forbidden rice. as a duck hunter, i've had my fair share of ducks. this duck was cooked perfectly, and the cherry braised cabbage and forbidden rice completed the dish nicely.  we picked the pb bomb for dessert. don't bother looking at the menu, just get the pb bomb.  overall, there's not much more i would have improved. i'm looking forward to returning to scottsdale and stopping by elements again.</b_review>
<b_review>beau may have a great big personality with a big laugh and slightly rich view of himself, but so do lots of men.  there is one thing this man does that the others don't.  he creates and works tirelessly to produce amazingly unique food.  i attended only one of the lunch and learn events this summer, and that makes me a little sad.  this year we "experienced" the friday night event in room xii.  it was unforgettable. i love attending these things b/c you may never get  a chance for that meal again.  this meal included corn chowder with a scallop, bacon-egg salad which was so much more complex than that description,  the best sea bass i have ever tasted, short rib, and then an incredible pancotta carmel luxury take on cracker jacks. plus, wine pairings that were phenomenal. wes, our server was fantastic and very patient as we were very "exuberant".  and, special guest eddie thanks for being so fun!  if i were as talented as beau and his staff i would be down right arrogant.</b_review>
<b_review>starting with the valet the service here is impeccable. once in the restaurant it has nice decor with heat lamps using flames all around the restaurant. we were seated facing the city with a mountain view. the walls in front of us were slid open so we were essentially outside. amazing and romantic setting.   for appetizers, my wife had the fire roasted oysters.  has to be some of the best oysters we've ever had!  crusty on the top but juicy underneath.  i had the citrus cured pork belly with currants. very nice and tasty although i would have preferred the outside of the pork be more crusty with the inside moist. it was still very good.   for entrees we had the scallops with lobster dumplings and the kubota pork chop with 5 spice and hoison sauce.  both dishes were amazing although the pork chop was the best. we were a little disappointed that the scallop entree came with two scallops. for that price we'd expected more but they were tasty. we also had the glazed carrots which were spectacular.  a good selection of wine rounded out the dinner.   for dessert we had the pb bomb. incredible. and it was sized perfect to share after the meal.   if you haven't been there it's worth the visit for a romantic dinner.</b_review>
<b_review>the food has always been pretty good. tuna was excellent.  service was good but the guy never smiled-must have been having a bad day.  always do dinner around 5-6:00.  it is a very beautiful and romantic setting.  worth it for special occasions.</b_review>

<text>their bone-in-filet is amazing! it ruined every other steak that i have had in the past. the outside was crispy & salty while the center melted in your mouth like butter. the lobster mashed potatoes were creamy with huge chunks of lobster. asparagus was cooked to perfection.  finish dinner off with a butter cake. i often will skip desert from other places just to grab a cake to go.  when you go there, ask for your waiter to be tobias. he was wonderful and did a wonderful job with a++ service.</text>
<u_review>polo fundito with extra sauce! yum. every time i come here, this is what i eat. it's hard to stray away from something so good.  the margs are fantastic too!</u_review>
<u_review>the food is great! i can eat at this place over and over again. great pad thai and cashew chicken! consistently very good.</u_review>
<u_review>i went to this place with a bunch of friends. after 8pm sushi is 1/2 off. also, buy a beer or saki and your appetizer is 1/2 off too!  sushi was very fresh and tasty. the three of us had a variety of rolls and every one of them was great. too many to name.  i'll be going back again!</u_review>
<u_review>this place is good when i need a quick fix for pizza, grinders, and wings. all three are pretty darn good.</u_review>
<b_review>ok, i'll admit it, i am a bit of a steak snob. you see, for many years i was a vegetarian and now i am making up for lost time- with yummy steak. long story short, i send a lot of steak back for being over cooked. i don't like it raw, just cooked right. medium rare- warm pink center. not a crazy way to order a premium steak, no?   the worst offender for overcooked beef is capital grill, hands down. not necessarily the cap grills in the valley, they are actually pretty good. beware of the capital grill in detroit. come to think of it, beware of detroit in general. but i digress...   saturday night i had the most perfectly cooked cow i can remember. a chunky delicious cut of meat with a seared crust and a very perfect center. i did not have the sides that night, but they are great. drinks are plenty big and the bartenders know how to make a perfect rob roy which is a plus.   finally, i think this location makes it even better. it is occasionaly a little crowded, but most of the time it is just about right. enough folks around to make you feel like you are out on the town, but not so many you feel like you are at a middle aged college bar.   to mastro's- well done! uh...i mean medium rare...</b_review>
<b_review>this is as best as it gets! when my dad come into town this is where we always go as our tradition. it might be the only time i can get to go (a teacher's salary will not pay the bill here) but i look forward to it every time. the food is amazing, the service is the best in the city, and the atmosphere- especially if you get to sit in the bar area is the best! highly recommend!</b_review>
<b_review>"you're not allowed to have more than 3 martinis."    that was our rule for the bachelor, which we reminded him repeatedly during the 2 hours we were at mastro's.  we were in phoenix for his bachelor party and didn't want to relive his last mastro's experience in beverly hills which consisted of four martinis, little memory of the evening, and an $80 cab drive back from beverly hills to pasadena.    this mastro's is, like the ones in bh and costa mesa, dark, swanky, modern and upscale.  but, there's something a little different.  the costa mesa one is a little too hip for its own good, but the decor here fits the clientele.  it's scottsdale for pete's sake - it's not that hip.  the martinis are huge.  they'll fill your glass to the rim and give you the shaker which has almost enough for another full martini.  the steak i had here (bone-in ribe eye) was much better than the one i had (bone-in ny strip) at costa mesa.  it came a little underdone - i asked for rare-medium rare - but that's much better than even a hint overdone.  still, it had good flavor, was well marbled, and came with a nice crust.    the sides are nothing home to write about.  don't get conned by the lobster mashed potatoes.  it's a gooey mess of potatoes with overcooked pieces of lobster.  the other sides are fine.    we had 3 bottles of the 2004 chateau montelena cabernet  (napa valley).  the mark-up was about 100% of retail, but the wine was good.  rich and vibrant, solid fruit and nice acidity.    most of the us (there were 10) were very happy with the food and the service was very good.    if i could give 1/2 stars, i'd give it 3 1/2.</b_review>
<b_review>wonderful meal.  my wife and i went to mastro's to celebrate our anniversary.  highlights include the scallops appetizer, shrimp cocktail, bone in filet, creamed corn, lobster mashed potatoes, and the famous butter cake dessert.  we were a bit disappointed in the caesar and chopped salad, but everything else was absolutely wonderful.  great wine list and perfect service.</b_review>

<text>i went to last night's kick-off preview of the lady with all the answers.    although i knew that i was going to see a show that was based on the story of ann landers, i didn't know much more about it than that.  nancy dussault did an incredible job in this 'one woman show.'  i truly felt like i had an intimate evening with ann landers!  as much as i entertained myself growing up reading ann landers' column, i never really thought about her own life... although she was 'the lady with all the answers,' she had a life also - and you'll learn all about it when you see this show!  i don't want to spoil too much for those of you that will go see it.  (it's showing through november 30th, so definitely go if you can!)  i will however say that the acting is fabulous, the set is extremely well done, costumes believable, etc... i'm sure it's tough for one woman to hold the attention of a theater full of people, but dussault did an outstanding job with it.  i will admit, it was slow at times, but overall, impressive, believable, and fun!    as i walked out of the show with my friend, we discussed the show a bit.  we both felt like in the (just less than) 2 hours we spent at the herberger, we really got an inside look at who ann landers was.  we laughed, i almost cried, we participated a bit, saw some some fellow yelpers, met some new ones, and just had a really good time.    whether you grew up reading ann landers' column or not, you'll enjoy this show.  arizona theatre company did it again, and i can't wait for the remainder of the season!</text>
<u_review>yay - a ftr for gabi k!  located on market street at dc ranch, autostrada is the latest concept in chef aaron may's "collection" of unique restaurants in the valley.  autostrada, which means "an expressway or highway in italian" serves cuisine from all around italy.  with a capacity of less than 50 inside and another 45 outside, it's small, but the design which includes glass, steel, wood and concrete, gives this hot new restaurant a sleek, industrial vibe inside which goes with the theme very well.  i had the opportunity to attend a pre-opening dinner at autostrada last night... i believe they will be open to the public in the next few days.  i cannot be tough on the restaurant, as it was their first night open, and i was extremely impressed nonetheless.  we waited a short while to get seated, but it was a pleasure since the bartender, erica (aka red for her red hair) was sweet, attentive, and knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and the menu.  they don't have their complete wine / drink menu going just yet, but i learned the majority of the wines will come from italy, and they will also be offering a wide range of cocktails.  we enjoyed a pinot noir and cabernet while we waited.  once seated, shanda took care of us... for our antipasti course, i went with the cauliflower soup and j chose the caprese tower.  in addition to these starters, we quickly made friends with the couple next to us, and the next thing i know, we're sharing their cheese plate - hey, nothing wrong with that, right?    next up, i had a tiella casserole of grilled veggies including eggplant, zucchini, parmesan cheese and a zesty tomato sauce - it was delicious! and j's fettucini with scallops and mushrooms was pretty amazing as well.  we could've stopped here, but we kept going.  for the segundi course, i chose the sea bass and j had the veal... this is where autostrada has a few kinks to work out, but remember, it's their first night open... i didn't love the fish - wasn't a fan of the cold veggies on the plate or the sauce which came on the fish.  the veal however, was fantastic - and i'm not usually a veal fan!  it was served on polenta - yum!  our new friends at the table next to us chose the steak and the halibut... and again - steak was a hit while the fish dish - not so much.  we finished with the dessert that shanda recommended, the crepes with chocolate and strawberries... omg they were scrumptious.  as you can tell, we had a lot of food... and our bill proved it coming in at around $100 before tip.  but, we had a lot of fun, made some new friends, and found several other menu items to go back for next time we're in the dc ranch hood... plus, autostrada will be open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner seven days a week.    with the casual environment, friendly attentive staff, and the magical management/ownership team behind autostrada, i'm sure they will be a success.  buon appetito!</u_review>
<u_review>i had a blast at skeptical chymist last night... thanks again to the yelpers that came out for trivia - although 'team yelp yourself' didn't win any major prizes, we sure had fun!    i love the atmosphere at sc - so laid back and the staff is friendly as can be!  i wasn't sure i'd be able to find a light bite to eat (i was expecting heavy irish bar food), but i was pleasantly surprised and i really enjoyed my house salad with salmon. i sampled the curry fries from kelly b and dare i say they were the best i've had?!  i would go back just for those!  delicious!  both items went well with the strongbow apple cider too. thanks again, jolene (my waitress) for your recommendations!  i look forward to checking out live music at skeptical chymist another time soon... or perhaps returning once i brush up on my trivia knowledge.  either way, i'll be back for sure!</u_review>
<u_review>jade palace on pinnacle peak in north scottsdale was my "go-to" chinese place for years... so when i moved to old town, i felt a bit lost and haven't been able to find consistent chinese nearby ever since.  i've recently found a few options in phoenix, but after a recent take-out experience with friends and last night's meal dining in at this jp location, i think i may become a regular!  we met my parents for dinner here, and everyone was pleased with the meal.  service was spot-on, atmosphere was fine, drinks were cold and refilled often (the beers even came with chilled glasses), and most important, the food was fabulous!  i took charge of the food order for our party of four but allowed everyone to chime in of course.  here's what we had:  appetizers:  *1 large order new york egg rolls (2 total egg rolls but we had them cut in half so each of us had a half... delicious!) *1 large order bbq spare ribs (8 per order)  entrees: *lo mein noodles with shrimp and (extra) broccoli *dry sauteed string beans (1 small order) *house specialty #9 (kung pao three delicacies) - sea scallops, jumbo prawns, and sliced flank steak in kung pao sauce *mu shu chicken   of course, this was all served with plenty of white rice as well.  we ate almost everything, and the only negative i can say is that unfortunately, we didn't have leftovers to take home!    another perk for this location? sweet republic is in the same shopping center, so if you save room, head over there for dessert!</u_review>
<u_review>when my previous laser lady stopped answering her phone or returning messages, i took jillian and abu's advice and went to see cosmetic laser solutions...  i was 100% pleased with both cindy and kristine (i've since been back a handful of times for touch ups).  they are both personable and perfectionists when it comes to hair removal.  i found the pricing pretty affordable as well.  i may even go in for a peel of some sort after the wedding - i'm starting to see sunspots on my face and they are not pretty!  if you're in need of laser services of any sort, give these ladies a call!</u_review>
<b_review>atc brings professional theater to tucson and phoenix!  we are so fortunate to have such a wonderful organization at our finger tips.  i have seen several shows and have never been disappointed.  most recently i saw [title of show].  i think that it was my favorite thus far.  i was even fortunate to go on a night that included an opportunity to speak with the writers.  i love that they offer extras like that.  they seem to have lots of educational opportunities.</b_review>
<b_review>i received a much appreciated invite from phoenix's lovely and talented community manager, gabi k. "come watch this play with us!" i looked it up and replied, "well, it looks like something my girlfriend would love, but it's better than sitting in my hotel room alone."  yeah, yeah, not the most rousing of endorsements; along the same lines as "it beats a poke in the eye." lest you think me an ungrateful prick, however, let me just say that i had a good time. sure, it wasn't my kind of show or my kind of crowd, but i'll get into that. but the short of it is, i'm glad gabi invited me.  so what kind of crowd was it? based on the mixed aromas of chanel no.5 and ben gay wafting through the air, i'd say the average age of the room was just north of deceased.  being originally from florida, i'm very familiar with the concept of god's waiting room and this, dear yelper, fit the bill right down to the "number being served" sign. these folks were old!  (how. old. were they?!)  well, they were so old, they told columbus to get off their lawn.  they were so old, the hill they were over eroded years ago. they were so old, they thought john mccain didn't have enough experience.  and did i tell you the crowd was a bit on the older side?  that's ok. knowing that the play was based on ann landers, i expected this. it's not anything i'd hold against the theater, the play, or the crowd themselves. and at least they didn't spend the entire show messaging their friends on their phones, if only because it's kind of hard to text using a rotary dial. so good for all of them for getting out and getting some culture in their lives.  the theater was quite pretty. based on the yelp reviews i read of the herberger, i was expecting some ramshackle community theater. instead, it was a full-fledged playhouse with comfy chairs, balcony seating and sponsors whom i've actually heard of.  i bought some beer, but seeing as how i was still bloated from dinner, i opted for the bud light. since a new seasonal brew had just been delivered, the bartender mocked my choice of beer. i stood there and took it, because the selection deserved mocking.   the play was well-acted and well directed. the actress, nancy dussault, sold her role as ann landers to the point that it took me until half-time (sorry, the "intermission") to figure out that she was mrs. rush from two close for comfort. there i sat, feet away from someone who spent years with jm j. bullock and she didn't appear to show any lasting effects. therapy and pharmaceuticals can indeed work wonders.  in all, the play worked and even my cold, black heart moved a little. infinitesimally to be sure, but even i could appreciate the work put into creating a show like that. and the audience agreed as those who could stand quickly, gave a standing ovation.     so four stars to the arizona theater company and to my fellow yelpers who made my business trip to the desert just a little more enjoyable. thanks all.</b_review>
<b_review>i watched daddy long legs about two weeks ago.   the story was so heartwarming, beautiful, and romantic, as if you are watching a jane austen's novel coming to live.    the two actors were magnificent.  i hope they will return back to atc.  there is not a bad in seat in the house at the herberger theater.  a major plus is that you get in/out of ladies room during intermissions before the performance starts again.   thank you all for a fantastic evening!</b_review>
<b_review>i went to my first ever atc play "dr. jekyll and mr. hyde" last night  and it was a fun experience.  i dragged some friends with me and we made it a classy night. classy with a c, that is. they are a great local theater company worthy of praise.  i found the adaptation featuring four different hydes (incl. a woman) to be very entertaining and compelling.    the credentials of each of the actors were impressive and while there were moments of cheese in the acting, overall the acting was pretty decent.  the man in front of us bailed after the first act, so i guess not everyone shared that opinion.  the crowd, like most performing arts audiences, was much older on average, so if that's not an issue for you, you should enjoy it.    our comped seats were much better than i expected.  i thought i was gonna be in nosebleed heaven, but we were in the 12th row of the orchestra section.  not bad, not bad. i wish every comped ticket in lyfe was that good.</b_review>

<text>as a huge fan of greek food, i am always looking for something authentic, something skin to the mediterranean snack bar where i grew up, burning my little fingers on the hot dish which held my often craved spinach casserole. i sat on tall chairs with my mother, my legs dangling as i looked around at the small restaurant. the meat on a spit, the bright blues and whites of the decor. the tempe location of mbfgr gets one more star than the chandler location, but then my review of the chandler location was damn near scathing, so that's not saying much. to make an honest comparison, i ordered the same thing: the chicken souvlaki pita. this time i went with the side salad, which was full of bright colors and fresh looking. the food arrived in good time and the chicken was tasty, if lukewarm. the service was friendly, even if our waitress forgot to bring pitas. mbfgr just does not come close to my childhood memories, but then that was new york. i agree with melissa h. that everyone can find something that they like. the food is so americanized. at least they could serve it hot. if anyone has any authentic greek suggestions...?</text>
<u_review>i have been to cheuvront a couple of times, but this time was my first actual meal here. i had just finished a big exam and really needed a glass of wine. mel had the open faced tuna steak sandwich, wich was beautiful but a little difficult to eat. thick slices of avocado and thin slices of sear ahi tuna on a ciabatta roll. she said it was delicious. i ordered the grilled cheddar cheese. it was exactly what i wanted- melty, cheesy, and sublime. i paired it with a glass of kim crawford sauvignon blanc, which i reccomend. it's a fruity but crisp white and it really hit the spot. this is a great date spot. this is the place to go for a new wine suggestion. i'll be back soon.</u_review>
<u_review>well i'm glad that i had a heads up about the location. it was a little difficult to find. after taking my family on what seemed like a wild goose chase to find this gem, and after almost giving up, we found it. we were seated inside and enjoyed the ecclectic surroundings while perusing the menu. i had read some other reviews, so i ordered the veggie scramble with green chilies and a mimosa. their coffee was delicious, the scramble was outstanding. the service was great. i loved the atmosphere. i'll be back to try something different.</u_review>
<u_review>i have since been back numerous times and i have had fairly consistent experiences. sometimes the cream cheese icing seems more buttercream than cream cheese, but that does not often happen.  i do have to say that the chai latte served is fantastic. i may not know cupcakes, but i do know chai.</u_review>
<u_review>this place is chill. we like to come here to chill. service is great- they always have suggestions for patrons. the atmosphere is cozy and eclectic. the artwork ranges from interesting to what-the-hell-is-that? there are some nights where there is live music- i wouldn't suggest comig here to chit-chat on those nights. come for the music.</u_review>
<b_review>good, sensibly priced, and healthy lunch options.  goodbye to the heavy kronos branded gyros of the food court.  one and a half opa's to this place.</b_review>
<b_review>this is now my favorite restaurant on mill. i had never been to a greek restaurant before today and i loved it. my friend got the village hummus here which was absolutely delicious. it comes with some delicious, warm pita bread. i'm definitely going back just to order it. i ordered the mushroom burger and it was huge but so good and the greek salad it came with was also super yummy. we sat up and ate at the bar and the bartender was totally adorable and a sweetheart. i'm looking forward to eating here again in the future.</b_review>
<b_review>love this place. yes, the name is quite cheesy, but if you can get past that, you'll find some seriously good greek food. i always order the famous gyro dinner. it comes with rice, potato's, and the gyro meat with pita bread. the potato's are to die for. they are roasted with some type of lemon herb mixture, and the rice is as well. the pita bread is sooo tasty and fluffy and just amazing, and the gyro meat is fantastic...not too salty or dry. the spanikopita appetizer is delicious as well.the service is great too. our waiter remembered us from our previous visit and joked around with us which is always nice. i would definitely recommend this place.</b_review>
<b_review>good atmosphere and good food.  the garlic fries are very good and the falafel is solid.  the mill location is fun as is the location in chandler.</b_review>

<text>hard to give an airport a bunch of stars but sky harbor is alright in my book.  i always get through quick.  can't wait for the renovations to finish and the new concessions policies to go in place.</text>
<u_review>not sure the food could be considered authentic. but, the carnitas yucitan were exactly what i wanted.   they were very tasty with a perfect amount of spicy.   service was ok, and chips an salsa were average.</u_review>
<u_review>lunched here monday.  had read all of the reviews, so expectations were high.  and they lived up to them..  about the place.  family run, mother/daughter combo.  the son handles the web site and twitter posts (check twitter for daily specials).  they were very nice.  the mom kept bringing me food i didn't even order, just because i told her i would eventually try it.  the food:  i ordered a 3 item combo.  i was really only hungry enough for a 2 item, but for the sake of all of you, got the 3 so i could taste one more dish.  the chicken adabo was very simple and good.  won't overwhelm you with flavor.  it is prepared using chicken wings, and they were hot and tender.  the spicy orange beef was very good.  daily special i believe.  very flavorful, with a hint of orange and red peppers.  also tried the beef mechado, which i am told is one of their better burritos.  the potatoes that accompanied this surprised me.  i expected them to be a bit mushy, but they were perfectly crisp.  i chose mexican rice to go with it, but i believe they have garlic and white rice as alternatives.  they also gave me some of the cassava cake.  i am not a huge fan of coconut, but i tried and enjoyed it.  also, they brought out a small sampling of their most popular item, the pork egg rolls.  they were almost like deep fried taquitos with a very unique flavor.  served with sweet and sour, it is a must have!  they supposedly have to make 3,000 per day!  go try it out.  no soda fountain, so you can get canned soda and drinks.  eat in (cute decor) or take it to go.  not great for large groups, but 2 or 3 would be ok..</u_review>
<u_review>i had a sandwich that contained all of the following:  steak chicken bacon cheese jalapenos other stuff  it was, in a word, freaking amazing.  the hot sub of the day is almost always my choice.</u_review>
<u_review>lunched here today..  i cannot recall what the place used to be called, but it was something else last time i was here..  anyways, i digress..  the decor of the place fits right along with what you'd expect based on the size and menu.  friendly and open, just keep the party small, this place is crowded!  food was ok..  they pride themselves on all of the farm fresh veggies, but they overwhelmed the salad with dressing.  people usually want a salad to be healthy, not loaded with an abundance of dressing.  you could taste the fresh apples and cranberries, but the spinach and celery were totally wiped out..  i did get a soup to go, and i will have it shortly, but it is unlikely to change my rating.</u_review>
<b_review>i've flown in and out of here more times than anna nicole smith's pharmacists flew in and out of the bahamas. i find the inside extremely easy to navigate while the outside a labyrinth of epic proportions. what lane do i exit to the 202. the left? oh, now the middle? and then 100 yards later the left again? wtf? is this fun for the traffic monitors as they scarf down cheetos and dr. pepper all the while watching weary travelers zig zag the ridiculous signage. services are average to pretty good in terms of bars, restaurants and shops. not sure what the complainers aren't finding. all i need is a bar, a snack, the boob tube, dramamine, the national enquirer and that funny horseshoe shaped pillow that makes me feel like an idiot everytime i bring it out.</b_review>
<b_review>it's one of the better airports as they have plenty of places to plug in you phones & etc.. and free wifi</b_review>
<b_review>ok airport. layout is fine - food choices vary across terminals; in mine, not great choices. clean & bright. conveniently located to suburbs around phoenix. it works -</b_review>
<b_review>i liked that they had free wifi. other than that i don't really have anything to say about this place. it's big and i was only there for an hour or two. the only store i went to was starbucks to get a smoothie because i was dying from walking across the whole airport to get to my gate. i didn't bother to go to any of their dining areas since i already packed food.</b_review>

<text>this is my favorite stadium to watch a spring training game. maybe it's because i remember watching the firebirds play here and well the tickets are cheap. i even get a $2-4 discount with my credit union debit card.   they sell nathan's hot dogs! yum! they also have margaritas and snow cones. you can't go wrong with either.   the views here are amazing although trying to get into the parking lot sucks. great location. not too far from tempe or south scottsdale.</text>
<u_review>yeah, i saw someones ass hanging out of their basketball shorts (must have been laundry day cuz he didn't have any underwear on), but that's part of the adventure.   i hate driving downtown (ok, i hate driving in general) so this alternative is a dream come true. the carts were clean and we didn't have to wait long for one to ever come by. we didn't have any problems and it stopped for a light maybe 3 times from the end of the track in mesa to downtown and back. we got on and off about 3 times and we never saw anyone checking tickets even when it was packed and standing room only.  i can't wait until this thing runs until 2 am next month so we can check out some more places downtown and in central phoenix.</u_review>
<u_review>came here late one night and my boyfriend and i shared dinner in the bar area. we ordered the lasagna and it was just enough for 2. in all honesty, i think he would have like to eat more, but i was hungry too so he couldn't have it all to himself. it was delicious.   we were looking at the pictures they have hanging in the bar area and noticed that two older ladies that were sitting in the bar area having drinks and dressed to the nines, were also pictured on the wall. this must be the spot for local celebrities!  :p    i'll definitely have to come back here and try something else from their menu.</u_review>
<u_review>i never knew this place existed in the middle of the city. i saw an article about this place in the paper and we decided to come and check it out.   it doesn't take very long to watch the video, walk the park outside and check out the museum inside. it was pretty neat and i'm glad i checked it out, but i was a little bored.</u_review>
<u_review>i've been here quite a few times for after work drinks with coworkers since it's just down the street from where i work. it's an ok place, but with 4 peaks just on the other side of the parking lot we usually tend to pass on this place.   we went yesterday and it was a disappointment. we got there before they started charging a cover (at 4 pm) otherwise it would have been $10 to get in. i'm guessing that this was to pay for the limited tables, chairs and one tent they rented. also the band who was singing "your body is a wonderland" and something else by snow patrol. also they were charging $6 for drinks. it was just a little ridiculous. it was pretty much imposable to get drinks or food inside, which those of us who have tried their food before, weren't big fans of anyway. and to top it all off they closed rubio's next door.   a funny sight were these two ladies who brought a little girl who looked like she was 6 and 2 babies who didn't look old enough to walk. the moms' had a beer in one hand and were each pushing their stroller with the other. i know times are tough, but it you can afford buying a $6 beer, you can afford getting a babysitter.</u_review>
<b_review>a small, tidy stadium for the a's.  parking lot available (most recently for the 2012 season $5) across the street from the stadium with a walkway overpass to get people to and from the p-lot/stadium (handicap accessible).  there's some shady seats available and plenty in the sun.  bring a jacket if you sit in the shade, can even get a bit chilly!    as for the food, the most important part of baseball, there didn't seem to be  huge selection here.  i think on one end there were some sort of chow mein available (weird) and then the main specialty seemed like the bratwursts and the hotdogs fresh off the bbq.  get the footlong dog!  so delicious and probably the most worth it.  i didn't try it but they also have fresh brewed ice cream!  anyway, get the dog!</b_review>
<b_review>phoenix municipal could get four stars in my book solely because it's home to my team, the oakland a's. but, i can't just base a review on that so i'll explain some other traits that makes it a four. like the oakland a's stadium back in oakland, this stadium doesn't have all the bells and whistles as other spring training stadiums, but it has character and houses many memories for all. parking is close and seamless, but it can be a bit of a hassle to walk from the lot to the stadium on warm days.   food wise, they have a couple options; the typical ballpark food complete with hot dogs and peanuts, a lemonade stand, frozen treats as well as a bbq area.   seat wise, the stadium has a good amount of shaded and sun seats, so you can either get a tan on or cover up the farmer's tan you're creating while watching the teams play. you can tickets for a relatively low price or you could dig into your wallet a bit more for great seats.   i love to spend many spring days sitting at phoenix municipal and watching my athletics play!</b_review>
<b_review>this is the home of the a's during spring training.  the stadium itself turned 30 this year, but there are a few things that have been renovated, and a few things that have not.  let me start with parking- i got there a few minutes late, and that was a huge no-no.  especially on opening day.  when i say i parked in the absolute furthest corner of the lot, i wasn't kidding.  a guy even offered my buddy and i a rickshaw ride to the stadium.  i told him thanks, but i knew it would have killed him (thats like hauling 500+lbs across a huge ass lot).  this helped out near the end, as an exit was readily available (thank god!).  on my way to phoenix, i had the pleasure to sit next to a beautiful woman who ended up apparently being a gf of a sp for the a's, this intrigued me.  i told her i would wear a lin jersey and an a's hat, and wear them to their first two games.  should be easy to find.  i guess i wasn't easy enough to find?!  i was still intrigued now to watch the a's (she reminded me they picked up coco crisp and manny ramirez, 2 classics).  i have no idea how, but i somehow managed to get 2 tickets via ticketmaster the morning of the game, 6 rows behind home plate, on the aisle.  this was awesome, since we sat next to tons of scouts (thanks for the radar reading!).  this was also the game that manny ramirez debuted in an a's outfit- too bad he hit a groundball out (and then i think he disappeared, or maybe that was me).  he is one of my fav's of this era.   the actual park is smaller than most, and it shows.  no outfield seats (just ads and ads and ads) or lawn, so that kind of sucked in terms of confinement around the park (but like i said, it is 30 years old).  the seats were bearable, even with all of the crap the scouts had (aka their bags and such).  it's a nice ballpark, but i think they should consider putting a lawn in the outfield if they would like more of a crowd- they have the space to do it!  i do love how the beer is much cheaper in az than it is in elsewhere (only $8 for a 24ozbeer) for games... i usually have to get a 2nd mortgage to get a beer in ga!  if you still have the energy after the game, the zoo and botanical garden are literally down the street. even 2 parks- great way for a fun day!</b_review>
<b_review>we went here for our first a's spring training game, and had a great time sitting by the a's bullpen in the sun. the stadium is definitely a bit old and worn down, but the food was decent and the beer was cold. i hear the a's are moving to mesa in 2015, so not too many more chances to see them here.</b_review>

<text>kawaii just opened a few months ago. i've been there more than five times since.. it's just great! the atmosphere is quiet and they have unique tables that have double sided seats. so you are close to the people eating around you. their food is fresh and affordable! they have a daily lunch special where you can get 3 rolls, a salad, and miso soup for $11!! and you have a list of 15 or so to choose from. if you purchase a beer or sake, you get a $.99 appetizer. the waiters are family and work every day and they are the nicest people i have met in a while. five stars!</text>
<u_review>i really want to give zpizza 4 stars, but it's just not a 4-star pizzeria. their veggie pizza is the best out of any 'delivery' i've had but doesn't rival cibo or even sauce.    the upside: good veggie/vegan options. - you can opt for the whole wheat crust for no extra charge (the gluten-free crust is a $3-4 upcharge).  -their california veggie and moroccan eggplant pesto pizza are divine.  -there's an ice cream parlor next door. - their iced tea isn't awful.  the downside:  the service. - we always order and pick up -- and are consistently on hold for more than 5 minutes, often times having to call back because they hung up.  - there are a few people working at this location who clearly hate their jobs. their attitude and manner is really unpleasant to be around. i get it, you work at a pizza place and you're not that happy... but why take it out on the customers?   i came in the other night and watched a guy stand in line in front of me for about 8 minutes (he was already there when i arrived), while the girl at the front was on the phone. there's another register.. yet no one came up to help him. he ordered slices and by the time i told them what i was picking up, added a slice and got my drinks, he was still waiting. this poor guy waited 20 minutes just to get 2 slices of pizza that was already premade and in the case! that's just careless service.</u_review>
<u_review>sidebar has a great atmosphere with unique and really comfortable furniture, great choice of alternative/indie music and ridiculously good specialty drinks. they have random movies playing without sound for looks and the bartenders are super nice. love it!</u_review>
<u_review>hula's always get's mixed reactions from people i meet. they either hate it or love it.   i have converted.  my first experience at hula's was not the best.. so i wrote the owner a letter. he comp'd my next meal and has recognized me since. their service is great.  i've only come here for brunch -- so that's the reason for 4 stars.   $2 mimosas? yes please.  my favorite favorite item on the brunch menu: ahi tuna eggs benedict. amazing. i dream about it. best!</u_review>
<u_review>we use bertha's at work for lunch catering and they are always on time, affordable and delicious.  i always make sure to order myself an additional sandwich/salad combo when they deliver.  so to start, bertha's is fantastic.  some of my favorite sandwiches: roasted turkey pesto chicken roast beef and blue cheese chicken curry  their harvest salad and thai chicken salads are also fantastic.  i'm a fan!</u_review>
<b_review>wow. today was my first time eating here and i thought it was really good! now, i have never had an actual meal in japan, but from all the americanized crap i've tasted, this place is amazing. i live really close to here, they have takeout, and the stir-fry soba noodles were awesome! seriously, i think they deserve some kind of reward for that alone!  but, i see that some other people see that the miso soup is a microwave packet, but i've had microwave miso before (it was disgusting!) i think whatever brand they're using is really good. i don't think anyone should be fooled by the bad reviews, if you just like asian- inspired food, might as well try it!</b_review>
<b_review>gosh... maybe it was because it was a friday evening, but it was packed. though we quickly got seated in the corner bench, we actually had to put our hands high up just to catch their attention. i swear, if we never spoke up, they would of just ignored us until closing time. however, the food was still amazing, i just recommend to go on a weeknight or when there's nobody there.</b_review>
<b_review>if you want to eat some good sushi without a big crowd, check out kawaii.  i've been about 25 times now (i live very close).  i always get a saki bomber becuase then you can have an appetizer for only $1.  right now, when you buy a specialty roll, you get a regular roll for free.  i haven't had a roll there i didn't like and i usually finish a beer before i can decide what to get.  besides the sushi, i get the yaki udon.  it's great.  it will be even better once the temperature gets cooler.  for dessert, you've got to try the fried green tea ice cream!  it's making my mouth water just thinking about it!  the service is good too but don't be surprised to walk in and catch a some of the staff just watching tv.  it's probobly because you're the only customer there.    see ya there!</b_review>
<b_review>we went for lunch and arrived at 1:15pm.  one man at a table, one at the sushi bar just leaving.  while we were there, two girls came in, two guys came to the bar and one solo at the window.  so the crowd was pretty sparse. first - the service was fine.  the young lady had a rough time with english, but she really tried.  the two males were better on english.  and all of them checked on us every once in a while. the food was good...certainly not great.  it was obviously fresh.  i had the three rolls for $11 special, jo had a chicken teriyaki special for $11.  chicken was a little on the dry side - she would have preferred dark meat.  my rolls were good and the price was fine. their techno-pop music seemed way out of place, especially when they had the us hockey team on one tv. all in all, i'll go back.  but, do note that all the "happy hour specials" require you to buy a beer or sake.  one drink for every special you order.  ehhhhhh</b_review>

<text>pho tai here was a-ok  was happy to see all the condiments around as well as fish sauce. (sriracha was in a generic plastic bottle instead of its namesake package)  a strong force in pho-land in pho-enix would like to see some more noodles/meat to bump it up to the level of sf pho places.</text>
<u_review>gave this place a try and what you get is the average run of the mill pho joint.  the servings of meat are on the low side though...  my pho with rare beef seemed mostly soup, luckily one of my friends only finished a quarter of their fried rice   service: average food: average prices; average</u_review>
<u_review>this place was aight,  $4 beer specials were a pretty good deal but the sole reason i'm not rating this place any higher is because of the food. (better options at 4peaks and santan)  it was underwhelming and overpriced~ the ambiance of this place was nice though  had the oyster po boy and well.... if you want seafood i guess one should move a bit closer to the w-coast.</u_review>
<u_review>great location, gorgeous rooms was very grateful to be in such a place.  rooms came with a fully stocked kitchen, two bedrooms, and two nice flat screens, and a bathroom with jacuzzi and were spotless.  the concierge and the staff were quite helpful and the surrounding area and malls have everything you need in a 5-10 min car ride radius. the business center was also quite helpful for printing my grand statistics homework (a travesty that my break was spent sorting that out but never mind about that).  overall a great place to spend break.   oh yeah free fast wi-fi (always an underrated perk)</u_review>
<u_review>a lot better then subway for sure, great for late nights.  and they have dijon mustard   tried #16 turkey club  jjblt  makes me wonder why the location in my hometown is always empty...</u_review>
<b_review>so i came to meet a friend around mekong plaza and she recommended us to eat here. i love pho, and usually don't have any complaints. i had the rare flank steak, and friend had the seafood pho (this one isn't on the menu, but if you ask, they'll accommodate!) . she enjoyed hers a lot, and mine was a-ok, i'd say i've experienced better ones, with more flavorful broth, and thinner-cut beef.   however, the service was outstanding!! our waiter was very attentive, and made some good recommendations that made me wanna go back for some other ones!</b_review>
<b_review>the young lady that helped us was very friendly and the flavor of the pho was good. just right across the street from my work-out place and so yummy!</b_review>
<b_review>unphogettable is awesome...other than the name being quite unforgettable, the food and service is too! their food is delicious. great flavors and  really fresh. they definitely take the time to get to know their customers and teaching them about how to properly eat pho. you might be wondering what i'm talking about but there is a way to mix the sauce in the tiny bowl to dip the meat in etc. anywho, the price is alright, i think its the typical price per plate but totally worth it.  definitely try the shrimp spring roll. one word: heavenly!  bottom line...i recommend this place for those who love great service and unforgettable pho! ;)</b_review>
<b_review>i like it! the broth was great. they give good portions of pho noodles and meat. service was great. i think the lady liked it when she found out that i was vietnamese. =p all in all another great pho place to frequent while i'm here in mesa.</b_review>

<text>this walmart is in my "hood" and i will seriously only shop here if i'm desperate and can not wait until frys or target opens.    dirty store - check wait 30 minutes in line to check out - check need to "hire" someone to do some work for you - check ( a quick scan of the parking lot, and you'll find your workers ) some woman smoking "something" in a bathroom stall - check   ( "security" proceeded to kick her out of the store within minutes of someone narcing on her.  i was standing in the customer service line waiting to get a refund when everything went down.  you could her her yelling from outside the bathroom. )  i will drive my happy azz 8 miles to mesa riverview's walmart than drive the 1.5 miles to this location.</text>
<u_review>i am beginning to think my colleague and i are jinxed when it comes to the 2 of us going to lunch together.  just went here to grab a quick bite - or so i though it was going to be quick.    3 people working at this location.  1 person manning the register and trying to fill orders.  what the other 2 people were doing, i have no clue.  but they sure werent helping the lady out.</u_review>
<u_review>if i could pick up all of j's rx for him (some of then you need a photo id for), i totally would have him transfer all his meds to the scottsdale and osborn walgreens by my work.  this walgreens pharmacy sucks that much!!  fin.</u_review>
<u_review>this michael's sucks!  we were there friday night to get a few craft items for the baby's room.  i also needed some items to make my baby shower favors with.    it was pretty busy when we got there.  but was there a team member around to answer questions?  nope!  2 workers were in the store...total....from what we saw.    after trying to figure and locate eveything on our own...with no luck.  j and i dropped all the items we had and left.    we should have just made the drive to joann's in scottsdale.</u_review>
<u_review>a friend/co-worker had been trying to talk me into going to noodle ranch for months.  especially since i had gotten pregnant and had experienced a few weeks worth of morning (all day long) sickness.  well this past friday, she finally twisted my arm enough into going.    i've had pho at a lot of different restaurants.  i've had pho so much so, that i got burnt out on it a few years back.  hence, my reason for not really wanting to check this place out.  you've had one pho, you've had'em all.    we both ordered the pho ga ca rau xanh (pho chicken, broccoli, and baby bok-choy)  the noodles were about par for pho noodles.  the broth was as standard as any pho broth.  there was hardly any broccoli and baby bok.  you're paying .75 extra for broccoli and bok, so i expect to see quite a bit in my pho.  also, they only brought out 1 small plate (about the side of a bread plate) for the two of us to split of the bean sprouts, lime, chili pepper, and thai basil.    you'd think if both of us are ordering pho, we'd both get a plate.  i will say though, the bowl was huge.  after having a few spoonfuls of the broth and bites of noodles, i ended up just eating the broccoli, bok, and most of the chicken.  we split an order of the spicy pork vietnamese springrolls.   now, those were awesome!  the rolls were nice and stuffed.  the dipping sauce that they come with, spicy and slightly sweet.  throw some chili paste on them and they're perfect!  if i had known that the pho would have been such a disappointment to me, i would have ordered the springrolls as my entree.    will i return?  i think so.  but just to get an order of the spicy pork springrolls.  :)</u_review>
<b_review>it's unfortunate that this is the closest walmart to me because it is literally the worst walmart ever! not only is there always a line because there's never enough employees working but you can count on some idiot in the 20 items or less line with more than 20 items! did i mention the clientele is horrible?! whoever manages this walmart needs to open their eyes! ::written while waiting in line at this very walmart!!::</b_review>
<b_review>this walmart has been here for a while now. never too spetacular at all. but, when you need something cheap and you need to now this is the place to go. now i am not talking about shoes and clothes, or jewelry. i mean things for you car, house,fixing things you know.  you can get good deals on things you just have to watch what you are buying here. it is always packed, a lot of these people seem to be just milling around.  but, oh well. come in pick up what you need and get out. it is a big store , but it always seems a bit dirty. the parking lot is always packed. it is good for me to stop in every now and then because, it is right next to home depot.</b_review>
<b_review>ok so normaly wal-mart is just another trip to the store, but today i was greeted by someone other then the greeter and had a nice conversation about the holidays.  then the gal at the self check out station was veery nice too, and attentive to all her registers.  the store seemed clean the selves where stocked.  i am very pleased with the invproments to the store keep it up</b_review>
<b_review>if you go here during peak hours, expect to spend a minimum of 30 minutes waiting in the check out line.  the place can get a little grimy at night time when undesirables are the most active.  i avoid this place if i can, but it's open 24 hours, wide aisles, and usually stocked well.  the best time to get in heavy grocery, or other shopping would probably be early in the morning.</b_review>

<text>asian fusion food.  very busy, usually a wait for dinner.  the food is above average, but the decor is very cramped.  with the usual crowd, this is not a place for a sedate dinner, but its central location makes it a nice place to eat before doing something else in the area.</text>
<u_review>above average steak house.  both this one and the one on camelback.  enjoyed the steak.  not my favorite in phoenix, but i would definitely go back there.</u_review>
<u_review>this spot has several different venues under one roof.  there is country bar with line dancing, a current dance club, a 70's/80's dance club, a karoake bar and a pool hall.  the place is huge, with good drink specials.  have had a good time every time we've gone.</u_review>
<u_review>i cannot believe i haven't reviewed this.  one of my favorite restaurants in all of phoenix.  the casual atmosphere, helpful attentive wait staff and the wonderful bartenders make this a location which really reminds me of many of the restaurants i used to frequent back in new york.  the owner, bobby is very personable, and takes an active interest in his customers.  i've had most of the dishes on the menu, and never would rate any of them less than a five out of five.  on the appetizers, some of my favorites are the mussels, the frito misto and the stuffed mushrooms.  on the entrees, i've had chicken there every way they have on the menu, from cilantro to ste. marie; all four veals; both steaks, and every seafood dish.  all are delicious.  there pasta dishes are to die for, as are their calzones and strombolis.  their cold sandwiches are delicious, but i've only had 2 of their hot subs:  philly and meatballs, both of which were delicious.  i would be remiss if i didn't give a special shout out to their bar menu.  wow.  i haven't had everything on it, but most of them.  the strip steak is delicious, the open faced ground round is huge and perfectly done.  the butterfly shrimp, grilled chicken breast, scallops, and italian sausage are all fantastic.  i go there a 3-4 times a month (only jade palace gets more visits per month as uncle sal's - and i eat out a lot).  but when i first started going there, i had been there about 3 times for lunch, and as i walked in, the bartender, mary anne, remembered me, my name, and what i drank.  love that in a bartender.  i've been there for lunch, for dinner; with my son, with a group; for business meetings; for special occasions; i've sat inside, at the bar and outside.  never been disappointed.</u_review>
<u_review>this is owned by the same people who own ocean club up in kierland.  great food, very good service.  wonderful ambience.  the steaks were excellent.  i don't know about the best steak in the valley, but definitely one of, anyway.</u_review>
<b_review>i have been here 10+ times over the last 3 yrs normally the food is decent im part of the lunch crowd so i cant speak for dinner but my sesame chicken lunch special yesterday was mediocre half of the chicken pieces were so over cooked the were hard and dry some of the other pieces were better but not perfect ,service was good</b_review>
<b_review>really enjoyed this place this was the second time we visited this location  it is so clean and comfortable  waiter was very nice and attentive timing of the food was on point drinks were very good validated our parking  prices reasonable  mgr was a young lady with a very sweet accent that came to our table to say hello and i thought that was just so nice  we will be back !</b_review>
<b_review>big location, lots of seating, and great outdoor area.  yelp check-in offer, free order of dim sum - edamame potstickers, yum!  chicken fried rice, yum yum!  northern-style ribs, triple yum (you knew that was coming!).  why wouldn't you come here - it's always great and consistently good!    justin, bartender - fun, and extraordinarily nice!  late night happy hour - yay!  when the nights in az are as lovely as now, in the 70's --- sitting outside is supreme!</b_review>
<b_review>pf chang's ain't bad.  granted, it's not the best food i've ever had but there is a lot to like about this chain and the food is of good quality.  i like the following:  1.  the lunch bowls are really inexpensive.  you can get a decent lunch bowl and soup for like 8 bucks ($7.95 to be precise).  that's pretty cheap, man.  i mean, come on.  8 bucks rarely even buys you a 12-pack of beer anymore.  2.  the to-go containers are awesome.  i bicycle around and, to date, no hot soup has spilled down my back.  it snaps together and, voila, you're good to go.  3.  overall, it's pretty fast.  if you work close to a pf chang's, call a little bit in advance, get it to go and, man, you're set.  sometimes the people who work at this location think too highly of me and don't realize i'm a fatass.  i'll order my food, the lunch deal and sometimes two spring rolls and they'll give me two forks and two fortune cookies (actually i got three fortune cookies today).  they either think i'm ordering for two or that i need two forks to shovel the food into my mouth twice as fast.  if i were ambidextrous, i so would.  celebrity sighting!  i saw frankie muniz outside of this location, too.  i looked at him as he walked by and i was like, "is that the kid from malcolm in the middle?"  i cocked my head like a dog who heard a whistle and he looked a little panicked, like he thought, "ah shit.  this guy knows who i am."  i didn't say anything cause he was with his chick and i had to fart.    but, hey, frankie, that sweaty guy who had to fart used to watch your show when he was in school.</b_review>

<text>this hard rock is really nothing special. it is much smaller than most of them and doesn't have any really spectacular memorabilia in it. still, it is a good place to get souvenirs that say phoenix and very convenient to downtown sporting events. food and service are ok.</text>
<u_review>the food here is consistently good. i am not really a sandwich person so this is not my favorite place to go. but it is a good option for lunch while at the chandler mall. the sweet potato sandwich is my favorite and i also really like their soups and pastries (good for breakfast too, scone and a coffee, yum). i agree with lynn w. that this place is much better than paradise bakery.</u_review>
<u_review>well spinato's has become our favorite pizza place since we discovered it thru a friend a few months ago so i think its time to write a review. the ahwatukee spinato's is a pretty nice location but the best part is that we live within their delivery range so we can get their yummy pizza whenever we want! they do have a delivery fee of $2.50 and it usually takes 45 minutes to an hour to get the pizza. so, not quite as convenient as pizza hut or other chains but they do have the fancy online ordering available on their website so that is pretty cool.  they offer both a thick crust which they call sicilian style and a think crust. the thick crust pizza is sort of like chicago style but not really since it is not so heavily loaded with cheese and toppings. it is a lot of bread but so yummy. my favorite pizzas are the here's the beef (steak, caramelized onions, and gorgonzola, yum!) and the margherita but those are both good for the thin crust. since the hubby likes the thicker crust we usually get it with half the signature (garlic sauteed spinach-so good!) and then half the combo or chicago (both have italian sausage and lots of veggies). i've also tried the canadian and that was amazing, too. it works pretty well with the pineapple because their sauce is somewhat on the sweeter side. they do use a lot of red sauce but i like my pizza that way.</u_review>
<u_review>this is a pretty good mall.  they don't have all the super upscale stores that some of the scottsdale shopping centers can offer like barneys, neiman marcus, etc but it is still a lot nicer than many of the other malls in the phoenix metro.  it is always clean and the parking lot is well lit and has security.  they have all the basics with a few boutiques thrown in.  i like the fact that they do have a nordstroms but also a sears.  the food court is pretty basic but they also have other dining options in the surrounding area like kona grill, cheesecake factory, pf chang's, etc.  they also have a harkin's movie theater which i actually look at as a minus since it means the parking lot is just that much more crowded.</u_review>
<u_review>for some reason i had never been to this restaurant even thought it is right across the street from where used to work so on my second-to-last day with the company i went there for lunch with a couple of my colleagues. we each ordered two mini burgers and also got a couple of sides to share. the smothered tater tots came out first. these were a big hot mess but in a good way. so yummy! we also got the mac and cheese which was pretty flavorless and very disappointing. but my friend said she had gotten it before and it was much better. for my two burgers i had the buffalo which had a delicious sweet sauce on it and the lamb burger which was equally delicious. both burgers had an incredible amount of flavor both in the meat and the toppings. i would love to eat my way thru the whole menu! the service was very lackluster, our waiter seemed like he had somewhere better to be, but other than that i liked the vibe of the place. it looked like they had a pretty good beer selection as well so it seems like it would be a great choice for happy hour!</u_review>
<b_review>i had a great chicken club sandwich and the price was a little bit pricey. i believe that it was because of the "brand name" hard rock café and for their profits. i enjoyed the meal. it was short walk distance from the conference center.</b_review>
<b_review>if you like terrible service and overpriced food you've come to the right place.  if i knew before i went in there i would be paying $16.00 for macaroni and cheese, and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it, while my glass remained empty, i would've stayed away (which is what you should do).  food wasn't awful, although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a "rock" bread on their sandwiches. the mac n' cheese was nothing special.  the service was beyond poor.  first and last time i will eat at hard rock cafe.</b_review>
<b_review>food never disappoints - usually go before a phoenix mercury game.  like their mac and cheese ! a little it expensive, but it is good.</b_review>
<b_review>great service. the local legend was tasty and filled me up. poplano pepper, pico, fried onion strips and a thick burger! the tomatillo sauce on the side was ok but not really my thing for a burger.  good location after a trip to us airways center across the street.</b_review>

<text>i accidentally stumbled upon last chance looking for another store, and i had to share my experience on yelp.   i walked into the store and saw a small indoor mall, took the escalator down and stumbled upon a mess of ravenous women who were on a mission to get as many pairs of children's shoes as possible. i heard a loud voice screaming over the crowd (by a worker) "everyone step away from the shoes and don't touch them until we restock!"   i have to admit that at this point i was scared, but intrigued at what was inside this store that would cause these woman to behave in this manner.   now, i will admit, there were some amazing finds. i saw very high end designer shirts for less than $10. but, i have to agree with other 2 star reviews in that these clothes are pretty gross.   i probably will not return. for those of you who have not been and are reading reviews, the best i can compare this mad house is a 50% off sale at goodwill. but, about 50 times worse. i have also seem similar behavior on christmas eve at grocery stores in mexico (and in a food city in downtown phoenix) by the meat department.   you have to be a pretty dedicated shopaholic to deal with these crazy women.     p.s.- parking is terrible in this shopping mall.</text>
<u_review>haven't eaten at the farms restaurant. we went on mothers day and the menu seemed a bit pricey.   but, we did shop at the farmers market (bought bread and some produce.) then we sat down on the picnic tables and had a wonderful brunch eating what we had purchased at the market.   there is a neat art studio towards the back of the farm. staff was very friendly and helpful.   there is a cool chicken coop that the kids can walk up to, the garden is right by the market which is an education tool for teaching our city kids where food comes from.    this farm inspired my family to put in a large garden and raise 3 chickens in our backyard.   it is great for an early summer morning outing with the family.</u_review>
<u_review>is a bar in an ice skating rink a good idea?  i'm not too sure it is, but i had no idea there was a bar when i took my kids here.  i noticed there were a bunch of adults sitting behind glass, but i thought they were just being lazy parents.  crap!  i think i may have done better skating had i been a bit tipsy.  oh well, next time!  i had a groupon that was about to expire so we went on a saturday during open skate.  there were 2 birthday parties going on at the same time so it was pretty packed.    i noticed that to pay for the skate assist walkers, you had to go inside the shop, pay, and then go out to the skate rental to get the walkers.  we had to wait 20 minutes to rent them because when we went to pay, there wasn't any available and the guy working the counter wouldn't take our $ until some were turned in.  the problem was, everytime one was turned in an adult would hurry to the rental counter saying they had paid, and they were just handing them out without double checking.  i finally had to convince the kid at the counter to just let me pay for it and i would stand at the rental counter and wait.  if it wasn't for my morals as well as setting a good example for my kids, i would have done the same thing as everyone else.  paying $5ea for 3 kids to have walkers, when everyone else was getting them for free kind of sucked!   my kids loved this place.  they had a lot of fun, and it was a cool break.  other reviews said to bring gloves, sweaters, etc...  i didn't have the experience of being extra cold.  in fact, it was pretty warm, and no gloves are needed as long as you don't fall down.  i agree, with other reviews that the ice isn't as smooth as it should be, the building is old and the facilities are shabby.  the outskirts of the rink are dirty and cluttered.  there is nothing nice or fancy about this place at all, but i would go back again because my kids had a good time and it was reasonably priced for skate time and rental.  cheaper than going to the movies, and healthier for the kids.</u_review>
<u_review>i am an avid shopper of healthier food stores. whole foods, trader joes, and sunflower are always on my list of go to places when i grocery shop.   so, when a friend told me how great fresh and easy was i had to stop at the one down the road. of course, i read the yelp reviews 1st so i was excited to go.   i have to say, i was disappointed. although very cheap, the quality of the produce was substandard. i can get better quality at wal-mart (not that i would.) i didn't try any of the "easy" meals, as none of them looked appetizing, and to be frank, i can make healthier options at home. i did find a handful of cheaper versions of things i purchase at other stores, which was nice, but overall not worth the extra stop. the price was right but the quality wasn't up to my standards on most of their items.   fresh and easy is a healthier option over a chain grocery store, but it is definitely not a cheaper version of the quality you get from the "healthier" grocery stores.   a positive note: the staff here is very friendly and are always there to help.</u_review>
<u_review>4 stars for the beer and atmosphere!  2-3 stars for the food.  i was scouring yelp trying to find a fun place to take some out of town friends who were here from indiana.  i wanted to show them some fun in our spring desert.  i finally decided on four peaks.  park on the street and it is a quick walk.  saw that a few cars had recently been broken into as there was a lot of glass on the side of the street, but we didn't have any issues.  the patio was very nicely shaded, and with a slight breeze on a march afternoon it was perfect weather.  i was surprised that we didn't have to wait to get seated on a very busy day.  the waitress was attentive (at first) but slacked once we ordered our drinks.  it was a busy saturday afternoon and we were having a good time, so the slow service didn't bother me.  i tried the kilt lifter and a friend tried the stout and both were delicious.  they have a "full bar" but they don't have blended drinks.  a friend ordered a cosmo that she said was decent.  later that evening i found the kilt lifter on tap at a local bar, so it was an added bonus to be able to drink the same beer all day.    the food was mediocre.  if there wasn't so much grease on everyone's food it would have been a lot better.  i ordered the turkey club on marble rye, and the bread was too greasy/buttery to enjoy.  a few friends ordered burgers and fries that they enjoyed after using there napkin to soak up some of the grease.  i will try to jalapeno popper burger next time and will ask them to not add butter or toast the bun.  someone else in my group ordered pizza which came out hot and looked like very fresh ingredients were used.  we ordered the nachos as an appetizer and they were just ok.  big plates made it possible for almost everyone to take extras home.  all in all, we had a good time.  the beer and the atmosphere is why i will return to four peaks on a sunny afternoon.</u_review>
<b_review>"imagine black friday every day"  shopaholics be very careful when reading this review.  in the world of rejected, returned, and slightly irregular clothing comes a place where several ambitious name brand clothing are given their last stop before being cast into the abyss of donated clothing.  last chance brings new life to fashion that never made it to their destined owner by offering it at fraction of the retail cost. the catch is matching that orphaned clothing with their new owner.  shopaholics will have to endure the separation anxiety as their article of clothing is in the hands of another owner.  you will have to overcome aggressive shopping from children and old ladies determined to fine their item.  the only limit is what is imposed by the shopping policy at the door and what is posted throughout the store.  you can see families strategizing before their purchase like watching another sequel of ocean's 11.  you'll have to plan for a line even though this store is the size of any ross store, there are 15 eager registers waiting to cash in your purchase.  i know clothing and fashion quality are popular and current as the shoppers demographic are similar to those at the biltmore fashion park or scottsdale fashion square.    as a shopping experience this is not for the faint of heart, but watching women putting their hunting skills into practice when shopping is only an experience you'll have to witness yourself.    if you find this review funny, useful, or cool please check below.</b_review>
<b_review>three words: "get here early!!!" i can only tolerate last chance once in a while, when i "have the feeling."  the store and crowds totally drive me nuts with all the disorganization and pushyness of other patrons but you can get some really good deals- as long as the stuff isn't damaged, which a lot of the merchandise is.  so if you're a bargain shopper that's down with being overwhelmed and have a lot of patience, this may be a good find for you.  call me an anxious snob but last chance is just a little too much for me!</b_review>
<b_review>don't come here looking for anything specific or you'll probably be disappointed because it's a mess. you've got to have patience and scour over the racks because things are usually scattered outside of their designated areas. yes, people here are crazy. just get in there and join the crowd. maybe you'll get lucky and find a great deal. makes for good people watching.</b_review>
<b_review>last chance is literally nordstrom's hand me downs last chance. first there is nordstroms, then nordstroms rack, and then last chance. with that in mind last chance has a very thrifty feel. i would not recommend coming here if you are looking for something specific. i wouldn't even recommend nordstrom rack for that. another thing to know is it is always busy busy busy. only go to last chance if you are energetic, optimistic, and can handle disappointment if you don't find anything. it's truly hit or miss!</b_review>

<text>i've only hiked camelback once, but i felt so accomplished (albeit winded, and mere minutes away from passing out).  we started the hike at 6 in the morning, and got to watch the sunrise while we made our way up the trail.  i thought it wasn't going to be a bad hike, but things get tougher about two-thirds up.  things starting getting vertical at some points, and i wasn't really prepared for that.  it was totally worth it once we got to the top, though - gorgeous, 360 view of the phoenix metro area (and really, much more than that).  and watching the sunrise with someone special is pretty awesome too.</text>
<u_review>first, there's a $10 discount on the entire fixed menu during happy hour, which (i believe) runs from 3-6.  if posh is usually a little out of your budget, this can be a life-saver, especially if you're going for the 4-course.  it kept our bill under $100.  book a seat at the chef's table.  we both loved watching all the different dishes being prepared and being able to ask about the ingredients and dishes.  the chefs were more than willing to answer questions, and would sometimes check in about our preferences about ingredients before prepping our next course.  if you have a particular food fetish, tell someone!  i happen to adore truffle oil, so i let our server know, and wrote it in the "other things we should know" section - and they specially prepared me a dish with truffle oil.  which inevitably led to a foodgasm, and a foodgasm always leads to an extra star.  another star for comping us the foie gras course, after i saw how beautiful/delicious it was, and wished (out loud) that i'd just dropped the $15 to the chef - he was such a sneaky charmer about it, too, and the server was practically beaming when i gushed over how delicious the dish was.  it was awesome to see everyone taking such pride in pleasing my palate.  everything was perfectly executed, and completely delicious.  if i were rich, i would come here once a week.    as it is, i just have to satisfy myself with waking up in the middle of the night, imagining the perfect interplay of the smooth, creamy foie gras with the spun sugar and berries.  (also, the post-dinner cookies and lollies are also amazing)</u_review>
<u_review>15 minute wait.  bam.  we started off with the spiedini, which was delicious.  we did a half-and-half rosa and wiseguy, and let me just say, it was amazing.  new york pizza was screaming at me, bitter and betrayed, and i ignored it because i was busy having a freaking love affair with that pizza.  i'm still thinking about it right now...  not in a creepy way.  in a foodie way.  we ended our charming meal with some really amazing cappuccinos.  and did i mention the 15 minute wait?  oh, i did.  twice.</u_review>
<u_review>open straight-through from friday morning to 11 sunday night -- that alone garners three stars for sheer convenience, dedication, and unexpected awesome.  it makes xtreme bean great for meet-ups and conversations.  another star is earned because all the baristas know what a dirty chai is, and are generally really nice about comping if you ask for soy.  that's actually almost a star-and-a-half, to be perfectly honest.  my only gripe is the bathroom being disconnected/outside -- it's a coffee place, the large could literally eat your face -- pissing is bound to happen regularly and copiously over the course of the four hours you're bound to be there.  the study-spaces, free wi-fi and laptop lounge put the whipped cream on the proverbial soy vanilla latte.</u_review>
<u_review>yes, it's totally crowed to the point of insanity on first friday, but that's not the only time it's open.  the location is very convenient to the roosevelt row crawl, and the building is super cute.  lots of great local wares, clever books, and adorable cards.  i always see the perfect gift for whoever i'm shopping for - whether or not it falls into my price range?  totally different story...  definitely a solid go-to spot if you're trying to find that perfect vegan cookbook, sweet-but-not-obnoxious baby onesie or little handmade card to say thanks to that friend who brought over an excellent bottle of wine to your last party but you forgot to tell her how totally awesome it was.</u_review>
<b_review>camelback is easily one of my favorite places in phoenix. i'd highly suggest going right now, because when my husband and i hiked the echo canyon trail on saturday it was gorgeous! all the rain has turned the mountain green -- well, as green as it will turn. it is still a desert, after all. anyway, there is grass and weeds and wildflowers and moss all over- it's like a new mountain!  the one thing i don't get about camelback, however, is how every time i do it, no matter how many times i've done it before, my legs still ache like hell the next day. oh well.  in addition to the great workout, hiking the mountain exposes you to a great slice o'life. i've seen it all here -- flabby men hiking in speedos, little chihuahuas that ascend this thing faster than i do, helicopter rescues, girlfriends nearly breaking up with their boyfriends because they don't want to go all the way to the top, and people from all over the country, and the world, who make sure to hike the mountain while they're in phoenix. very cool.   there is one minor annoyance i have with this place -- and that's the people who hike the entire thing, up and down, at a regular pace... then run the last 5 minutes like a bat out of hell. you're not fooling anyone, toolboxes, we all know you didn't run the whole thing. quit pretending, and quit knocking me off the trail!</b_review>
<b_review>dear joe the water guy, thank you for your water.  thank you for noticing my wobbling legs and suggesting hydration.  you may have saved my life today!    i loved this experience!  i prepared myself for kind of a shit show seeing as most of the reviews agree that saturday morning may not be the best time to take on the summit for the first time.  i had some issues finding parking as i decided to hike after an intense yoga class which brought me to mcdonald road around 9:45 am.  to my surprise it really was not too busy!  i did park a ways away as suggested my my fellow hiking yelpers which allowed me to get up to the mountain as other hikers waited in their hot rides for someone to make it down the mountain.    pros: great cardio, amazing view, nice hikers (mostly tourists...especially on weekends),   tips: bring a lot of water.  (i am thinking of investing in one of those backpack water things)  if you see 'joe the water guy' (this is literally what he told me his name was), say hi.   to make life easier, just park down the road and walk the 1/4 mile.  this will save you time and will allow you to burn a few extra calories...</b_review>
<b_review>absolute great place only minutes from our house. so pretty and just plain fabulous. you don't have to plan much, just a pair of shoes, sunglasses, and water....and you can be done in under an hour to get the rest of your "chores" done for the day.   but beware of dog owners who don't know etiquette and hikers who have the headphones up too loud....they won't hear you coming up until you literally have to sprint around them (at which point they usually act completely shocked that you didn't try to ask them for a pass).</b_review>
<b_review>this was my first time hiking, ever. i was told echo canyon wouldn't be hard. so i went up with a friend. we were lucky to find parking in that small lot fairly quickly. we made it passed the incline where the rail is available for assistance if needed. i saw a lot of people not use the rail and figured i could do it. my friend was at the point of vomiting. so we ended up going back down. after watching a youtube video of someone completing the trail, i want to go back up and go all the way before i leave arizona. i wouldn't say echo trail is hard. you just have to be aware of your surroundings. there is a lot of dirt and sand around that you can easily slip on. some girl did roll her ankle. the funny thing was the rescue crew looked like they were getting winded out making their way up to the injured girl. make sure to have both hands free just in case. i made the mistake of carrying my water in one hand all the way up. this mountain tail makes me want to try the ones back home to see how far i can get.</b_review>

<text>i was a big fan of lis doon varna, the original restaurant that the building was built and housed for some years before its untimely closure earlier this year. it was the most authentic irish restaurant i've been to in arizona (see: *most*, though it couldn't be labelled *an* authentic restaurant) and i was really sad it closed. i thought i'd give the building's new owner a try and i can't help but compare it to lis doon on every level. the inside is completely the same - they must have acquired all the furniture and fixtures along with the unique building. they seem to have added some random photos and things on the wall (framed ink-jet print-outs of the kennedy family add a touch of class) to make it theirs but it's mostly the same.  the menu is where things get really different. johnny fox's menu is a lot smaller and a lot less irish. the prices (a bit on the expensive side) are about the same but it seems like it's all the usual "pub food" you find in "irish" restaurants around phoenix. nothing original here and it makes me sad to see things like alfredo sauce covered pasta on the menu. i opted for a cup of the shrimp bisque and the sausage roll appetizer with a bottle of magner's while mom went for the cottage pie (misnamed sheppard's pie on the menu) and house white wine. the bisque was very good and came in a small casserole dish with a handful of soup crackers on the side. the sausage rolls were awesome though i'm not sure what type of "sausage" they used - seemed a bit hot doggy but still tasted good. those were filled with onions, mustard and baked in pastry dough and went well with my cider and bisque. the cottage pie wasn't anything special but was also good. definitely not worth its $14 price tag, though. i could make better at home for around $5 in ingredients (and who gets the idea that food originally devised for poor people by poor people can be over $10 a plate?).   service was decent though the waitress was super perky. pro tip for customer service: if you're giving way more than you get back, maybe tone it down a bit. it just puts the customer off. we were also served the wrong table's plates  and the waiter said, "ugh, *someone* is putting the wrong table numbers in!" obviously referring to our waitress. very professional. the food also took awhile (the food wrongly served us would have been about the right time for restaurant food, but ours took another 15 or so minutes after that -  i could only assume ours had been served to someone else) though the waitress did pop by to say our food was on its way instead of leaving us hanging.  over all, i will very much miss what lis doon varna was and will not be back to this restaurant. the décor alone is just simply not enough to make it worth my time. i'll keep a look out for some real irish fun here in the desert (though i'm not holding my breath).</text>
<u_review>this place is great to go in and have a look at the plethora of neat toys and candy they have... but that's about it. the prices are way too high and a lot of the items aren't things you can't get anywhere else. they also have a real lack of imported candies/chocolate which is something i would drop more money for. be prepared to buy more than you wanted if you only have plastic - they have a minimum of $6 to use your card so i had to buy two sodas i didn't want in order to get my handful of candy.  with all that said, this is a really nice, unique local business and i love the idea behind it, but i don't have a lot of free cash to spend on a bag of gummy bears i can buy at circle k for $2 less. this is definitely a place for gifting only and not just when you want something sweet to eat.</u_review>
<u_review>typical mexican fast food place. got the carne asada fries to go and they were really good - tons of meat with guacamole, cheese and sour creme. it was a to-go box full of fries and toppings for under $8 and it filled me up, which isn't easy!</u_review>
<u_review>while the prices are a little high (if it wasn't for happy hour, i would have blanched at the prices) the service was very friendly and the food was good. we got three hh plates at $6 each - chicken street tacos, fuego nachos and the meatloaf sliders.  the meatloaf was a little spicier than i could handle (i'm really sensitive when it comes to hot spices) but the nachos and tacos were awesome.  three plates and a margarita came to about $26, with the nachos being the best deal. i wouldn't go out of my way to get here but it's a nice spot downtown.</u_review>
<u_review>after i wrote my initial review, the owners emailed me saying that holiday hours were on the website. while i didn't see them when i went before, i could have been in a hurry or just didn't know what i was looking for. please do not base your opinion on my original review but try it for yourself. however, i still think a sign saying that they weren't open at that time and why would have been extremely helpful, especially when they still had the original hours posted on the gate.</u_review>
<b_review>summary: great food but avoid this place on the weekend because the kitchen and wait staff can't keep up.  we were seated for a good 15 min before anyone came to our table. it was obvious that it was chaotic. it took 20 min before we had drinks and a good 15 min wait between courses.  i don't blame this on the waitress completely because they were understaffed in the front of the house as well as in the kitchen.  my husband and i have been there twice. once we had mussels for an appetizer (yummy) and today we got the smoked salmon platter (very good).   after telling the waitress that we were starving, it still took forever to get our beet salad. the tomatoes could have been a little fresher and the salad could have used a little less oil, but we have also like this enough to get it twice.  for dinner, my husband and i ordered the same thing both times - he had braised lamb shanks (gunormous!) and i had the bollycotton (seafood pie with a delicious cream sauce and flaky crust).  for dessert we had a buttermilk tart that tasted more lemony that buttery, but was a good companion to the bailey's and coffee.  i wish that a manager had come by or at least we had been offered a free dessert or something, though. the excuses from the waitress about everything from the bartender to the kitchen to the computer gives me concern about how well the place is organized. i hope they can improve the service because the live music and environment is something we really enjoy.</b_review>
<b_review>awesome. great patio setting and great beer. food is really good as well. go for the fish and chips. patio gets loud when there is a band.. but it is a bar so..</b_review>
<b_review>finally went to check it out in the afternoon and really enjoyed the food.  i was expecting a new decor from the previous lis doon varnas but nothing had changed. the atmosphere on a sunday afternoon was a bit blah but the food was good.</b_review>
<b_review>after my favorite bar down the street closed down, we needed to find a new place to grab a quick beer. i think we found it.   we've been here a few times before but always at really odd hours on really odd days when it's slow. we finally came in early on a saturday night and it really shows what this place is made of.   our bartender was really personable and he was able to have quick, relatable conversations with all of his customers sitting at the bar.   the selection is mostly irish (lots of scotch, whiskey, irish beers,etc) and we've never tried the food, but the atmosphere is friendly and it's a great place to get together with friends.   service is the main thing here and they have it down pat.</b_review>

<text>great lunch specials. but they add a gratuity of their choosing to to-go orders and will not remove it.   shady as hell. won't be back.</text>
<u_review>i want to love massage envy. and in fact, considering i've been a member for at least 4 years now, you'd think i definitely love this place.  but i don't.   well, actually this location, facilities and people are a-ok. it's the silly guidelines set by corporate that are apparently forcibly followed by this and every other location that just drive me mad.  for example, my most recent membership was initiated from a location in dc. so because of that i will forever be a dc member despite no longer living there. so i get no reminder calls, no appointment reminder calls, and cannot get my billing corrected without calling dc. and i know i'm not the only one with the perpetual annoyance of having to deal with 2 offices on separate sides of the country for billing. i've heard at least 3 others at the counter talking to practically a wall in trying to get their account properly transferred (here's a tip-i've tried 3 times and i've finally accepted that it will never, ever, ever happen).   my regular masseuse is absolutely ahhhhhhhhhhhhh-mazing and worth waiting for, even though she has hours that are entirely incompatible with my work schedule. love her!!!</u_review>
<u_review>the smell!  what the hell!?!?  so this is my first foray into fresh/easy shopping and i was met with an overwhelming smell of....something.  maybe it was coincidental and client-based.  maybe it was something outside.  but all i could think was omg is that the produce or meats they're selling??  i ended up getting some packaged fresh green beans and a thai rice heat and serve meal.  both were fine (hence the extra star), but the odd smell will certainly keep me away in the future, at least from this location.</u_review>
<u_review>came here while a robbery was in progress.  the cops asked me why on earth i would have come here alone (at 9pm, no less)  avoid at all costs, unless you need more excitement in your life.</u_review>
<u_review>they have reallllllly hot miso soup!  i know that because the last time i was here, our waitress poured half of my miso in my lap. with no apology. and no offers to comp the soup that probably has left my ovaries unable to function.   but hey, she and the other staff are pretty so that's all that matters, right? nobody cares about service or basic manners anymore, right?</u_review>
<b_review>mediocre food coupled with subpar service. got turned down for sake bombing at "sakebomber". not to mention the interrogation at the front desk to be served alcohol. definitely will not return.</b_review>
<b_review>disclaimer: i like sushi. i don't love sushi. i don't crave sushi. when some one mentions that we should go get sushi, i am usually pretty neutral. when i get to a sushi place, i am excited about sushi. i always order too much sushi and can't eat it all.   i've been to sake bombers twice now and thought i would throw together a review. all in all, it's a bit better than average. i'd probably give it a 3.5 if i could.   it's a far cry from traditional sushi, but that's fine with me. in fact, my favorite thing we got last time was the chimichanga roll that had chicken in it and some killer salsa to dip it in. the more standard rolls are good as well and the girl likes it and she's got much better taste in sushi than i do.   price wise its very reasonable for sushi and if you want a good place to knock back a few for a nice low price, the aptly named sake bombers definitely fits the bill.</b_review>
<b_review>pro: having a sushi bar across the street is great, and the drinks here are relatively cheap (especially during reverse happy hour)  con: carding me at the door while i'm on a date and making us wear wristbands is about as tacky as it gets. and the sushi is nothing to write home about.</b_review>
<b_review>great service . . waitress was very nice . . the chiefs interacted but the food was terrible.   i sent the spicy tuna role back because it tasted old.   the rest of the food had bad flavor.   they need to get some senior sushi chiefs before you go . . these guys are not good.   i love sushi and i have eaten a lot of it . . all over the .world including japan .. this place you would be better off going to the grocery store.</b_review>

<text>i'm not really sure how this places survives in this economy. it's overpriced with poor service and the food is mediocre at best. stopped by today for lunch and we weren't even sure we had a food server it took him so long to get to our table. he was "rushed" through the whole meal.  when we asked him questions about the meal he acted like it was an imposition to answer our questions.  items we ordered:   glass of white french wine, iced tea, bowl of french onion soup, basiled chicken and brie sandwich, chicken salad, creme brulee for dessert.  our bill came out to 57.83.   this meal was not worth that price.   on the menu it stated the chicken salad had basil in it.  when i received the salad no basil.   i even asked the food runner if it had basil and she assured me it did.   i informed the waiter and he agreed they omitted it.    bread is also not automatically brought to the table.   you must ask for it otherwise you're out of luck.   food was also on the salty side.   i would not recommend spending your hard earned money here.   there are better places with great food and service for the price.</text>
<u_review>stopped here for lunch yesterday. i've been to the one in scottsdale but i think this one is a tad better. had the spaghetti and meatball special. on "meatball wednesday" you can get either a full size meatball pizza or a full order of spaghetti and meatballs for only $7.95. it did not disappoint. they do have lunch specials for $8.95 between 11-2 daily for either a half salad with soup, sandwich or 8" pizza. you get a choice of salad from about four different selections: chopped salad, veggie salad, caesar salad or strawberry gorgonzola salad.    the pizzas are gourmet type pizzas with unusual ingredient toppings such as pistachio's, fennel, potatoes.   give this place a try.</u_review>
<u_review>i have to say i am a little picky when it comes to fast food burger places.  my husband had been to five guys many times and kept asking me to try it.  i finally agreed and was not disappointed.   they burgers are great.  lean , fresh, meat, not frozen and most importantly not salty!!   most burger places rain salt on their burgers, not so at five guys.   in fact i even asked for my burger "not seasoned" and the cashier explained they do not season their burgers.  you can get as much of any topping for no extra charge.   customize it any way you like.   the orders always come out accurate.   fries are great and always come out hot and fresh.   i have been here several times and will continue to go back.   give them a try.</u_review>
<u_review>if you like sugar and bread combined then this is your kind of place.    stopped in for lunch recently with my husband since we were craving a good sub sandwich and was hoping firehouse would deliver.  in my opinion it failed miserably.   i ordered the "firehouse hero sub" which includes smoked turkey breast, virginia honey ham, roast beef, melted provolone.  hubby had the "new york steamer" which includes corned beef brisket, pastrami, melted provolone.     we ordered both subs "fully involved" which includes mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a dill spear on the side.    when my sub was delivered they forgot the mustard.    the sub looked good but that's where it ended.   the quality of the meats was just terrible.   the virginia honey ham was so sweet i thought i was going into glucose overload.   that's all i could taste of the sub.  sugar!!   granted a honey ham can be a little on the sweet side but not like this.   husband's sub had no flavor.   simply poor quality meats all the way around.   you can get a better sub at fry's or basha's using the boars head meats.   i would not recommend this place.</u_review>
<u_review>have been going to sweet tomatoes for years, both at this location and the location on 75th ave and bell road.   you can't go wrong at either place but this location has such a friendly, welcoming staff and the food is so fresh.  there is something for everyone at sweet tomatoes.   huge salad bar with a variety of prepared salads and build your own.   also, homemade soups and hot pastas.   muffins, focaccia pizzas, sweet and baked potatoes, cornbread.    puddings, jellos, fruits and frozen yogurt with various toppings for dessert.   they keep the salad bar spotless.   if so much as a crumb falls on the counter they are there quickly to remove it.  if you haven't already, give sweet tomatoes a chance.   sign up for their "club veg" and they will send you weekly coupons via e-mail.   also, they usually have coupons in the sunday arizona republic.</u_review>
<b_review>great food and classy feel.  walked in not knowing it would be a $200 meal for 2 but rolled with it.  stands outs were the charcuterie and cheeses.  good wine by the glass selection and a scallop dish that was seriously one of the best i have had in a very long time.  good eats at elevated prices but with great quality.  not bad for a monday, but even better for a romantic friday.</b_review>
<b_review>nice consistent casual french dining in  kierland shopping ctr.  top picks: crab crepes, scallops and shrimp in a broth,rock shrimp salad, duck confit sandwich, fries, house wine by the glass or carafe.   sit outside and people watch or they have a pretty cool courtyard patio when it gets hot but you want to be semi outdoors.  just watch out if ordering the boullibasse  is different than most, no broth and has a paste on top which i did not expect but they gladly replaced.</b_review>
<b_review>my wife and i had a 8 o'clock reservation at zinc.  we were ushered to a two top in the traffic pattern, easily the worst table in the room.  there were several banquets available and we were told noway, no how we are fully booked.  one hour and ten minutes later all these tables were still empty. our waitperson was efficient and officious.  we felt like we were more in a diner than a "fine dining restaurant".  i had the chicken dish - $28.00 for about 6 ounces of chicken, 2 ounces of risotto and about 20 green peas?  draft beers are served about 2/3rd of a glass at $7.00?  there isn't anything about zinc that is french except for the frisee salad and the attitude.  $140.00 plus. way over rated.  one plus, the ambiance is great.</b_review>
<b_review>i agree with a.b:  overly pretentious clientele food does not deserve the high prices snotty staff  i think the only redeeming factor for this place is the patio.  if you want french-inspired bistro food head over to coup des tartes. if you want real french food, go to vincent's. if you want to be insulted, overpay for your food, and regret your evening, go to zinc.</b_review>

<text>"you guys have any specials running tonight?"   "yeah 22oz domestic drafts for $3." "okay cool, i'll take a blue moon."   "that's not part of the special." "is it on draft?"   "yes." "it's made by coors."   "yeah, well."   so... it's not all domestic drafts. it's just the cheapa-- domestic drafts.  i can't stand stuff like this. the guy was friendly enough though.</text>
<u_review>ended up here before a rhythm room show because, as always, rack shack has the world's most bizarre business model and you essentially have to guess when they might or might not be open. if they're not open, head east down indian school a few blocks and catch stacy's. actually strike that. try stacy's first, because it's way better.  the place is simple and to-the-point. it has a true city vibe like you might catch in chicago or new york. it's not a restaurant that tries to be anything it's not, or tries to "create" a vibe with kitsch and pomp. no, someone just put up a chalkboard to tell you what's to eat, and put down some tables to let you eat it.  the eats are good so far. i got the brisket sandwich and sweet fries. the meat was very tasty and the fries were fresh and crispy. my only real complaint is that condiments are nowhere to be found. i would have liked ketchup and extra sauce for my brisket, since it didn't have enough for my taste. a nice lady walks out to the tables continuously asking how everything is and collecting empty baskets--i asked her but she must have forgotten. i would suggest they put condiments out so customers can help themselves. my associate got the same sandwich but with fried pickles and okra. i was skeptical on the pickles but they are actually really good if you like pickles.  overall, a great way to fill up before you hit the rr or char's. it's not quite over-the-top ringy-dingy five stars, but it's muy bueno (oh snap, here comes sheriff joe).</u_review>
<u_review>this little place does a great job pumping out fresh chinese food. it won't really blow you through the wall into the avis rental office next door, but it's above average. thus far we've tried several of the chicken and veggie dishes--they are all very good. the garlic chicken and mongolian chicken are favorites. pei wok makes everything fresh to order. there are a few clean, small tables you could sit at to eat (i think two two-tops and one four-top), but i always get it to go.  there are smaller lunch combos for a very cheap prices--cheaper even than going to panda express which is relative garbage. for dinner, you can get a "large" which is just white rice and entree, or you can get the "combo" which is fried rice, entree, egg roll, and cream cheese wontons. look, maybe a better semantic strategy was in order, but they do what they can.  the guys running the joint are also very nice and friendly. they always banter with me about my tattoos, the weather, or anything else that comes up.</u_review>
<u_review>best place around to watch a mainstream movie.  the prices are reasonable considering the costs movie theaters pay now to lease the prints. harkins still has a reasonable matinee price and even a movie that starts at 5:00 qualifies as a matinee. the concessions prices are, of course, outrageous. in case you don't know anything about the theater business, this is how they make virtually all of their money. they don't make anything from ticket sales.  the theaters are pretty comfortable, and we have always preferred them to amc because of the reclining chairs. they do a pretty good job cleaning the theaters between shows as well--there is very rarely any visible mess in the theater from the last show.  my only complaint is that they really need to get on some schedule of steam cleaning the seats. maybe they do this already, but they need to do it more often. the seats get pretty funky with spills, stains, etc. after a while.</u_review>
<u_review>a fun night out can be had here!  my wife and i went on a saturday night because we heard they have team trivia. when we arrived the place was quite busy because there was an ncaa playoff game going on. so, we sat and had a beer until the game was over and trivia started. it is not electronic trivia like you might be used to in some bars--they actually give you a pad of paper and they have a host reading out questions and collecting answers. i'm not sure if you actually win anything but it was fun nevertheless.  the beer selection is quite nice and they have several things you're unlikely to encounter elsewhere unless you really make a point to visit bars that have a lot of craft beers. the appetizers are pretty good as well--we tried the chips and salsa and one of their quesadillas.  this is definitely a dressed-down sports bar so don't put on your saturday best for a night out here.</u_review>
<b_review>the good: we absolutely love their wings and its becoming a regular for us to go every other tuesday for their wing deal. we always get the honey hot wings and share a side of either regular fries or the loaded fries.  the bad: i do feel the wings are a bit too pricey, even on the deal days. also, what is up with their high school hostesses!? they are incredibly rude and give dirty looks every single time we have gone, which is now around 7 times. someone really needs to put these girls in check. goodness. this is the reason for 3 stars instead of 4. i would actually give it 3.5 stars if i could.  we like the atmosphere and it always seems clean and the servers have been very nice so far.</b_review>
<b_review>seems to be going downhill. orders get messed up regularly and food quality is decreasing. it almost feels like they're trying to cut corners.   my last visit included terrible service with half of our orders (party of 8) incorrect. lunch service seems worse than dinner. i've been going here for years and it feels like owners have forgotten about this one.</b_review>
<b_review>while i have not eaten at this particular nny( i moved here from ny and is not that "native"...at all) it's 2 min away from where i live.food is meh at the other ones though.  i just saw devon review and i'm appalled and disgusted. if in fact it's  true, i will never visit this restaurant and will urge everyone i know to do the same as well. it is one thing to have different believes and a whole other to display such hatred and bigotry.  i appreciate this type of reviews, that way i can avoid places like this.</b_review>
<b_review>a group of men went over here to get some beer and wings last night, and a few customers gave them a bad look because obviously there were two gay couples. they ordered some food and drinks, but the bartender immediately started being rude to them when asking for their ids. they did nothing but want some food and drinks. one of them was asked to leave immediately, and the group asked why they needed to leave. the bartender just kept getting ruder and ruder. eventually the group got up to leave without eating, as the bartender told them they weren't wanted... he said that native new yorker is a "straight bar" and they weren't wanted there ever.</b_review>

<text>our team chose this place to have breakfast 2nd year in a row before our team build activity. i guess we spend so much time together we're starting to think alike because all 6 of us ordered the same thing, the chicken fried steak, gravy & eggs! six people can't be wrong, we all cleaned our plates! i thought it was better than my usual favorite go to restaurant for chicken fried steak breakfast. this place appears to be a little hole in the wall cafe but it was certainly busy, has great food and service to match,  one of those tucked away places that is a must try!</text>
<u_review>first time in fye, i was on the search for a specific cd that i knew i wouldn't find in a regular store. i went up to the counter and asked if they had it. i was expecting a repy like "who or how do you spell that" i didn't get that at all, julia was an amazing help! she said i believe we have one and lead me straight to it. at last the jimmy durante cd i'd been looking for! quick, easy, affordable, and fantastic customer service!  i'll definitely being going back to fye!</u_review>
<u_review>of course driving by the name caught my attention, so why not!? after checking in with some adventerous friends, i noticed the placed lacked in reviews and thought i'd be the first, but leave it to those experienced elite to lead the way! the place was small and lacked in an abundance of  love toys as the name implies, they did have plenty of cute outfits, and costumes ranging in sizes from small, super small to xtra small and some  super high heels that would challenge even the most experienced of dancers! prices seemed affordable for even the average "working girl" , but don't worry guys they had costumes and colorful undercarriage for men too! although they did advertise great deals on dvds it was the outdated vhs tapes and reading material that caught my attention, ! no purchases were made, i've seen and experienced better and after a crack of the whip we were off to find our next adventure...</u_review>
<u_review>i absolutely adore cracker barrel, the food the store, the atomosphere! i took my son for a mom & son time, no complaints from him it's one of his favorites as well! it takes alot of food to fill my son's stomach but he had the pancake breakfast and finished every crumb, said he couldn't eat another bite. brionna was our server, we never had to ask for anything, except for the yummy apple butter given upon request. my boy had never tried it, imagine that! he'll remember to ask for it now, loved it! i had the meatloaf sandwich, so good and cooked to perfection! of course made a pit stop in the shop and picked up the cutest coffee cup at a great bargain!  the perfect way to spend a day! great food and great company!</u_review>
<u_review>i went here today for our company's department "holiday brunch" and the best thing i can say was at least i wasn't the one paying. there were roughly 30 in our group which isn't an easy task to handle so the buffet style version of fajitas made sense to serve. there was a choice of either chicken or beef with rice and beans, taco size tortillas all the food was served barely warm with little flavor. you could indulge in sour cream & the salsa that probably came from a jar, also no flavor. i got the rice with no flavor and the chicken that came with a bonus 2 inch bone, luckily i survived to write this review. the decor is still slightly charming with photos of geronimo & james dean although the once famous sawdust was removed due to falls, their saloon girl still hangs from the ceiling but she too is desperate need of a makeover! the employee uniforms are dated, but the service was decent.  this once beloved & famous landmark type restaurant is unfortunately on it's way to becoming a ghost town!</u_review>
<b_review>at first glance and the area its in your like i am not going in there! but man what a surprise!! food was great and the staff was friendly. great place for lunch!</b_review>
<b_review>where the hell are we!!  like i said we didnt get to too many different places to eat this week. so everyday we would head over here for lunch and yes i mean everyday!now they where driving and buying so what could i say, but wow this place was out in the middle of nowhere. it was an old converted house and they offered a huge menu of all country cookin. the place was always packed at lunch time so it was well known in these parts. i found the food very tasty and the service was great and entertaining. wish it was here in these parts =)</b_review>
<b_review>i have now been to this restaurant 5 times. i have taken my staff, my wife, a client, a vendor and just stopped for breakfast one day.  always good, always friendly! it is also always very busy so go early; it is worth the hunt to find it.</b_review>
<b_review>peppersauce cafe is one of my favorite places to eat. though there are many amazing dishes here, my favorite is the pulled pork sandwich. it is topped with onion rings and is fantastic!. i discovered this restaurant about 3 years ago when i was working in the area. i have taken many customers and friends there for lunch. it's a real home cooked meal for just over the price of what you would get fast food. the staff is courteous and remembers who you are. i think that's important for businesses.  anyhow, peppersauce gets two thumbs up from me!</b_review>

<text>i've got to say, even after all the day drinking we did before stopping it, this place still was a disappointment.   i'll be honest, we only came here because geisha had an hour and fifteen minute wait. crazy.  there were four of us. sitting on the patio. in the dark. bring a flashlight, seriously it's dark. and something to stabilize the table... they wobble. good thing there's no cutting involved.  my buddy and i ordered edamame to start, and then  the crispy spicy tuna and the spicy shrimp and scallops. the scallops is $21!! we were a little hesitant at the price of just one item but to use his words "oh man, we're in for a real treat!".  out comes the food. the crispy spicy tuna is four pieces. womp womp. all it is... is crunch. no real flavor or spiciness. just super hard and crunchy.  then the real joke comes. our spicy shrimp and scallops is literally one overcooked jumbo shrimp, two smallish scallops and four rice cakes sitting in a bowl of broth. i'll give them this, the broth was delicious. super spicy and awesome. but the portion size is a joke considering the price. we were laughing hysterically at our gross overstatement of a "real treat".   oh and the edamame was never brought out. our server... jennifer? jessica? she was sweet and apologized and graciously removed it from the bill.   the bathrooms are super weird also. the sliding door is like wide open for the restaurant to see in to and i wasn't sure if i was supposed to shut it... strange. each stall is closed, but you can see the urinals in the men's room as you walk in to the women's. very awkward and not too clean.  i won't return.</text>
<u_review>i loved this trail when i first started hiking it. but now, no. maybe it's the time of year that brings out all of these god forsaken gnats, or maybe i'm just too sweet for my own good but i swear to god i can't stand all the gnats.   the trail itself starts out easy, slow and steady incline with a beautiful view of the mountain in front of you. about 2-3 miles in it gets steadily steeper. beyond the four mile mark you'll encounter slightly narrower and rockier terrain. you will lose cell service (verizon), which to me is a good thing! i'm hiking to get away from you people!   there is a healthy supply of wildlife: birds, chipmunks, rabbits, snakes, bugs. and of course during the spring, it's quite verdant and beautiful. i always notice an excellent breeze between the peaks as well.   again, though, the thing that is keeping my away from this trail for good is the horrible gnats. if you can jog the entire trail, they'll stay away, but move at a pace any less than a jog and they swarm you. i can't stand that. i literally look like i'm have a seizure swatting away the little bastards.   and so, in conclusion, i love the trail, it's beautiful and an excellent work out, but i can't take the bugs.</u_review>
<u_review>so i show up lookin all fly and feelin good. i awkwardly walk through the casino trying to find this elevator the front desk speaks of to the club. there's a line of people waiting to check ids and my hopes start to sink. i'm clearly the youngest person here. and i'm 27, which is not too young for a club.   while in line, which why am i even waiting in line looking this good? damn. anyway, while waiting in line against my will, they turn a few dudes away for wearing jeans. so you would think exclusive, right? not really.   i don't pay a dime to get in because i'm a chick, but the dudes pay $10, sucks!  ok so i get upstairs. make a sweep for my friends and check the place out. the bouncer in the elevator was saying how the crowd was the best he's seen in a while. he must have been talking about a different club because all i see are a whole mess of unfortunate old men and a handful of tacky looking young girls. and of course the younger, wall flower guys who stand along the edge of the dance floor creepily watching people grind while clutching their bud light until it almost shatters. ick.   this isn't too cheap of a place and bartenders are in their own little world. this guy in a wheelchair was in front of me waiting to order for a few minutes and the bartender blatantly ignored him. not cool.   i ordered one mixed drink and three shots. i asked him how much it would be and he said "i don't know! i'll ring you up when i'm done". seriously? all you do is make mixed drinks and shots and you can't figure out off the top of your head how much it will cost? ugh, well the answer was $40 fricken dollars.   we danced to about 6 songs, all rap/hip hop dance crap. he even played one song twice. so lame.   so totally not recommended.</u_review>
<u_review>aye chihuahua!  so i'm mucho hambre and it's christmas at 10pm on a sunday. bad combination for finding food out there.   but lo, i see a shining beacon. is it the north star leading me to the new born baby jesus?   no! it's eriberto's! praise the lord god almighty!  arriba, arriba!  i had the california burrito which is potato, cheese, pico de gallo and meat. i ate half of it and somehow it changed from burrito to brick somewhere between my mouth and my poor stomach.   would i return? um... no.</u_review>
<u_review>my buddy and i had brunch here before our day at the mim and wow, what a great experience!  we are totally "those" people, he's a vegetarian and i'm dairy free. i know, i know, annoying. tryst totally doesn't mind! their menu caters to all types of tastes and requirements. they proudly serve a creative and organic menu.  we each had a spicy bloody mary. fricken delicious, they're made with cucumber vodka and all sorts of veggies: olives, pickled green beans, celery, cherry tomato. the works. totally hit the spot.  i had the huevos rancheros. anytime i see this offered in a menu, i get it, so i'm kind of an expert. i wasn't overly impressed, but it was all right. there were way too many tortilla strips, which made the dish hard to manage. it was more like a "build your own" since all the ingredients were separated on the plate. good flavor though.  the service was great as well, you could tell the girl was knowledgable and fun. the manager (or owner?) also stopped by to check on us and was super friendly.  it's really nice to have a small mom and pop type eatery in the land of chain restaurants and shops.   highly recommended!</u_review>
<b_review>the sushi is nothing special and they're very proud of it.  that's why i only go here for happy hour.  saporo bomber and saki for something like $5.  the happy hour menu is enough to set you right, but i come for the drinks and the scenery.</b_review>
<b_review>this place served up one of the worst customer experiences i've ever seen a restaurant provide.  we went in and although the place had plenty of seating it took them almost 20 minutes to seat 8 people.  we told our waitress (who was really trying her hardest to keep up while her managers stood up at the bar and laughed) that we were in a hurry and put in our drink order.  after close to 15 minutes we finally got our drinks and ordered up 5 rolls.  nothing special.  we finally got the first one almost 40 minutes after that.  three of our party had to leave without eating.    the food was very average.  after that we asked for our check and again a long delay before we got our bill.  we asked to speak to the manager about this and he finally came over another 15 minutes later.  when we spoke to him about our experience he became extremely agitated and offered to pay for one of our rolls.  i told him thanks but no thanks and i would just pay the bill.  then i informed him that this situation was obviously not our waitresses fault because the management was as bad as you'll find in this part of scottsdale.    as we were leaving he told us that he never wanted us to come back again.    absolutely awful experience.</b_review>
<b_review>super cute!!!  sushi was fresh, service was great and atmosphere was stimulating!  perfect place to people watch and enjoy some good sushi!  hip, fun and yum!!!!</b_review>
<b_review>this really just about the happy hour deals. great happy hour until 7, which i think is later than it used to be or their scottsdale quarter location. half price drinks and $1 hot sake. same for appetizers, including some shrimp. great bargain and they have no problem with lingering and checking back right before hh ends.</b_review>

<text>what an excellent lunch i had here! rand h. organized a little uye for this place with mike c., robyn n., arlin b. and myself. the establishment is in a rather cramped commercial strip but the restaurant itself is quite roomy, although it doesn't look it at first when you enter. i ordered a ceviche appetizer; this was the best ceviche i've ever had -- i would come here just for this! for my entree, i had the bistecas y huevos with rice and beans; it came with sides of avocado and mexican cheese. i also had a refreshing glass of mango agua fresca which accompanied the meal perfectly. great food, great prices, and great service even when the place is busy - no wonder this place is so popular.</text>
<u_review>the tacos i had here - chicharron, carnitas, pollo, and carne asada - were really good and so inexpensive. they were very well-seasoned, with a little bit of spicy kick; if you want more heat, the tables have plastic bottles of red and green salsas. this is beyond hole-in-the-wall, though: la frontera consists of two trucks, each with a blue tarp and dining tables and chairs beside it. both are kind of permanently stationed in a lot on 16th street near van buren, with a watermill station in the middle of the lot. i got my tacos from the truck nearest the street; the other truck is for mariscos and sonoran  hotdogs.</u_review>
<u_review>i finally got to try their signature sandwich for lunch today: the rocket burger -- three beef patties, cheese, and fixings, in a sesame hoagie roll. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-zbfr1bhvarfp1d6xh8joq?select=j3gar5zswnk5fjckaht9rw  it was awesome! this place continues to delight me with each visit.</u_review>
<u_review>this is soooo worth the detour when i travel from phoenix to the east valley. a very simple menu, delicious burgers, fresh-cut fries, great service. i hope to learn one day what the secret menu is, but until then i'm happy with the things i get from the regular menu.</u_review>
<u_review>this is a great store for those who love exploring the great outdoors. there is a good variety of merchandise for camping, kayaking, running, hiking, and other activities. the goods are high quality and there are many that are hard to find in other stores - such as folding bikes, one of which i'm hoping to purchase in the near future.  this explains why a lot of the goods are a bit (but not overly) pricey. being a hiking enthusiast, i especially like their hiking gear such as trekking poles, and the high-quality detailed trail maps of the local and regional hiking areas.</u_review>
<b_review>this food is legit.  we ate the alambre de res, which is a flour quesadilla with chopped beef with bell peppers, onions and cheese and the torta nortena torta,  grilled steak, onion, jalapenos, melted cheese, chipotle, tomato, avocado and mayo-chipotle dressing.  both were fantastic.  the menu is extensive and there really is so much to try.  these 2 were fairly basic and clearly something a novice would order, but it was a good start and a great choices for a first timer.  i want to try the tacos and other tortas that have all sorts of amazing options like ham, chorizo, eggs, avocado and much more all in one torta.  some of them were so high, i thought for sure the tops were going to fall off and the people eating them were going to bust the button on their pants- no doubt.</b_review>
<b_review>my boss took a few of us here on 07-15-10 because he saw it on man vs. food. we ordered their famous del rey torta and this meal was huge and absolutely delicious! i was only able to consume half the sandwich, you can surely bring a friend to split the meal. i would definitely go back and order this again. they also give you a red and green salsa. the red one is great cuz its got some heat after you keep eating some. their ceviche is wonderful too!  i also had their flan, but i wasn't a big fan of it. i make my own and mine is creamy and sweet. theirs is...the opposite.  our order of water took awhile. the one in the group that ordered coke got their drink first, probably cuz they paid for their drink...joking. but i ended up requesting to get our waters then they brought it.  overall, it was a great experience and i definitely need to stop for the del rey torta again and bring some friends.</b_review>
<b_review>oh my goodness!!! love, love, love this place. i got the torta nortena de pollo and my fiance got the chicken tacos and we were in heaven. the food was perfect. absolutely perfect. and cheap too! this is our new favorite mexican place.   you. must. try... this. place.</b_review>
<b_review>i have been to this place a couple of times.  it is a hole in the wall in sunnyslope, not fancy at all, but the food is awesome!  this time we had the torta nortena de pollo and the regular size shrimp ceviche tostada (both items shared between two people).  i also had a  delicious pineapple agua fresca.  i was glad we did not each order a torta because it would have been too much food.  the torta was very good and the ceviche was heaping and tasty (we ordered it on two tostada shells instead of one).  great value for the price and service staff was very attentive.  try it out!</b_review>

<text>i'm continuing with my downtown streak of reviews... i finally made it to switch!  this review is for my experience at lunchtime... and let me warn you, it gets busy during the weekday lunch hours, so go early or go late, but arrive at noon, and more than likely you will have to wait.  however, the community table is an option if you go solo or with a small group.  another warning - the parking situation at noon - i think i lucked out and got the last spot in the lot; i happened to see a truck leaving when i came in, but there didn't seem to be any other open spots.  i noticed that durant's next door offered 'humble valet parking' (interesting signage), but not sure if you are dining at switch where you would park in this scenario.  i walked in through the back, and i liked the atmosphere and vibe immediately.  i was told there was a 20 minute wait for my party of 3, so i found myself a seat and did some work while i waited.  pretty sure they have wifi although i was using my verizon card.  great people watching was distracting me too; enough so that i missed when the rest of my party walked in!  anyways, i caught up with them and enjoyed a great lunch...  service was right on, and it was an overall delightful dining experience.  i had the 'super chop' salad - it had a little bit of everything in it (artichokes, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, sunflower seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach & field greens) - and i added turkey for a small extra charge... it was a huge serving and the perfect healthy lunch!  (note to self and to anyone else that may be interested in adding protein to your salad in the future - go with something other than the turkey... i hate to sound picky, but it wasn't amazing).  anyways, my two new friends (kate and angie) are regulars at switch, so they ordered the hummus and lamb apps and shared - good idea!  i tried the hummus and it was tasty - i like how they served it with pita and sides of artichokes and peppers.  it was a tad different than the hummus at fez, or at least that is what we all decided.  we were all very satisfied and too full for dessert... i guess i'll have to come back to try that another time.  dessert and a bunch of other menu items that sounded good.  i also noticed that switch serves breakfast all day on saturday and sundays, and does catering - good to know!</text>
<u_review>meh... the only reason i even stepped foot into rock bottom is because i had a lunch meeting and it was at the suggestion of my dining companion. i used to go to rock bottom in atlanta every now and then and it was ok... especially if you go for beer / happy hour.  i going to be blunt here right now though:  this place sucks!  luckily, i enjoyed the company of those that i dined with, otherwise, it would've been a miserable experience!  thanks for that, miranda and ken (if you happen to read this!)    i had their cobb salad and it was pretty average although the turkey in it was nasty.  our waitress was slow as hell.  the atmosphere (keep in mind we were there for lunch) was nothing special.  rock bottom is the reason that i'm not big on chains.  i don't think i'll be returning.  even if i'm stuck at desert ridge, there are plenty of other dining options that are far superior to rock bottom (cpk, yardhouse, rubios, and more).  sorry, rb - had to do it...</u_review>
<u_review>i've been to tea lite cafe a couple of times over the years, with my most recent visit today when i went for lunch with lindsey f.  tlc may not look like much from the outside, (it sits in a far corner of a strip mall and it's got a tiny little storefront and sign), but it's a fast-casual concept with moderate prices, friendly service, and pretty good vietnamese food too!  i'm a huge vietnamese fan, so it's always a difficult decision when it comes to ordering, but tlc's menu is short and sweet.  highlights include the spring rolls and pho.  if dining in, i recommend going with the tea lite special which allows you to sample one spring roll, two egg rolls and your choice of chicken or beef pho soup for just $8.99.  i love all of the sauces they serve from fish sauce, hoisin, siracha, and more; i enjoy mixing them all together!  tlc also offers boba, which i love but have yet to try it since i'm typically pretty full after demolishing my meal, but i will be back soon next time the boba craving hits!</u_review>
<u_review>bummer... i thought for sure i'd be the first to review this amazing gelateria after my visit there tonight.  unfortunately, it looks like elliot h. beat me to the punch.    elliot, i will forgive you though - your review was right on!  the bf and i both agree that this is the best gelato we've had in town!  the decor and presentation was extremely appealing... the employee behind the counter was friendly and patient with us; even allowed us each to tase several flavors before making our decisions!  i was pleased to see that there were several fat free/sugar free choices (aka doppio zero) and i ended up with ff/sf vanilla and cookie.  both were amazing and you would never know that they were the healthy choices!  the bf went with rasberry and lemon sorbetto and was very pleased as well.  i noticed that you can get 'gelato to go' in pint or quart sizes.  note to self - this is the perfect dessert to bring to someone's house when they have us for dinner!  total bill for our 2 medium sized gelato:  $8.11.    level of satisfaction: 5+ stars.  thank you, sweet life gelateria, for a sweet ending to our evening!  we will be back...</u_review>
<u_review>actors theatre phoenix is a really cool organization - they are supported by ticket sales of their productions and by local donors.  they've been around for over 21 years...  i've been to several of their productions and hope to attend many more!  a christmas carol is a big one that starts soon and runs through december 23rd.    the other shows they have are always unique, deeper, though-provoking, sometimes risque, but always professional.  we need to support actors theatre to keep these shows coming!  actors theatre performs exclusively at the herberger theater center in downtown phoenix.   hope to see you at a show sometime soon!</u_review>
<b_review>my wife suggested switch for brunch on a saturday morning.  we were quickly seated and beat the late rush, which always starts a meal right.  we were given good service, good drinks, and good food.  the restaurant is beautiful and comfortable inside, and has a nice outdoor area as well.  the ambiance is a little trendy, but it was not a deterrent.  their brunch specials are exceptional and we left quite happy.  i had the chef special, a slow cooked pork sandwich, very tasty.  my wife enjoyed the crepes juevos rancheros, which were delicious.  we also shared a carafe of screwdriver, which tasted like it had fresh squeezed oj, thumbs up.  i have been there once before and have never been disappointed in the food or service.    thank you switch, we will be back.</b_review>
<b_review>i went to @switchwinebar for the @dine4az #dine4aztweetup. i previously went as part of the light rail pub crawl, and was not very impressed.  i am now a fan. $3 italian drunken sodas, $3 caipirinhas, and a great spread of food.  they had a turkey sandwich, with fresh, handmade strawberry jam, that was so delicious, and reminded me of a monte cristo, but not fried. i could eat one of these every day!  the location is very convenient for light rail, and is close enough to downtown.  the beer selection was "ok, the drunken italian soda was really nice, and sneaks up on you, but the caipirinhas were simply fantastic.  i'm thinking i may have to try their brunch, before i make a solid determination about our future together.  but i really enjoyed the tweetup, and my impression of switch moved up quite a bit.</b_review>
<b_review>after having countless yummy lunches at switch i decided to host my dad's surprise 60th birthday brunch here a few months ago and i am so glad that i did!  a huge thanks to jason and his staff for helping to make our party such a success.  the ambiance, food and service were absolutely wonderful - each of our 50 guests loved switch (so much so that one of my dad's colleagues already booked the space for a private event, having never been there prior to our party)!  the coordination for our event was so easy and seamless leading up to the day itself, too.  jason helped me put together a menu that allowed our guests to pick from among 5 options (one of which is not on the regular menu but was easily added because it's my dad's fave breakfast food) and all you can drink bloody marys, mimosas, coffees, juices and soft drinks.     our menu consisted of: croissant sandwich with egg, bacon, smoked gouda and aioli egg burrito with jack cheese and potatoes mornay covered crustless quiche with smoked turkey, green onions, spinach, and mushrooms. candied pecan pancake stack sourdough french toast stickies with bacon or sausage  the portions were huge and all of the dishes received rave reviews!!  jason also printed personalized menus for all of our guests which were featured at each place setting.  the staff were attentive and accommodating and the space is so beautiful that we really didn't need decorations.  if you are looking for the perfect venue for a private party, i recommend switch 100%!</b_review>
<b_review>the waiter got the drink wrong: "up" means served strained without ice, not on the rocks, but i was happy about the mistake, the salmon melted in my mouth and the bread pudding made me fat for hours, but was so worth it.  great atmosphere and none of our plates were empty when taken away.  i would definitely go back.  good service, great food, fun atmosphere.  great flexible hours on a sunday.  go !</b_review>

<text>the view alone deserves an excellent review. this restaurant is located inside the hyatt regency hotel... a circular shaped building that spins (yes, spins) to give you a rotating view of the entire city. it's absolutely beautiful and the ambiance is incredibly romantic.   i ordered the double cut lamb rack and he ordered the angus ribeye. the meat was cooked exactly the way we requested... we both prefer medium and the chef figured out the perfect balance of not to bring it out bloody - but not overcooked either. we finished off with the creme brulee cheesecake, some fancy chocolate cake and a red wine our server recommended. i definitely loved the dessert more... so much so that he had to remind me how many hours we would be in the gym tomorrow. talk about a sugar buzz kill...  the wait staff are friendly and consistently check on you. we didn't have to wait for water refills or the bill to come out. i was definitely impressed.  it is, however, a pricey restaurant (prepare to spend about $150 for two people) but i think it was well worth it.</text>
<u_review>based on the other reviews, it seems my girlfriends and i have been lucky whenever we stop in for dinner/happy hour. our waitresses (especially today - i wish i got her name) are very sweet and accommodating. i don't eat pork, and they always substitute and replace menu items to make sure i can order what i want. this location's set-up is better than the one on 61st (larger and with music) so we always come here.   to be honest, i'm a yen junkie (their happy hour sucked me in)...  but whenever me and the girls want to switch it up, we always drop by ah-so and enjoy ourselves.</u_review>
<u_review>i really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately i won't be returning.  the customer service is stellar. i can't stress this enough. they went above and beyond to accommodate and did so with a smile. fat tip for them!  the outside patio is great, especially during this time of the year. it's spacious and a delight for people who like to look at something other than a wall, as you can see all of westgate from their patio.  food and drinks... this is where they lost me. pizza has absolutely no flavor. mozzarella sticks had no cheese on the inside. wings were decent but nothing special. they don't serve margaritas because there's no blender... i thought that was interesting.   the bill came out to $75 for one pizza, wings and a sampler. it just wasn't worth it.</u_review>
<u_review>my best friend and i found this place via yelp after a horrendous experience at mimi's cafe... so happy we did! food is great and everyone is so friendly. you can eat out on the patio with shaded tables, or you can eat inside while they play great music (we were dancing to james brown while ordering our food). it'll be our new breakfast spot from now on!</u_review>
<u_review>groupon is running a package deal - $25 for three car washes. i was hesitant to purchase based on the reviews, but my curiosity got the best of me.  upon completion: - my car came back in one piece - no one stole anything - the car came back clean - got a free oil change - smells like fresh pine breeze (mmmm!) - service guys didn't have an attitude or try to upsell  so, i don't know if i just got lucky... or if everyone is a bit dramatic when it comes to their car washes. 4 stars and a repeat customer.</u_review>
<b_review>if you go, try their reverse happy hour!  it is a bargain that they charge only $5 for well drink and dessert at the rotating restaurant on the 24th floor. although the phoenix skyline isn't all that exciting, the restaurant still offers a nice view of the city.  if you are a tea drinker, the compass offers numi tea (my favourite) as well as tazo. the peach upside down cake was generously portioned, but every component (cake/ice cream/tres leches sauce) on the plate was too sweet skyrocketing my blood sugar. i would have liked more peach slices on the cake...  our server made a mistake of overcharging me (looking at the receipt, i noticed just right now...), but he was friendly and courteous. next time, i'll double-check the bill before i sign and i should order a bread pudding or cheesecake!</b_review>
<b_review>let's get the boring bad  stuff out of the way so i can talk about the fun part.  over-priced not delicious you have two people waiting on you, but it's always slow bad water- seriously, not even a lemon can mask the disgusting flavor of their water it's always cold  honestly, if this restaurant wasn't high up and spinning, i would never go here.  i took my nieces ice skating at city scape so i figured this would be a fun place to have an over priced dinner since we were right up the street. when in rome....or something.  i ordered some curry chicken thing and my nieces had grilled cheese off the kids menu.  we also ordered a molten cake for dessert but there was no molten? whatever, no need to to hash it because i knew going in the food sorta sucks.   our bill was $70 but we seriously had a blast. the whole dinner was filled with gasps and excitement and sheer thrill about how fun this restaurant was.</b_review>
<b_review>let me first start off by saying that this is an upscale restaurant, located in the heart of downtown phoenix, inside a major hotel and . . .  are you ready for it??? . . .  it spins so that as you dine you get to enjoy a 360*, panoramic, constant changing view of phoenix.  that alone should scream pricey!!   for anyone who has ever dined at a formal, upscale dining establishment such as this, you know that the price is high while the portions are small.  however, the food is worth it.  this is true of the compass arizona grill.   my husband had the filet, while i enjoyed the seared scallops.  the filet was done med. rare, flavorful and melted in your mouth.  the scallops were tender and succulent with just the right amount of butter.  at the end of our meal we decided to share a dessert (the chocolate pot . . .) which was just the right amount of sweetness and rich decadence we were looking for.   over all the ambiance and the food made this one of the nicest dining experiences.  if you can afford it and understand that pricey doesn't always mean a large portion but does mean excellent food, then i highly recommend the compass arizona grill.</b_review>
<b_review>the view alone bumps this to a 4 star.  i have lived in the valley for over 10 years and i finally visited the compass restaurant. a spectacular view of the city at sunset couldn't have been more perfect.  the food was really good, although i can't rave about it, because we have so many other great restaurants that i believe are much better for the price. however, i realize the view is really what you're paying for. there was a special eggplant bisque that was definitely worth mentioning though!!  a great place to take special guests or a lucky date who might enjoy watching the sunset over the mountains and an endless sea of city lights.</b_review>

<text>a friend and i were meeting up for lunch and the original plan was to go to a different thai place we'd been to before.  unfortunately that place didn't open until 5:00 and we met up at 3:00...fail.  luckily i used my handy-dandy yelp app to find other thai places within a nearby radius and thai e-san was the closest one and had a decent rating.  it's definitely a pretty nondescript building but i figured that a lot of the time those are the hidden gems that most people don't give a chance to.  we walked in and someone was already waiting with menus (i'm assuming he saw us pull up through the windows) and took us to a table right away.  there was only one other group in the restaurant but it was a little late for normal lunch and early for dinner so i wasn't surprised.  it worked out nicely for us though as our waitress was able to check on us frequently and made sure our drinks were always full and we had everything we needed.  the menu is huuuuge!!  there are at least 70+ items to choose from so it's a little overwhelming at first and if you're indecisive like me it's quite the task picking just one thing!  i ended up going with the spicy fried rice with basil with beef as the meat.  i also ordered the thai egg rolls.  my friend got something with silver noodles, i can't remember what it was listed as on the menu.  the egg rolls came out nice and hot and crispy, flavor was good and i love that they have the sweet and sour sauce in bottles on the table so you can apply it as you like.  the main dishes came out not to long after and portions were very generous.  i ate more than i probably should have because it was so good and it looked like i'd barely touched my plate.  even my friend who is 6'8" couldn't finish his plate.  we both concluded that we were happy the other thai place was closed as this one had a bigger selection and bigger portions so it seems like it was meant to be!</text>
<u_review>dropped in with a friend on a friday night and it was d-e-a-d.....that's never a good sign but we figured oh well, we're here so might as well stay.  we grab a table and a waitress comes over pretty quickly to get our order.  my friend was hungry so we asked about food but she informed us that the kitchen closed at midnight, it was about 12:08.  that was annoying because i just feel like if your establishment is open until 2:00 you should have the whole thing open until 2:00am.  so once that was discovered we decided we were just gonna finish our drinks and look for somewhere that did serve food.  unfortunately at this point our waitress had vanished.  we were looking around the whole bar (which again, was 90% empty) and couldn't find her anywhere.  after a while i finally spot her and made some serious eye contact until she figured out that we needed her.  the whole stop there felt like a waste of time and was accompanied by service that, while friendly, wasn't present when we needed it.</u_review>
<u_review>this is a great dog park to have in the area.  it has a ton of room for the big dogs to run around and there are baggies and trash cans scattered all around it so you don't have to go far to pick up after your dog.  i also love that there are a couple water stations in case you don't bring your own water bowl.  the area for the small dogs looked to be a pretty decent size as well.  the only downside to this dog park is that the ground is pretty muddy so i'd recommend wearing shoes you don't care about and bringing extra towels to clean up your pup after they're done.</u_review>
<u_review>it was the night of my best friend's birthday and her boyfriend had rented out the top room of goldie's to get everyone together to celebrate.  when i got upstairs i was really impressed with the room!  it was huge!!  lots of tables and chairs, there were pool tables, shuffleboard, arcade games, not to mention bathrooms and a bar just for the room as well.  once my initial awe of the place wore off i realized that i was hungry so i started perusing the menu.  i decided that the pepper jack focaccia looked yummy so once the waitress came around i put in my order.  due to how delicious the description made it sound my level of hunger escalated quickly.  unfortunately the speed of delivery of said meal was not what i had hoped for.  i realize that our waitress had a large group of people to serve but i also showed up a couple hours after everyone else so there may have been one or two other orders in, if that.  it's not like everyone was ordering something at the same time.  once my food did arrive i was happy with it.  the focaccia dough was soft and not so thick that i felt like i was just eating bread.  the ingredients inside were good and had a decent flavor but there wasn't really anything that gave it that extra pow to excite me and make me crave it the next day.  even the side of sweet jalapeno dressing that came with it was pretty average.  i know it starts with the word "sweet" but jalapeno is the second word and there was no heat!  i want to come back another time and just get a regular table, order something else, and get a true experience of the place but for now i just had an average experience here.</u_review>
<u_review>i finally got fed up enough with dealing with the tweakers and other various psychos that frequent walmart so i decided to drive a little farther than normal and check out fresh & easy.  it's very bright and clean and everything is laid out nicely.  very easy to find everything and i like that they don't have lots of options for different brands of items (why are there 27 thousand different companies who make ketchup anyway???)  they focus on quality rather than quantity and i for one appreciate that.  not to mention that their prices are awesome too!  who would have thought quality and affordable could work together?  i will definitely plan a little extra travel time in order to shop here from now on.</u_review>
<b_review>this is one of my favorite spots for thai! the service and staff are always stellar. i love the spicy fish and coconut soup. the papya salad is something everyone needs to try at least once.</b_review>
<b_review>i came for the thai issan food which is heavily influenced by issan culture and not as much by the siamese which is the typical style of ubiqitous thai restaurants . the history is a different story. it's about the issan food; generally not supposed to be spicy, oily or colored but looked homemade, can eat with your hand without feeling primitive and satisfying.  my party ordered 5 plates to share. they arrived in about 15 minutes. the pad thai was right on in terms of flavor, soft texture and not colored. one saucy dish had some flavoring issue which could be fix by the cook tasting it before it leaves the kitchen. the other dishes were fine. the portions were right on and ingredients looked and taste natural. this is not processed fast food but 1 to 2.0 step above it as it takes a skilled and versatile cook to prepare and make. the dish prices are a few bucks more than typical thai food but the taste here is commensurate with the price.   when we arrive, we saw 2 women waitering there. i didn't experience the 7 minute followup rule and we had to call to get refills. the service could use some improving but i think it will take some time and effort from the asian staff to get up to speed in american style of service. i thought it was noteworthy that they ask how i wanted to vary the spicyness of my particular dish.   the store is smartly located near downtown and easy to access. the bland outside of the store does not match the inside. you will find granite table and a nice interior decor that is not too touristy. the inside decor raises the expectation that the food would be good and this place succeeds in that aspect.  i would recommend this as a place to bring others with me for isan food. the place just need to institute more american style customer service efficiency and attentiveness, then it matches the quality of the food and make this place a great place to stop by when you're in phoenix.</b_review>
<b_review>so i've tried a lot of thai restaurants in phoenix, ever since i moved here a couple of years ago and this is by far one of the best i have tried in the area. regardless of service, i come for the food which has never let me down. the cost is reasonable, the food is always on par and i have yet to have any real issue with the service. you can't go wrong if you choose to try one of the curry or rice dishes.</b_review>
<b_review>i'd love to write about each of what seems to be an onslaught of thai restaurants opening in the valley, but many offer the same style of fare. however, a few serve more unique dishes in addition to the classics.  located on indian school road next to 3 snaps resale shop, thai e-san specializes in the regional cooking of northeastern thailand, also known as the issan or esan region. it is difficult to clearly define esan cooking since many of those native dishes, like papaya salad and larb, are common on many thai menus. they are more about heat and sourness, as pretty much everything we tried here reflected that.  i have noticed some commonalities among thai restaurants, including gracious service. from the time we entered the large dining room until we left, the staff was polite and attentive, not to mention gorgeous. thai women are stunning.  another similarity with many thai restaurants is the sheer size of the menu. i have no idea how they can keep so many ingredients on hand to make so many dishes. if you don't mind some reading and ask lots of questions, you can learn a lot about food, cooking and, of course, eating.  starting with the thai e-san special appetizer ($12.95) lands you in the middle of a massive amount of shareable treats. brimming with crunchy egg rolls, tender peanut sauce laden chicken satay, wontons and a sweet and spicy cucumber salad, there is enough for at least three bear-sized appetites. the portions are large, so sharing is a must, which is also very esan.  the beef salad ($8.95) is sliced char-grilled sirloin with chili, onion, lime juice, rice powder and fresh thai herbs. it can be ordered with varied heat, from one, which is mild, to five, which is hot as it gets. i prefer ordering two or three, then add heat from the chile condiment jars. this dish was bold, with a nice sourness from the lime juice.  i also was excited about the thai e-san sausage ($10.95). it's more of a grilled savory sausage than a fermented sour or sweet sausage, with tubes stuffed with ground pork, pork skin and thai herbs with a heavy lime flavor. the snappy crunch of each bite led to textures of the pork skin and ground meat, tender with a chewy spring.  i love drunken noodles, and thai e-san's version was top notch. also called spicy noodle with basil ($8.95), there's a choice of meat or tofu that is stir fried with large wide noodles, chile, basil, bean sprouts, onions and bell peppers. each tender noodle tastes like it was seasoned on its own with an explosion of flavor and spice.  the massive pile of pineapple fried rice ($12.95) is mixed with shrimp, chicken and juicy pieces of fresh pineapple and topped with cashew nuts. it's a sensual mix of sweet, sour and salty, appealing to most, if not all, of your senses.  thai e-san offers only a couple of desserts, coconut ice cream ($3.50) and sticky rice with mango ($4.95). the latter offered slices of sweet ripe mango atop hot and sticky rice bathed with warm coconut milk for a great finish.  thai e-san has almost 100 menu items, so there is plenty to keep me coming back.</b_review>

<text>never one to let the idea of three square meals a day deter me from enjoying a visit to a new city my three plus days in phoenix, scottsdale, glendale, and chandler would additionally lead me to a number of ancillary eats - some upscale and french, some down n' dirty southwest, some new, some old, some hot, and some cold.  beginning first with my love of pastries, the first of these six stops would be at the combined grocery, café, bakery, liquor store, souvenir stand, and pizza parlor that is la grande orange grocery; the sort of place you have to see to believe yet the sort of place where it all seems to "fit."  harbored in a small strip mall with plenty of parking plus curbside checkout for those on the go i made my way into la grande orange only half knowing what to expect and having already mentioned the commodities entailed the only thing i could think of when i entered the door was a trip to whole foods if you condensed the entirety of one store into a space approximately one quarter the size.  with cups to one side and cupcakes to the other, wine to my right and coffee to my left my first impression was one of total sensory overload yet at the same once i entered and started to browse i detected a sort of controlled chaos as the various lines moved toward their destination with a good flow.    having already eaten breakfast and had plenty of coffee with pizza plans at bianco for later in the day i took my time investigating the space - children's toys, shirts, travel mugs, cheeses, pre-made salads, locally roasted coffees - before finally approaching the pastry counter to browse the cornucopia of goods.  with many items baked in house and others provided by tammie coe bakery two doors down i weighed the options carefully while additionally gauging my hunger and although any number of the options sounded delectable i ended up settling for two; one my own choice and a sort of obligation at this point and the other a recommendation from the young woman at the counter as "the best thing in the world;" a promise i told her i'd hold her to if she was wrong, and after paying the modest tab i made my way to the street with my choices packed up (ostensibly for later, but in reality for enjoyment less than thirty minutes later as i checked into my hotel.)  beginning first with my selection, la grande orange's very own red velvet cupcake, this large specimen wrapped in red wax paper and topped with an ample pile of cream cheese frosting would prove to be one of the better red velvets i've had in some time save for the stellar version at bouchon bakery just one month prior.  loaded with notes of cocoa and sugar plus the faint taste of cinnamon and what i'm pretty sure was clove i really enjoyed the subtle nuance to this cake and despite the $3.95 price tag the portion was substantially larger and the cake significantly more moist than more expensive versions in other major cities.  moving next to the suggestion of my cashier, the tammie coe crumb bun, i really was not sure what to expect of the $2.50 option but what i received, while not the best thing in the world, was without a doubt the best sweet i had on my visit to arizona.  beginning first with the exterior, this golden biscuit looked something like a cinnamon roll meets a scone with a spiral texture encased in crystal sugar, but digging deeper and peeling off a layer the texture was instead somewhat akin to the famous breton kouign amann kissed with cinnamon and topped with streusel.  layer after buttery layer, bite after yeasty bite, and making a mess of the carpet (crumb bun indeed) all the while all i can say is that if you find yourself in the phoenix area this is a must try and given the quality of both selections i was lucky to be staying so far from la grande orange and tammie coe because otherwise i'd have gone back for more.</text>
<u_review>leaving matt's low on caffeine and realizing jiffy-lube and chase were not yet open to accomplish my afternoon errands i decided to next pay a visit to jobot coffee - a place i'd heard both good (music, coffee) and less-than-stellar (patrons, service) things about and pointing my gps to the address i at first wondered if i'd mistyped; to say the least the area is residential and unassuming, but upon seeing the "coffee" sign i assumed i was in the right place, parked, and walked in as sigur ros takk played on the outdoor speakers.  half knowing what to expect from a house-come-coffee shop named the "best place to take a scenester" by the local media i entered the doors of jobot to the aromatics of coffee and a bar populated by the partially hung-over and half-shaven but surprisingly also to smiling faces and families sitting with their ipads as the kitchen turned out respectable looking sweet and savory crepes.  not realizing that the space served food in addition to coffee i was greeted by a young lady at the bar who asked if i wanted a menu or if i knew what i'd like i deferred for a moment while i perused the options - eventually settling on an iced toddy and a pair of pastries made in-house that morning - a $10 tab including a $1 tip.  with the space almost intentionally run-down looking and tables, benches, and chairs strewn throughout three rooms i found bench and 2 tables near the back where a defunct piano sat alongside a family of four and after getting out my books took my first sip of the toddy - a rich blend from cartel with a bit of stone-fruit up front and deep chocolate notes on the finish before moving on to my pastries - a $2.50 strawberry "dohnut" and a $4.00 slice of dr. pepper cake.  beginning first with the donut - a small ring that was possibly baked rather than fried given the total lack of grease, rich cake-like texture, and pockets of berries plus an ample coat of not-too-sweet strawberry glaze i have to say the it was more 'muffin' than donut, but all in all it was still quite good.  moving next to the cake - dense, fudgy, and just bitter enough between the cocoa and the nuts to balance the saccharine sweetness of the soda it has been a long long time since i ordered something as simple as "chocolate cake" and while there is no doubt i could have made something like this at home it was a really nice reminder of how good 'comfort food' can sometimes be - particularly with really good coffee in a relaxed setting.</u_review>
<u_review>...it isn't used kids or vintage vinyl, but considering the size of the space they sure do cram a lot of quality into this place.  good prices and (relatively) friendly employees - not a 'destination' record store, but worth stopping by if you're in the area.</u_review>
<u_review>really nice zoo with a layout that proves quite conducive to getting close to the animals but i must say the nickel and diming is a bit off-putting; $3 to look at stingrays, $5 to pet a giraffe, $6 for a wheelchair, etc - it is a wonder they don't charge you to park.  good collection and a nice layout, but not necessarily a 'top tier' zoo despite the $20 admission price.</u_review>
<u_review>full review blogged. high points below:  chicken liver pate with poached cherries and tuscan toast: to anyone who knows me this was an obvious choice and served in a flip top jar for $7 along with a pile of lightly oiled toast it was every bit as good as i would have hoped.  dense and slightly rougher cut than a true mousse but rife with a mineral tinge below the liver's characteristic sapor the cherries served as a brilliant foil to the fat and easily enough for two this would have been the deal of the menu if not for the daily special.  focaccia di recco - ligurian style baked focaccia with fresh soft cow cheese and local honeycomb:  perhaps the most consistently raved dish from both the chicago location and from local gourmands who'd already visited davanti scottsdale the first time i'd heard of this dish was actually from our server at avec and although slightly different in texture and composition this ligurian classic marrying crisp focaccia with a stracchino/mascarpone blend was every bit as memorable.  taking an alternate route to avec's density and utilizing local honeycomb (an extra $2) as opposed to savory notes to balance the soft cheese's higher lactic acid content i'd be hard pressed to say who does it better, but at $18 i can only say this dish is worth the money even if it seems 'simple.'  roasted corn + walnuts + pecorino + arugula + wild mushrooms:  wanting to sample from each part of the menu this choice from the insalate was recommended by our server and although i would have preferred to taste it warm (simply too many items on the table at once) it was quite good at room temperature as well.  essentially the results of high quality ingredients paired carefully this was a dish about texture and flavor above anything else and with the mushrooms and corn each lightly cooked there was a great interplay of natural sweetness and earth all set off by the lightly applied cheese.  truffle egg toast + fontina + asparagus:  i'll start out by saying it wasn't as good as the incredible famous version at 'ino...but it was pretty damned close.  oddly a fan of eggs at all other meals despite my propensity for sweets at breakfast this "toad in a hole" style presentation featured nothing more than a dense piece of brioche topped with a thick slice of young fontina lightly kissed with truffle oil and black pepper plus julienned asparagus on the plate beneath; it was simple, it was rich, and it was the one dish i really wished would have arrived separated from the others so i could truly enjoy it as opposed gulping down my half for fear of it getting cold or soggy.  chef's whim - confit roasted half duck + sour cherry + mascarpone polenta + candied pecans + radish + endive:  i'd wanted to try a pizza, but when our server told us the saturday "chef's whim" i fortunately changed my mind - and i say thankfully not only because duck is my favorite protein, but because this was one of the best duck preparations i have ever tasted.  priced at a bargain $20 and featuring a half-duck split down the center served over a bed of mascarpone polenta and amarena cherries whose texture would rival the finest gelato this was the sort of rustic preparation i'd hoped for walking in the door.  intense and meaty with crispy skin giving way to tender flesh each bite of this dish was savored as much as the last and with sweetness from the cherries and pecans met by the bitters of the radish and endive the dish never felt 'heavy' at all.  honest to god, ff this is on the menu it is a must order - i've paid twice as much for far less impressive fowl at any number of 'top tier' restaurants.  chocolate budino -chocolate pudding + amaretto cookie + toasted marshmallow:  un-wowed by the standard dessert menu and myself with dinner plans three hours later we'd originally considered skipping dessert until our server told us the "chef's whim" dessert of the day was a budino - on par with bread pudding for 'must order' status for myself - and with a dense pudding of semi-sweet chocolate at its base subsequently topped with a warm amaretto cookie plus light meringue quickly toasted under the salamander this dish also wowed.  thankfully small in portion but huge in flavor i'd place this dish among the must orders.  the verdict:  service and music issues aside, davanti enoteca is a great addition to the local dining scene and although much of the menu is cribbed directly from west taylor st. the dishes where deruvo was allowed to flex his muscles were without a doubt the strongest of the afternoon.  perhaps the gnocchi did not live up to expectations and would have been better sold as a gnochetti and maybe some would argue that the focaccia is a bit overpriced priced at $18 but all things being equal my friend and i walked out the door for $60/pp after tax and a more than generous tip for a meal featuring 7 good-to-great dishes, particularly a duck dish i'd put on the same level with versions at gagnaire, eleven madison park, and l'arpege.</u_review>
<b_review>finally, i had gotten a chance to have dinner here.  the valet parking has always detoured me from going to lgo.  i have the cheese pizza and tried the kale salad.  the cheese pizza had a lot of flavor, there wasn't a ton of sauce but it was really tasty and the crust was crispy.  it took awhile to get our food but the service was good and having good conversation with friends made it worth the wait.    i will have to come back for breakfast.  i do love your muffins!</b_review>
<b_review>wanna know how to tell when your lunch salad is really good?  when you "drool a little bit" in between bites, like i did today with my chopped turkey salad from la grande orange.  i went there on sunday 10-24, and to be honest, the setup is a little confusing for newcomers.  order on this side, pickup food on that side, come back to this side to get dessert.  it's enough to make you want to just get in the car and drive home.  but don't !!!  if it weren't for the "drool event" which occurred today, i probably would not have posted this review at all.  i shared the green chile burger with my daughter, and we were both underwhelmed, really.  nothing awesome about the burger.  oh, it's far better than fast food burgers, but it's not comparable to lobby's or chuckbox (my two top burgers in town, probably.)  the french fries were a little thin and not too memorable really.  my son had the wings and loved them  but a hitch - i specifically requested ranch for the wings, and they came out with blue cheese, which i then had to take back and get exchanged for ranch.  not a huge problem, but just a little annoying.  the ranch was very good however.  the "olive oil cake" that everyone raves about?  meh.  it's just an extra-moist version of your average pound cake.  tastes just like the pound cake i grew up eating in texas, but it was a little "oilier" than your usual pound cake fare.  it was good, but not "oh my god!" good.  now for the best item i had from there:  the drool creator.  it was mostly an afterthought, really.  while standing in line to get the olive oil cake to go, i saw the little section where they keep their "to go" salads.  i looked around at the varieties, and thought the chopped turkey salad looked promising - bacon, boiled egg, turkey slices, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and two different dressings - blue cheese and some sort of yellowish vinaigrette.   i decided to take one home and eat it for lunch at work on monday and tuesday.  great.  decision.  i don't really know what the magic was.  maybe it was just a good combination of flavors.  maybe it was just all fresh.  maybe they use some sort of magical salad crack.  i don't know.  but it was a dang good salad.  even on the third day, when i ate the last of it.  i just combined both dressings ( about half of each little container each day ) and it was marvelous.  not too many meals cause me to drool in between bites.  this salad had some serious mojo.  i will be back for another one, hoping to recapture the magic.</b_review>
<b_review>no trip to phoenix is complete without at least one visit to lgo.  the spanish latte is now the havana latte, but i'm protesting and still ordering the spanish...just to show them that i've been around since the beginning.  i'm an ol' time lgo'er.    the menu has been expanded a little and i'm ok with that.  service seems to have picked up a little in the speed department, which is good.    i'll probably be back one more time before i head to the airport back to chicago.</b_review>
<b_review>i liked the hustle and bustle going down in here, coming from other metro areas there just isn't enough of that feel for me in phoenix.  my espresso drink was good.  i sniffed the cheeses.  i have nothing else informative to add on la grande orange.  bonne journée @lgogrocery</b_review>

<text>it has been 2 years since my initial review and i still faithfully visit here. my current favorites are the jalapeno burger (they fry the jalapenos and they are amazing), the 5 meat pizza, and the oreo pazookie. they also added some new pazookies to the menu and the white chocolate raspberry is amazing. the service is always fantastic, love the atmosphere, and they always have a new list of seasonal brews.  they just started a loyalty card and i am saving up for the free $25 gift card. it is easy to use and i can check my balance on line. i am halfway there!</text>
<u_review>i had some watches that five years ago i got batteries from here and i had warranty cards to replace the batteries if they died within five years. so of course a week before they expired two of them were dead. i actually found the warranty cards (i can't beleive i still knew where i kept them i sound like a very organized person). i went on down and within 15 minutes they had them both replaced. they quoted 20 minutes and came in under. it was no hassle, quick, and they were very friendly. so why 4 stars and not 5? well the batteries were close to $50 bucks, but 2 of the 3 did get replaced for free, so that is like $25 each. however, i can go downstairs in sears and get them done for $14.95 so even without the warranty (they only do a 1 year replacement) this is still a better deal.</u_review>
<u_review>i went for happy hour the other night. i really like the atmosphere here and the service was good. the happy hour prices are fantastic. however, the food was all luke warm. we had the potato skins, nachos, and a cup of tortilla soup. while it was all tasty, none of it was hot. the table was also very sticky. the server wiped it down but it was still sticky and had stuff dried to it. if they give the place a good scrubbing and get the food out as soon as it is hot, it would be 5 stars.</u_review>
<u_review>my sandwich was fresh and made right when i ordered it. the bread was really good, i mean i realize it was just sub bread but it was super fresh and yummy! a pleasant surprise!  people at work bring in the donuts all the time and they are always fantastic. the gentleman at the counter was friendly and helpful. i will be back!</u_review>
<u_review>how did i not know about this great little theater! first, there is not a bad seat in the house. the seats surround the performance floor. small snack bar with non alcoholic beverages and snacks. the producer comes out before the show to tell you about upcoming shows etc. i saw a production of sunset boulevard here on friday night and it was fantastic. very professional and what a great little venue to see it in! i was very impressed with the perfomers. great voices, acting, and passion! they have upcoming showings of legally blond and rocky horror picture show. i will be back to see more shows soon. for the price i don't think you could find a better friday night activity!</u_review>
<b_review>overall this was a pleasant dining experience.  the staff was friendly and frequently checked on us to make sure we were taken care of.  the establishment is clean and had a very casual, relaxed feel.  our party of four were able to share a single large pizza, which tasted very good.  although the meal was somewhat heavy, that's what you get when you order gormet pizza.  okay, onto dessert: we ordered a pizookie.  it's a cookie baked in a large dish with ice cream on top and it was delicious!  eating here wasn't the healthiest choice but it sure was satisfying.  would i eat here again?  yes!  will i go to the gym afterward?  yes!</b_review>
<b_review>we've been going to bj's for years. since the first on opened in az. this one just happens to be a little closer to where we live now so we go to this one more often than not.  there is some good and some bad here. good: the food is usually pretty solid. havent really had anything here that i was unhappy with. the menu is huge so if you come with a med-large party, theres going to be something for everyone. they have a good selection of beer and a full bar. they have a great raspberry cider that my wife loves! the bar area is great for happy hour and a game.  bad: they call this a brewery...and it isnt. its a restaurant that serves beer that the other bj's makes. this might not matter to you but it does to me. weak! because they're not an actual brewery, their liquor license is different and they cant fill the bj's growler that i bought. oh well, i'll use it to hold my change and i'll get my other growlers filled at real breweries. we've also experienced "dirty lines" here before. they should have their beer lines cleaned more often or more thoroughly or both.   best part of the menu: do not leave without having the pizookie for dessert. it is one of the best things you can put in your mouth!</b_review>
<b_review>it's always a happy surprise when coming here , either in the way of a seasonal beer or a employee who hates their job. either way the food is always what i expect and tastes the way i remember. if i want a sure bet i come here. love the soups and pizza lunch specials and the to go service to your car.</b_review>
<b_review>well, wow this place is getting slammed!!! maybe rightfully so, but i have never had a problem with their desserts, my girlfriend and i will sometimes go there just for dessert and that is it. we ate there once and they did take a few more minutes than i thought they should have, but wouldn't stop me from going back again.</b_review>

<text>the only reason i went is because my dad wanted a taco.  the last few times i have eaten here it has been nothing but a greasy mess.    i miss the days when julio g's was down the street.  the quality control and level of care to the food has gone way down hill in the last few years, and it is really sad to see.    with it being right next to the w, you'd think they would strive to be the best place ever.  if i was staying there, i'd walk to downtown and find something else.</text>
<u_review>good location, lots of parking and lots of space.  even a little play area for the kiddos.    i much prefer eating in because there is nothing better than a cheese pizza fresh out of the oven.  wow.  having to wait to eat it at home any pizza will lose that oven fresh perfection.  the wings are great and the pizza is pretty darn good, too.  they go a little heavy on the pizza sauce for my taste, but i will just remember to ask for light sauce next time.  the place is always busy on the weekends.  and expect to run into teams celebrating a win or licking their wounds for a loss.  but it is still a great atmosphere. and one i am hesitant to take my kid into.</u_review>
<u_review>great service. they really worked with my husband to create a one-of-a-kind gift for his siblings. they turned out great and were such high quality.  highly recommend!</u_review>
<u_review>i love the product, but it takes so long to get your order that i've been late getting back to work.</u_review>
<u_review>are you looking for a bargain on a purse? are you looking for a quick gift? new sheets and towels? kids clothes? this is the place to check out!!!</u_review>
<b_review>just crappy mexican food the best part was the mexican flag in my food. but this a disgrace to mexico in every way possible. every single menu item taste the same.  the salsa is watery and nasty. don't waste your time.</b_review>
<b_review>i was bummed when they closed the original julio's on indian school. anyway, i finally went in here recently to discover it's not just take out - they actually have tables and lower prices - awesome mexican food!</b_review>
<b_review>julio's too is a great place to get your tex-mex fix quickly & satisfactorily. the menu is really big and there are a lot of vegetarian options. i give them a high rating because the veggie taco salad has to be one of the best i've ever had, and i've eaten a ton of taco salads. they put real romaine lettuce in it, a ton of freshly sauteed veggies, a light sprinkling of cheese, good black beans, and a nice healthy dollop of fresh & good guacamole. i also had a green corn tamale which was alright, but the sauce (which you have to pay extra for but is totally worth it) is amazing - it's flavorful, thick, comforting. the tamale itself seemed a little dry, mushy, and bland to me. i didn't really like the free chips (too thin) & their free salsa (boring flavor) didn't impress me much.</b_review>
<b_review>this is one of those places where you go by default.  it's late. or it's lunch. nothing is nearby. very few things are open. julio's is right there. it's cheap. why the hell not?  this place is pretty damn solid.   it's unhealthy. it's delicious. it's the perfect "after party" food. catch my  drift?  service can be a little slow, but whatevs.</b_review>

<text>yummy pizza and ok wine, but not a place for large groups.   i went the other day with my wine/book club. we had made reservations but when we got there the hostess told use that she could not seat us till  of our group was there.  unfortunately when we were finally seated the table did not accommodate the size of our group. it would have been really nice to not have to worry about this and instead be able to come in sit down, enjoy a glass of wine and wait for the rest of the party to arrive and relax more. (i would have drunk more wine btw.) i know that there were a few issues with the orders too, although my order was correct.  maybe it was an overly busy night, short staff or poor organization?? anyway, i would go back if someone else wanted to go there but it would not be my 1st choice.</text>
<u_review>i got banged again last night and it was great! we went to big bang to wait for our friends to meet up with us, and ended up staying for almost the whole night. our server, shelley was awesome! she let us know when a bigger table became available and i was never without a drink in my hand. the crowd was completely into the show and it looked like everyone was having a great time, not a sour puss in the place.  the performers are all so talented they even rocked paper planes by mia!</u_review>
<u_review>took my kids here last summer and although my older two (11 and 9) were a little too old and "too cool" for it  and my two little ones (4 and 6) loved it! their favorite things were painting the castle and playing with the sand light box. my favorite thing was watching all the kids take on life roles in the grocery store and restaurants. it was amazing to see how quickly and easily they all chose a job and fell right into it without conflict or questions.   i was just recently back for yelp's pley date event and i have to admit it was more fun as an adult sans children ; ) i always climb the tree house with my kids but climbing it with my adult friends was a blast! we will be visiting again this summer, at least my little two and i will be!</u_review>
<u_review>we went here after the rainbow festival and it was such a great place! the food was great, the service was awesome and the patio is a great place to enjoy your meal! bliss has made it to my list of places to eat downtown!</u_review>
<u_review>we have been here several times and love the atmosphere and how clean it is, the kids also love the arcade. we have recently discovered that they offer $1 games on sundays so it is all the more reason to go get our bowl on. although i am still a fan of the old school bowling alleys this place isn't too bad ; )</u_review>
<b_review>their pizza is very good. i love the fresh cheese they use. i am also a fan of all their salads. they have a full bar, which is always a plus. the outside patio is small but nice and faces one of the main roads throught the santan mall. it has always been clean.  my only negative comment is that sometimes the host's have attitude problems and are not good at getting people seated. the wait staff has always been nice.</b_review>
<b_review>went on a busy friday night, and opted to sit at the bar instead of waiting 15 minutes for a table. the bartender was more than friendly and quick to take our order. the best part of the pizza was the brick-oven char on the bottom of the crust- mmmmmmm.   the menu was limited (pretty much just salads, pizza, and dessert), but that's all you really need at a pizza joint, right? the atmosphere was nice- looks like they were going for a more upscale atmosphere with the white linen napkins and small dining area. it all works together well and i enjoyed my dining experience, but not sure i loved it enough to head back here over my other favorite pizza places.</b_review>
<b_review>if you are in a hurry, go somewhere else. i definitely understand that things get busy, and we got there right before the dinner rush. however, our pizza came out and the next one that was ordered in our group didn't come out until we were finished with our pizza. they also got the size of our pizza wrong, and told us they were adding a personal size to our order to make up for it.  that pizza didn't come out until the others in our group were done with their pizza. really unorganized, but they were very apologetic and offered free dessert.   pizza was pretty good though- fresh mozzarella and their tomato sauce was yummy.   also- no wifi available. they had it, but it was locked and only for their use. seriously, it's nearly 2011. in the age of yelp, and checking in via foursquare and facebook, it's just bad business to not have wifi available for your patrons. even if you keep it locked but give a code so you're not sharing with the entire outside world.   i would go back, but it wouldn't be a first choice if i'm wanting pizza.</b_review>
<b_review>good pizza and good service. the pizzas is thin and delicious! the crust was a little tough but perfect if you are a dipper. they have a full bar and awesome beer on tap. if you're going for your birthday sign up with their "club" prior to going! they offer a free large pizza for your birthday :)   ok so as much as i liked the pizza there were a few cons... it was a little loud to hold a conversation. my girlfriends and i were at a 4 person table and we had a hard time hearing the other person if they weren't directly facing them. i brought my 3 yr old daughter along; there was no kids menu offered. no big deal since she could just share but they didn't have that many kid frendly toppings (my daughter wanted ham and pineapple). the pizza is priced with a base price ($12-$18) and then you're charged for every topping you put on ($2-$4). this made it pretty expensive if you like your pizza loaded. there menu is very limited. just a list of pizza base size with a list of toppings, calzones but still have to choose all your toppings, and a few salads. also, it took a long time for our one pizza to come out (maybe because it was a saturday night?).    good pizza... not the best i've ever had... not sure its worth the price.</b_review>

<text>cheap good drinks, good sushi, great happy hour, decent location. not too shabby.  be advised, get their early as this place does fill up fast on certain days.. (usually thursdays and fridays)! the patio is for the smokers, so if you are a smoker, you will be happy to have your own little section. oh and the dj is pretty damn good to. especially on fridays :)</text>
<u_review>although the neighborhood looks a little suspect, the bowling alley is nice, clean, and the staff are friendly. i was here for a ynpn phoenix event and everyone seemed to have had a good time. i may have to come back with some friends and do some more bowling. the bar even has happy hour from 4-7, so come drink, bowl and be merry!</u_review>
<u_review>i have been back numerous times over the past year and thefood and service has always been excellent. there happy hours are fabulous and there live bands on friday nights make for great people watching. this really is my go to place to meet up with people and i plan on becoming a true regular in the next few months :-)</u_review>
<u_review>i had mini date night and we decided to come here on a whim. i mean it is close to my house so why not. plus they have reverse happy hour and their boneless wings were on special in which they were half off all month with any drink purchase. score. my friend decided that he wanted to try the eclipse burger challenge in which included 3 half pound angus patties, topped with 4 strips of bacon, cheddar and swiss cheese with crispy onions and a side of fries. if he finished it, he got a t-shirt and his picture placed on the wall. well he finished it with no problem. he doesn't eat like that all the time and he said that he was full but not overly stuffed. kudos to him. it looked amazing and i so wanted a bite, but alas he had to finish it all himself. hmm maybe next time i will try. lol ( not!)</u_review>
<u_review>this review will be short and sweet. i promise!  i was able to have breakfast here with the guys as our weekend was coming to an end and it was pretty darn good. i ordered the pancakes with scrambled eggs and extra crispy bacon. yum! dennis ordered the mardi gras omelet with fruit and i swear the is the second time this weekend he had mardi gras something. the first was mardi gras pasta over at pappadeaux. hmm i see a theme lol. jd ordered eggs and chicken sausage and let me just say i have never heard the word sausage sound as naughty as it did with these two around. even our server steven was blushing by the time we left.  all in the the service was good, the food was good and the company was awesome.  i will have to come back and try lunch or dinner one day soon.</u_review>
<b_review>geisha hh sundays cannot be beat... i am officially a geisha groupie/whore coz i love this place! the music's always happening and the drinks are plenty cheap and constantly a-pouring, i swear if i could choose my heaven i think geisha would be it... (hmmm that can either mean i wanna party it up or i am that crassy?)! anywho, i celebrated my birthday at geisha last october and got myself the largest karaoke room available to fit my guestlist of 20. now, they say that the room can fit 20 but i think they fail to mention... maybe 20 skinny japanese not 20 american adults. lol. i got the room for half price since my bday was on a sunday (i later found out and not sure if it has always been but you can get a karaoke room free on your bday, score! not for me =( )   anyways, karaoke room at half off with some free apps, and a server that handled my group's orders, and with all day hh going on and 2 hours of fun and bad singing = hella good fun! i loved that the total of the bill split amongst people came out to around $210 excl. the room, lots of cocktails were had and soooooooooo many orders of teriyaki ribs. and this is why i adore geisha, the apps don't suck, the rolls are yummy, the drinks delicious and the atmosphere cannot be beat. i always rave about this place and i think the consequence is that this place gets even more crowded every sun i come here. still in love with you geisha!!</b_review>
<b_review>if you can handle usually sucky parking conditions, consider making old town scottsdale's geisha a go go your next go-to spot for happy hour.  i've been really impressed with the great deals the still-trendy (despite being open about 4 years) restaurant and bar offers. not to mention, the space boasts private karaoke rooms, which makes it stand out that much more.  every day, from 4-7 p.m., all appetizers, house maki, sake bombers, specialty drinks, seasonal wine and sake infusions are half-off. that's a ton of menu items!  definitely check out the specialty drinks. there are so many to choose from, and they all tend to be very strong. the last time i went there, i started off with the cutely named kinky kooler (usually $9, at happy hour $4.50). it was sooo strong, with bacardi dragonberry mixed with fresh kiwi and lime juices and garnished with kiwi, my favorite fruit. it was too strong for me (i'm sort of a wimp when it comes to alcohol), but if you like kiwi, it's an obvious choice.  i tried my friend's turning japanese (usually $10, at happy hour $5), which i liked a lot more. it had a very refreshing taste to it, with stoli gala applik, peach schnapps and organic apple, pear and lime juices and was garnished with pear slices. i'm sure it was still strong, but the sweetness balanced it out perfectly.  i also had the hello kitty (usually $10, at happy hour $5), which you just can't go wrong with. it's a pretty pink cocktail with skyy citrus and japanese strawberry soda and fruit-infused sake, garnished with a strawberry. it tastes delicious, and how could you not order something with as cool a name as that?  i've also had geisha's sushi before, which i thought was delicious. and you can enjoy all the cheap eats and drinks in a vibrant atmosphere, both for the high-energy ambiance and people who go there. it's your typical old town scottsdale, pretty people crowd, and the bar is bright green with giant pictures of musical icons, connected to a cool patio. happy hour was packed, so stake out a spot early and get to noshing.</b_review>
<b_review>i took my boyfriend here for some sushi and drinks on a sunday night and it was great. when we got there the hostess said there was a wait of about 30- 45 mins so we just sat and had drinks at the bar and jammed to  the music. then about 15 mins later a table was ready for us and we were drinking and eating. my boyfriend ordered lettuce wraps and 3 plates of different sushi and i ordered fried rice, i dont really do sushi, and he enjoyed every last bite. for drinks altogether we had one sake bomb, one matini, and 2 crafts of flavored sake and for all the food and drinks it only cost about $40. im really cheap but i thought that was great considering all the food my boyfirend ordered.  the only downfall was that i left my sweater at the bar after we relocated to our dining table and when i realized it was missing it was nowhere to be found.</b_review>
<b_review>i've been to geisha a few times now and i'm a huge fan. they have delicious, creative, fattening (yes, i like cream cheese in my sushi you haters), funny named, fantastic sushi rolls. one has fritos on it for god's sake...this place is all-american.   i won't go into detail on how amazing the sushi is, but it is. lots of things to choose from and if you're not a super big sushi person, this is prob a great place to try out b/c the rolls are very mild.   my fav part of this place is their infused sake. you get an entire carafe for $8...great deal in old town. i've had mango, pineapple, pomegranate and apple. all were good, but mango was the best. they also have some delish cocktails that knocked me on my ass pretty quickly...highly suggest. another perk - the waitresses are actually really nice. skanky, yes. but extremely nice and helpful. i don't expect that from a place like this in old town.   great people watching and great music plays throughout the bar/restaurant...give this place a try, you'll like!</b_review>

<text>in all seriousness, i have heard good things about this place from several people, i kind of walked in and was trying to think what the hell was the theme here, seriously if peta ever went in here they would close this place down, with stuffed animals on the walls they would have a field day. i would say from start to finish i was thoroughly not impressed. i will honestly say that i will probably never go back to this location. it wasn't even that the food was just blah, but the fact that the staff seemed to ignore me, maybe i was under dressed for this establishment. i guess my money truly is no good here, because i honestly did not feel the staff gave two fucks about me the whole time i was there. garbage. i grabbed a card on the way out from i believe was the hostess. torri mcfarland...you and your staff from the top down got work to do this place sucks!!!</text>
<u_review>i reserved a car....went to go pick it up and they said my credit was to low to rent from them....when the hell did they run my credit...scam. i rented from hertz no problems...never will use budget.</u_review>
<u_review>this place sucks, not my normal car wash, but was in a hurry and needed to wash my car. they did a horrible job for a $20.00 car wash. and i don't think anyone there spoke english. everything in the shop was overpriced.  had been here once before, and i could not remember why it had been so long...now i remember. rip off!</u_review>
<u_review>so i use to live by this place 10 years ago when it was pink peppermint thai. and i use to love to go there. i would say that the place has not changed much. but it also isn't what it used to be. the menu's definitely needs a work over, all they did was black out the name and re laminate them. the prices i feel are a little high, but you did get pretty large portions for the amount. i enjoyed pretty much everything i had but i will say this about the chicken. i tasted a bit freezer burnt. but for the most part it was descent. also the dishes were not as spicy as i remember them. i asked for an 8 on my spicy chicken curry and it tasted more like a 3 with the spice. we had the chicken on a stick and the chicken seemed a bit dry. all i can say is this place was ok...chicken needs work. same old pink peppermint. think it has gone down hill a bit. also i was with my fiance and her 3 year old daughter no kids menu!</u_review>
<u_review>i have been coming to jerry's for over 6 years. the food is always great, but there service has gone down hill. there use to be a waitress there named laura she use to work late nights, since she has left every time i have been there the service has been atrocious. i went to night, was tiold i could not sit in my section i wanted to, i know from this point on it was going to be trouble, so as i sat down i already knew what i wanted. so when she came to ask us for drinks i told her what i wanted to order.  she took the order, and the food was done fast, it did not have the extra cheese on it, i ordered, i got everything but the sink omelet. and the whole time i ate my food this women never came back tot the table once to check on us or refill our drinks. in fact we had to ask her to come by to get the check. worse service i have ever had in the 6 years of visiting this place. this place lost a good waitress when laura left. food is still good but the service is garbage as far as i am concerned!!! definitely hurts your dining experience when the service of a place you like goes way down hill!</u_review>
<b_review>bad food and terrible service.  went here during restaurant week with a large group of friends and everyone was disappointed.  the service was slow and disrespectful and i'm not sure i would have fed my rubber steak to the dog.  i'm not one to go out of my way to write a bad review unless the place really deserves it, and sadly this "steakhouse" certainly does due to the quality of food, price and service. don't do it, try city hall.</b_review>
<b_review>we were a little early,so we sat in the lounge while waiting for our table. the bar menu looks great...need to go back and nosh in there sometime! anyway, our meal was wonderful. our server was a little stiff, not very warm, but...oh well.sometimes i wonder if they get annoyed because we don't drink alcohol...we spend $ on the food. we had the caprese salad(excellent), i had the tenderloin with poached lobster and my husband had the sirloin. both steaks had amazing flavor and sear to them. the lobster was succulent! we shared a side of the mashed pots...best restaurant mashed i've ever had. finished with a creme brulee and blood orange sorbet with biscotti...both very tasty and perfectly portioned. i've been in the restaurant industry for years...including fine dining. had our server been just a little bit more personable, i would have rated it a 5. we still tipped 25%...but a smile now and then would have been nice.</b_review>
<b_review>sat night, reservation 830 pm.  yeah, they closed my favorite ruth chris on camelback so ended up here.  now i remember why i only went here one time and wasn't in any rush back but its been several years, so.....  not great service at all.  shocking for such an upscale place.  had to ask for water to be refilled, dude for $200 are you kidding me?  also had to ask from more bread, never offered.  even at postino, or places like that a water glass never gets as low as mine did.  not cool.  it was not that busy btw.  the servers assistants or busboys or whatever they are were non-existent.  picture on the wall was crooked---sorry i notice stuff like this, ok manager?  where are you?  at the old ruth chris (been there at least 15 times in my life), the manager would always come by and check on tables, i saw none of that here.   ****the steaks do not come out sizzling like at ruth chris****  big let down, no show when the steaks come out and you have to hold your napkin to protect your face from the sizzle.  the steaks here were boring.  seriously.    the kona rub thing did not make up for my steak being lamely cooked, it was well done enough for about  1/2-3/4 through the steak and the rest was pinkish, and i don't like that, not did i finish it and giving such slow service too discouraged to send back at that point and kind of just wanted out of there.  one would think at a upscale biltmore steak house they would have this down perfectly, not everyone likes medium well or rare.  i ordered well done, partially we'll done, rc never f-ks up my steak.  lackluster service and anti-climactic $50 steak means i won't be back.  i still don't get the lame service?  its gone down hill for sure since my 11/25/08 visit.   bummer.   ps i am reading my old review and noted and do remember the steak did come out sizzling back then?  what changed?</b_review>
<b_review>i've heard great things about the food but i was disappointed. we had a reservation, arrived on time but were not seated for 20 minutes. service was friendly and knowledgable but it took forever to get our entrees - about 45 minutes after our appetizer was finished and gone. i ordered steak oscar and i'm pretty sure they had grill running way too hot - my steak was crispified on the outside and rare on the inside. the desserts were the highlight of the meal and they had a good selection of wines by the glass. my first impression: overpriced and overrated.</b_review>

<text>not gonna lie, i don't stay at nice hotels very often - as a matter of fact, if i do it is because someone else is paying and as was the situation at the westin kierland; perhaps the most lux resort i've ever had the opportunity to visit.  from the top notch linens to the concierge who pretty much thinks of everything, from the immaculate grounds to the gym better than the sort you pay for at home the place certainly has it all, but at a price - and then another $25/day "resort fee" tacked on for good measure.  don't get me wrong, i like the luxury - but i don't need it - and if you're going to charge me on the front end then please don't nickle and dime me later.</text>
<u_review>better than most, actually, in that they have a set 'flow' that people seem to follow.  sure the post office is never going to be a 'good time,' but at least this one is tolerable.</u_review>
<u_review>compared to previous experiences with jiffy lube this one was actually quite pleasant - no long lines, efficient employees, no 'upsell,' and a television with working volume controls in the lobby.  interestingly one of three independent former ohioans in the lobby while i waited (3/4 people - what are the odds) we talked about the buckeyes while our respective cars were drained, lubed, vacuumed, and given a 20 point check by the staff and thirty minutes later i was back on the road; for me that is worth paying a few bucks more - though the synthetic blend at jl is still the same price as full synthetic at valvoline back in ohio.</u_review>
<u_review>pleasant staff, no real wait time, and conveniently located close to home.  while i fully admit to being high maintenance in some ways i keep my hair a relatively simple process - just follow what is there, keep it even, and charge me less than $20 because whatever is left from president jackson is your tip.  one star off for forcing me to listen to pop music for 20 minutes, but otherwise not too shabby at all.</u_review>
<u_review>coffee:  the same nutty blend served at the sf flagship and refilled even more astutely i particularly appreciated the low acidity, rich body, and availability of all 3 artificial sweeteners plus sugar.  at $2.25 for a cup that is literally bottomless i could see this being dangerous if i went on a day when i was with my books to read.  blueberry cornmeal hotcakes:  at $10.95 this is the menu item i would have ordered during my visit to the original had the chocolate chip pumpkin french toast not been a chalkboard special and true to the rumors the hotcakes did not disappoint.  golden and crisp on the exterior with a slight bit of grit to the interior crumb each of the three cakes was packed with bursting blueberries and slightly buttery even without the addition of extra.  served with a side of pure maple syrup (the sort they charge you extra for at matt's) if there is a better pancake in the valley i'd be surprised.  cinnamon roll french toast with a side of grilled ham:  a $12.95 chalkboard special requested without the cream cheese icing my dining buddy this lovely dish featured a house made cinnamon roll cut lengthwise, then sliced vertically, and finally dredged in rich vanilla batter before a trip to the skillet.  golden on the outside, cinnamon sugar caramelized within, and served with a bowl of fresh fruit plus natural maple syrup and grilled niman ranch ham i'm pretty sure it would have been better with icing, but it was pretty darn good without while the ham was rich, moist, and suitably smoky without being too saline.  southwest biscuits and gravy:  a gift from the kitchen described jokingly by the owner as "something you won't find in san francisco" this small sample of one of the chalkboard specials featured a rich and flaky biscuit topped with smooth gravy rife with jalapenos and red peppers plus chorizo.  clearly not a dish terribly concerned with being subtle i really enjoyed the texture of the biscuit and although my modest midwestern tongue needed copious water to quell the heat i actually enjoyed how the bright acidity of the peppers helped to keep the gravy from being too thick and heavy.  cinnamon roll:  at $3.50 this cinnamon roll would prove to be good, but when compared to the rest of the meal really nothing special.  served warm with the frosting slowly cascading down the sides of the buttery bun it is not that there was anything 'wrong' with this dish - it just was not nearly as good as the french toast interpretation even though it was equally amply endowed with butter and cinnamon.  blueberry white chocolate streusel muffin:  one of two daily muffins and perhaps the steal of the morning at $2.50 this dense muffin was not only large in size but huge on flavor.  served halved and warmed with a bit of cornmeal interspersed in the otherwise rich and buttery batter the highlight of this muffin was the smoothness of the white chocolate and how it melded with the rich streusel topping to form an ample foil to the sweet and tender berries.  one of the better blueberry muffins i've had in recent memory it took restraint to not order the chocolate chip coconut variation on the muffin as well.  peach cobbler crumble cake with whipped cream:  while i guess i could fault the service here in that they originally forgot the whipped cream i cannot and will not do so because in all reality the addition of house made whipped cream to this $5.50 slab of cake was the very definition of gilding the proverbial lily.  beginning with a batter as light as angel food yet unmistakably imbued with plenty of butter and sweetened local peaches what truly made this cake stand out was a tan ripple i can best describe as cinnamon butter cake running from edge to edge and a lightly toasted topping equally rife with the aromatic spice and just enough sugar to caramelize.  bite for bite this was probably my favorite dish of the morning, but showing a bit of restraint given the day of eating yet to come i was glad to let some of it go home with my friend - to call the portion 'generous' would be an understatement to say the least.  the verdict:  bearing in mind my obvious predilection to breakfast sweets over breakfast savories and the fact that i'd been told all the bay area's recipes had been ported over faithfully i had no doubts that walking into dottie's scottsdale that i would like the food; what surprised me most was how much i enjoyed the scene and the service - both equally well carried over from san francisco.  having said before that dottie's is one of the very few breakfasts i'd actually wait an hour in line for and living in a city where it seems everyone is willing to wait hours in line for matt's big breakfast i personally see dottie's true blue café as a sort of breakfast ideal - food good enough to wait in line for, but without the line.  i'll definitely be back - and likely at the exclusion of wasting a moment of a bay area vacation time or waiting in line at matt's ever again.</u_review>
<b_review>i went here for a staycation one weekend kind of out of the blue.  i mainly picked it from the pool reviews and awesome pictures.  i have to admit, i was not disappointed.  this place is beautiful and not to mention huge.  it was really nice walking around the property at night...i actually felt like i wasn't in phoenix for a minute.  something i really liked too is that they have a 24 hour pool.  psh...awesome.  they also had a bar on your way out to one of the patios and it had shuffle board which is only a positive.  laid by the pool all day saturday afternoon, the guys that walk around are awesome.  just know that they close the pool and the bar at 6pm...weird.  but it is amazing to spend the day by the pool and have people wait on you hand and foot by a hotel.  it wasn't full of kids, but they were there.  it's just a good place if you want to relax to spend the afternoon.  no unce unce, but there is music in the background so that was coolio. i loved the night atmosphere because it was quiet and laid back which is exactly what i was feeling.  if you're looking to party this probably isn't the spot, but if you're looking for an amazing relaxing weekend....this will do it 100%.</b_review>
<b_review>while i've been to the westin kierland for various occasions including drinks and dinners at deseo, extravagant events in the ballrooms, and most recently, phoenix cooks, tonight is my first actual overnight stay at this huge resort.    centrally located just a quick walk from kierland commons, and dog friendly too, there's nothing negative i can say about this place!  friendly staff all around, heavenly beds, and so much more to explore...  minnie and i are hanging in the room (with an incredible view i may add) while jared is partying it up in one of the ballrooms, but we plan on taking full advantage of our staycation here tomorrow... i'll be checking out the fitness room, the pool (if the weather cooperates), and maybe even room service.  i plan on updating, but until then, i highly recommend this beautiful resort.</b_review>
<b_review>great hotel, did a staycation here recently and it's a beautiful property.  as a starwood member they put us in an upgraded room and with a beautiful view and we enjoyed the pools, lazy river and watching people maneuver the flow rider.  they have a few restaurants on site but their crown jewel "deseo" was closed until september or october..bummer as we were hoping to try it.  christine at the concierge desk knew it was our anniversary so she sent up champagne and strawberrys for us to enjoy!  very nice! we were up early to enjoy coffee and watch the golfers tee off just after sunrise. would definitely return, it's a top notch facility.</b_review>
<b_review>the lobby is gorgeous here cuz you see the nice green golf course in the background.  the pool is dirty as hell cuz i broke out with a nasty rash.  please add more chlorine.  the rooms are nice and clean even though we had a cockroack as a roommate.  if a fire were to break out in this hotel there are no stairs or elevators to escape.  its like a maze trying to find your way out.  i wish they had vending machines so i can buy a coke.  overall great experience for the price i paid.  if you are paying over $200 a night to stay here you will probably be disappointed.</b_review>

<text>the service here has really gone downhill. i love the concept of whole foods and the range of options given. being a vegetarian/vegan, this is one of the few places that you can come for a whole range of options. the produce here is always great. plus,i also enjoy the smoothie bar and the pizza that they will put in a to-go box for you.  however, there have been 2 times now where i have had lackluster service, sometimes even downright rude. i have come to expect this at lesser stores but not at whole foods. one male cashier that we had did not even acknowledge us the entire time he was scanning our items, but instead told awkward inside jokes to his friend who was bagging our groceries. he didn't talk with us through the whole transaction and after the bags made their way into the cart, he shouted "later!" like a surfer dude and resumed chatting with his bff. this is no way to treat the customers of your store, especially when we drive way out of our way to come here.  yes, i returned even after the aforementioned experience, thinking it must be a fluke.  so...yesterday we went and again were treated rudely, by guess what? the same guy. this time he was bagging the groceries and did such a poor job that my husband had to stop and re-do it himself on our way out. he was in such a rush that he couldn't bag our groceries properly.  it's too bad. please fire this man. (curly, blonde hair). he is terrible and gives whole foods a bad name. i will be going to the new one on camelback from now on.</text>
<u_review>love the location. location is everything to my husband and i. close to 2 parks, 2 coffee shops, pita jungle, a japanese friendship garden, first friday art walk, and some charming historic districts. this place definitely has a nice neighborhood feeling, and we like living in the middle of it all. our dog loves the park, as well as meeting lots of other doggie friends. downtown is central, so even though i work in the east valley and my husband works in the west valley, neither of our commutes are very long. we live on the top floor and have a wonderful view. wood floors in the kitchen and bathroom are very nice. when people come to visit they almost always remark about the wonderful greenery and architecture of the area, which is what attracted us to it in the first place. they are not your typical beige, stucco phoenix apartments. after living here for a year, there have been some minor complaints. people drive very quickly in the parking garage in the c building, which makes for some scary encounters at times. there was even someone skateboarding in there that actually ran into our car. the solution would be to put some mirrors on each wall so that people can see each other coming around the tight corners. don't know why they aren't there already. another complaint would be that our neighbors were playing loud, obnoxious music several nights in a row. but this could happen anywhere, it's not the apartment's fault. they have recently made some updates to the front office, the courtyards and the public spaces that are very nice. we just signed up for another years' lease, so i will update after that.</u_review>
<u_review>great place to see a ballet! get fancy, go out to dinner, and then see a show here! only giving four stars because i think the place could use some updating (carpet, sculptures, etc.)</u_review>
<u_review>i can see why this place has a less-than-stellar rating. i went on a thursday for a little afternoon pick-me-up. the location was easy to find and the drive-thru was easy to maneuver. however, the service is what gives them a 3-star rating. i pulled up and did not receive a smile from the barista, something that starbucks usually prides itself on. the transaction was "quick and dirty", in fact i didn't really know the transaction was over, he just walked away from the window. hmmph. less than impressed, but hey, at least i got my goodies :)</u_review>
<u_review>i'm a new fan of chop shop. i loved the fresh-pressed juice, and the protein plates are delicious and filling. i had the "slim" juice, and a tofu teriyaki plate. the tofu was a little bit soft and flavorless for my liking, but i ordered some extra soy ginger sauce  which made it more palatable. the forbidden rice and vegetables were very good. it's the kind of meal that leaves you feeling light & satisfied. my husband's chicken peanut bowl looked even yummier than mine did. i would definitely come here again for lunch and try some more items off of their menu. the only downsides- parking nearby is somewhat hard to find, and good luck coming here on a weekend morning, the lines are out the door!</u_review>
<b_review>last night i had the worst experience at this whole foods, and unfortunately it happened right after a very nice experience with a sweet, patient, and knowledgeable young lady at the cheese counter.  thank you naomi for you kindness and your spot on cheese suggestions!  as for at least one member of their management team, i can truly say she seriously lacks in the customer service area!  this is what happened.  as i passed by the registers i noticed one of their signature black sample tables.  on it was an open clam-shell container with 2 cookies inside.  i grabbed a cookie and proceeded to go to the produce section.  a few minutes later i was finally ready to check out.  as i was placing my items on the conveyor belt, a short woman with short brown curly hair and black glasses about 15 feet from me began to yell.  i looked up to see what the commotion was about and realized she was yelling at me.  "ma'am... ma'am, just so you know" she exclaimed bitterly, "those cookies were not samples!"  i was so shocked and at that point everyone within earshot was staring at us.  i said i was sorry and i offered to pay for the cookies, and she retorted nastily with "if you want to."  the bag girl looked horrified and i was thoroughly humiliated.  at least the cashier realized i made an honest mistake (i found out later that i wasn't the first one to make it) and tried to redeem their store's reputation by reassuring me "it was ok."  however she didn't appear to be surprised by this woman's ridiculous and senseless behavior.  i wonder if she makes a habit of berating customers and her employees?  a customer from the other side of the next register actually came around to offer me comfort after this vicious verbal assault.  in taking the cookie i made a blunder but i already had over $80 worth of groceries in my cart, it wasn't like i was trying to get away with some kind of cookie heist.  this manager should have handled this situation in a more professional manner.  she should have approached me in a kind and informative manner (smile preferred) and brought the error to my attention in a normal conversational volume.  it is bad business to publicly and uproariously mortify paying customers!  bottom line, i will not ever return to this store!</b_review>
<b_review>more like whole paycheck market.    looking for a way to lessen the mental anguish i feel when i think about where my burger comes from, but not ready to abandon my hypocrisy and actually become a vegetarian, i've been looking for sources of meat, poultry, and pork that actually have some standards regarding the humane treatment of the animals in our food chain (aside from their eventual slaughter, of course).  i'm also lazy and prefer one-stop shopping.  after reading some positive information on their website (and hoping it's at least partially true), i headed to whole foods to check out their offerings.  first off, their seafood selection was really incredible.  since i wasn't going to be able to cook it in the next few days, i settled on some frozen salmon filets certified by the marine stewardship council.  that means they can charge $7 for an 8-oz filet.  off to the meat counter.  i purchased flank steak for $15/lb.  first off, i would like to know why flank steak is ever more than free.  it's a crappy cut of meat in my opinion, but works well for slow cooking.  i also purchased stew meat for $9/lb.  stew meat!  another crappy cut of meat.  needless to say, i did not buy steaks at wfm.  what about pork?  again, ridiculous prices for chops.  chicken?  i did find prepackaged chicken for $4.99/lb.    i did not bother checking out their organic produce since i'm more than happy to consume pesticides like my forefathers.  and wasn't there a big stink lately about some of the frozen produce at wfm labeled "organic" actually coming from china? a variety of other items also made their way into my cart totaling $188 for very little.  needless to say, wfm will not be a grocery store i frequent regularly, but with their pretty amazing selection of seafood, prepared foods, cheese, locally made breads, i will be back occasionally.  i'm a fan of the store, just not their prices.  as for beef, i found a ranch in arizona that makes monthly deliveries to the valley and charges half of wfm without the middle man.  sorry little piggies in your crates and chicks in your cages, i'm still looking:(</b_review>
<b_review>great day for some food shopping.  came in on a sunday morning, there was crowds and only 3 registers were open with long lines.  they did not notice and did not open up a 4th register. need to have a quicker response time when lines form.  the staff is friendly and especially the meat counter guys.  they are quick and prompt to getting you the serivce you need.</b_review>
<b_review>they screwed up my favorite salad - at least today. the smoked mozzarella pasta salad entered the realm of the inedible and found its way into my garbage can. if i lived closer, i would have returned the poor excuse for lunch. the issue was that they undercooked the main ingredient - the pasta. the tubes were hard and the salad was loaded down with so much mayo that it seemed like i would have been eating mayonaise salad had i continued down that path. also, the hatch chiles they claim that they put in the salad could not be tasted and the cayenne pepper kick that identifies this salad was not there either. my first week in phoenix has provided lousy pizza, food poisoning, bad bagels and now my favorite salad has been tarnished forvever. with the size of the bowl of salad in their case, plenty more people will likely end up angry the next 2-3 days.</b_review>

<text>if i could afford it, i would come here every day and order their blackened salmon salad.  roasted corn & red bell pepper salsa, edamame beans, tomatoes & multigrain tortilla chips with a balsamic dressing.  my absolute favorite, hands down, and it pairs well with their arnold palmer.</text>
<u_review>with a bogo coupon in hand, i showed up at their grand opening and laid down a to-go order for a cheese steak and a chicken parmesan sandwich.  excitement was in the air, and the employees were very accommodating and friendly, offering me a complementary beverage while i waited.  entering the homestead with a fresh crisp planet sub paper bag, the family gathered round for the unveiling of goods from this long anticipated sub shop.  i harvested 2 foil wrapped sandwiches and a free chocolate chip cookie from the sack.  salivating, as i unwrapped each sub, i laid them on the kitchen island, deferring the first bite to the wife and daughter.  here are our critiques.  1. planet sub only offers a 'made from scratch' whole wheat bread for their subs. 2. the cheese steak sub was more like a fresh version of a cheese steak sub, with raw green peppers in place of sauteed ones. 3. i'm not hating, but the chicken parm sandwich had a very strange chemical taste to it.  after nearly ten minutes of deliberation, my daughter accurately identified it as 'tasting how a sharpie (or dry marker) smells'. 4. my wife thought the cookie had a similar chemical taste to it as well.  i look forward to returning and ordering a style of sandwich more inclined to a whole wheat roll.  they do offer 9 different veggie subs as well as salads.</u_review>
<u_review>in case you're wondering, my favorite sales associate, samantha, works here at performance.  and if you ask her, she'd say that i'm her favorite customer (unless she's just patronizing me).  i've been here on many occasions, and am always greeted upon entering the premises.  i purchased one of their bikes (scattante is their brand name) during a huge sale, and walked away with a rather nice deal.  another great bonus is the performance club, where you get 10% back on anything you buy, towards store merchandise.  they have a great selection of biking shoes, including my current favorite brand: sidi.  these shoes fit like a glove, but that's probably because they are crafted from fine italian leather.  and they stand by their product.  i returned a defective headlight, and nate (whose face recently became acquainted with a mountain trail) traded me up to a better item at no charge.  and if you happen to catch glenn, ask to see his urban assault bike.  very impressive and not for the faint of heart.</u_review>
<u_review>not only do i like their burgers, but their bruschetta chicken sandwich is tasty and filling.  sign up and get a free burger every year on your birthday!</u_review>
<u_review>i ordered the large awesome balsam balsamic salad, and it was fabulous.  spring salad mix with marinated mushrooms, roasted red peppers and balsamic chicken.  it came with a unique balsamic dressing, and made quite the impression.  two words... love it!  my wife ordered the ace of clubs, which is a club sandwich with avocado.  it comes a green chile mayonnaise, and there was very little green chile flavor.  she wouldn't order it again, but would definitely go back to try a different sandwich.  we tried the apple blueberry cobbler, and were kind of surprised when we saw it come with a classic oatmeal crumble top.  we prefer a crust topping.  every entree that we noticed servers walking by with, looked delicious.  the wait staff was very friendly, and so was the manager, who was making the rounds, checking on customer satisfaction.</u_review>
<b_review>the reverse happy hour was cool. i ended up getting a little drunk here. the waitress was nice to deal with. the open faced filet sandwich was great. i can't really remember much else about it. the beer selection was alright. if i lived around here i would be a creepy regular and hit on the attractive wait staff.</b_review>
<b_review>we live very close so we come here regularly. spicy grilled chicken wings are delish. we also love the beef stroganoff. service is always good. they have nice happy hour as well as reverse happy hour. decent patio area when the weather is nice! seems to be a bit of an older(retired) crowd, probably due to location. btw, any tips on what they use in the wings?</b_review>
<b_review>i snuck in here on late evening before going out. i ordered off the hh menu. i wasn't overly impressed or disappointed.  the bar was packed with late 40's and 50 yr olds which seemed kind of weird to me. don't get me wrong, party on, i encourage it. it was just weird having 35 middle aged folks partying at the bar on a wednesday night and my girlfriend and i being the only ones sitting at the tables.</b_review>
<b_review>love keegans, staff are always so wonderful and the food is amazing and soo fresh never frozen franchise garbage! love it for lunch or dinner!</b_review>

<text>very great prices for what you get! we got the bbq chicken sandwich, spring rolls, fried rolls, and a beef & brisket soup. we wish they had peanut sauce for the spring rolls. also, the soup didn't have as many veggies as the menu seemed to say it had.   we will for sure be back though!</text>
<u_review>so-so food. nothing exceptional. we had the trout and salmon, and both were just okay. the bread rolls were good, and the salad had a pretty good dressing. the soup was just decent. nice ambiance and location, and the staff was friendly. they should spring for some nicer plates and bowls though!</u_review>
<u_review>slightly overpriced, but very good food and very good service! they are really friendly there, and the food is delicious and fresh.</u_review>
<u_review>yum! i got everything caramel...and it was delicious! i really like the set up of the place. love supporting local businesses!</u_review>
<u_review>this place has a lot to offer - many different choices of jewelry making supplies. however, the staff leaves something to be desired. they are not overly helpful and at times have just tried to up-sell us. i will probably start to try to find a new local jewelry making supply shop.</u_review>
<b_review>i have lived in az for the last 7 years and have tried numerous vietnamese restaurants but all of which fall short when compared to da vang. i mean don't get me wrong the place could use a little renovations and customer service can be improved but once you indulge in their delicious soups, rice dishes, and sandwiches you will be hooked for life. i love this place and i recommend it to everyone</b_review>
<b_review>as the other reviewers have stated, this place is awesome!  i am leaving this review because my hubby liked his bowl of pho so much, he wanted me to leave a review for this establishment.  centrally located, inexpensive and great food.  not much more we can ask for after a long day at the aquatic center and children's museum.  2 stars for parking lot cleanliness and 5 stars for food.  we'd go back any day for the tasty pho.</b_review>
<b_review>i had even looking for a good vietnamese restaurant and came across this little hole in the wall place! service was a little slow but the people there were awesome explained things and were very helpful. food was fantastic!!</b_review>
<b_review>there are a couple of things i forgot to mention--my bad since i was rushing my review.  sorry!  the beef in my pho was very hard to chew, and they aren't very generous with the fresh greens and other veggies that go in the pho--no cilantro either. :( three days later we went up the street to my favorite place to make a comparison---da vang is a solid 3 stars but  no where close to 4 or higher.</b_review>

<text>bleh.  i'm sorry breadfruit, but i will not be back.  i was really excited to try this place when we heard it was opening.  i've said before that i don't like mexican spicy but i do like asian spicy.  i forgot to add that i also like caribbean spicy.  finally, a place in downtown to get some good caribbean/jamaican food.  boy was i wrong.  we met a couple friends here and when we walked in, i loved the decor.  it looks just like the inside of my house with the bright colored walls and the exposed brick and ductwork.  unfortunately, my love for this place stops there.  we decided to order the plaintain avocado spring rolls.  taste wise, these were okay on the first bite, the more you ate, the less distinguishable the flavors got.  it was really just a big mess of mush inside a soggy wonton type wrapper.  the dipping sauce was tasty though.  i ordered the jerk shrimp and it came with a side of rice and beans.  the tails were removed from the shrimp, which was really nice to not have to take care of myself.  unfortunately the shrimp were not cooked very well.  they were quite tough and had this weird crispiness to them.  the flavor on the shrimp was ridiculously overpowering.  i know i am a bit of a wimp when it comes to heat and spice, but this was too much.  i couldn't taste anything besides the spice, even after downing my entire bottle of pineapple soda, which was way too sugary.  everyone else's food looked decent, but overcooked.  one dish, the stew, looked like baby diarrhea.  honestly.  the highlight of the meal was the little breadstick thing they serve alongside the food.  it was pretty good.  sorry breadfruit, i will continue to pass by you in favor of better restaurants like the turf.</text>
<u_review>what do you know, i went back!  the owner was kind enough to email me a while back and we discussed what it was i was unhappy with, he gave me some recommendations based on my tastes, and he sent me a gift certificate to try them out again.  this time around, instead of a dismal one star rating, i find myself wavering between 3 and 4.  i will clarify that i would like to give this place 3.5 but i am rounding up because i have never had chicken as juicy as i did the other night in my entire life.  the husband and i stopped by here right after work, at about 4, and there were a handful of tables already full.  as the time progressed, it became much busier.  i would also like to report that the strong artificial cherry port-a-potty smell i picked up on last time is no longer there.  all i smelled was the food.  we seated ourselves, i glanced over the menu, and i knew what i was going to order.  thanks to reviews from nathan and amber, i ordered the quesapilla as an app, and for my entree, i went with the baja chicken burro per the owner's suggestion.  the quesapilla came out quickly and was already oozing cheese.  i cut it open to share and i couldn't help but stare and watch the cheese slowly fall out.  it was like porn to me.  i have an addiction to food porn.  the taste of it was fantastic.  the cheese tasted great and the crispy/soft shell around it was very nice.  the baja chicken burro (a chicken burrito deep fried and then baked, then topped with cheese and cream cheese sauce) was delicious.  the outside was perfectly crisp, there was just enough cheese, and the cream cheese sauce was perfect!  i was nervous about the sauce because i am not the biggest fan of cream cheese, but this was really great.  it was slightly spicy with a really nice cooling effect because of the dairy.  the chicken was incredible.  it was so juicy and so flavorful i thought i might have a foodgasm.  i can't believe i am saying that about mexican food, but it's true.  they know their chicken.  overall, the food was fantastic, much better this time, but the service was okay.  it started off really strong with our drinks coming immediately after we ordered them, and subsequently our food, but after we finished we were left waiting about 20 or so minutes just to get our check.  i also couldn't help but notice while we were waiting, that this place seems to be so friendly.  the owner knew so many of the customers by name and was genuinely interested in their lives.  it was refreshing to see that kind of friendliness.  i take back my original review, it was very clearly an off day.  my husband and i very much enjoyed our food this time around.  next time i have a taste for mexican food (probably next cinco de mayo week) i will think about stopping by again.</u_review>
<u_review>in case you didn't already know, i am a really picky eater so i am a really big fan of customization/build your own anything.  indulge burgers definitely fit that bill and made me one happy camper as i scarfed down my just for me burger.  the place is situated in an average looking strip mall in scottsdale but the inside is just luxe enough to remind you where you are, but laid back enough to let you be yourself.  they had an arrow on the wall pointing to the bathrooms that simply said, "2p."  there are no fancy scmancy giant menus to clutter your table, simply a paper printout with little bubbles that you can fill in a la standardized testing bubble sheets.  fun.  there is a ton of stuff to choose from, but this is what i got: 1/3 lb burger with olives, carrots, bacon, cheddar, and ranch on a wheat bun.  it was delicious.  never had carrots on your burger?  you should try it.  i also tried the bistro dipping sauce, whatever that is, but found it to be a bit too spicy for my taste.  the burger was delicious, but too big for me to even come close to finishing.  they should consider a 1/4 pound option for the weenies like me.  i also really liked that they served me kettle chips covered in cheese before my meal.  salty and cheese?  yeah, that will make me happy.  this is definitely a great addition to scottsdale where i can find refuge whenever i get lost in the sea of plastic.</u_review>
<u_review>a while back we picked up some sweet italian sausage from the farmer's market and we kept it in our freezer.  finally we broke out the good stuff to make our own bangers and mash and it was delicious!  the sausage is flavorful yet mild and the insides are really tender and they crumble when you cut into it.  you can just tell by looking at it, that this is good stuff.  it also smells wonderful as it's cooking.  i really enjoyed it and thought it tasted great.  i will definitely be sampling more of their meat.</u_review>
<u_review>i've been to this location a few times.  they have a nice selection of lighting to pretty much suit everyone's tastes, but unless you are old and look like you are going to spend loads of money, don't expect any sort of service.  the last and final time my husband and i went here, we were intending to purchase some track lighting.  we actually found some stuff we really liked after about 10 minutes and we waited around that area hoping that someone could help us with some questions.  well, 15 minutes later, that never happened, but new people were helped.  we got in line, seriously, to ask a question.  after our question was answered, instead of sending an associate to help us with our purchase, we were ignored again.  so we tried finding someone else on the floor.  no luck.  apparently, because we are in our 20's we were just window shopping and not planning on dropping a few hundred dollars on lighting.  needless to say, we didn't purchase anything in this awful store, and instead left pissed off.  on our way out we had to resist the urge not to trash anything and everything in sight.  bottom line, go here with your grandparents if you want service, otherwise, go elsewhere.  the worst!</u_review>
<b_review>breadfruit filled a vacuum in phoenix by creating authentic jamaican food and drink for a downtown that has suffered from a dearth of interesting restaurants.   we ate there once several months ago. in fact, i think it was their first week open for business. my girlfriend and i were impressed, and did come back, even though their tasty veggie meat was out of stock, and couldn't make us the veggie meals we came seeking that day.  fast forward to last weekend. some friends scored four diamondbacks tickets, and i thought, since we'll have some drinks at the stadium, why not try breadfruit again? we could take the light rail, and it's only two or three blocks from the light rail station.  we brought a six pack of red stripe to complete the experience, and it was a delight to be back. we saw one of the owners, who we recognized and liked when we met her, but didn't see her partner, who is the cook and is jamaican. our friends were impressed by the food, which held it's own.  we had fish escovich, jerk chicken, coconut curry tofu and side orders of plantains. all hits. everything was cooked to order, and impressed our friends. the steamed veggies and rice and beans on my plate were delicious, and complimented my coconut curry tofu (it's actually a little more like seitan). their byob policy worked well, as we were able to finish off a six-pack and get back to the light rail to head to chase field.  good people, excellent food and an ambiance that is worthy of a downtown phoenix revival. good work, breadfruit. i wish others would take your lead.</b_review>
<b_review>overpriced, especially the drinks. had a reservation, and asked to sit outside, but were told no, even though the seats outside remained empty the whole time we were dining. asked for less ice in my $10.00 drink (yes, ten dollars for one drink that was all ice, no drink) and was told no- that the bartenders could not do that because the drinks were measured 'perfectly'. food was ok, nothing special that i couldn't make at home.</b_review>
<b_review>i had high hopes for this place, and it is really too bad because i love to support the phoenix area restaurants, especially a caribbean one and i had already been to the adjoining rum bar and loved the drinks, but the food was bad.  it was not only bad, but by all means avoid the daily market catch.  it was not fresh at all!  very over priced!  for nearly $25 for a simple white fish they could have at least taken the bones out of the thing.  it tasted like it had been sitting around all day (or two) in its own juices, and when i let the waiter/bartender know he just ignored it and then ignored us until we left.  i will never be back for the food.  the rum flights are worth a trip there, but that is it.</b_review>
<b_review>i love this place.  i absolutely love it.  great food, great drinks, really cool vibe.  i am an az native and love eating down town.  this is the first place i think of when trying to come up with something fun, and delicious that everyone will enjoy.  be prepared for some good spicy caribbean food</b_review>

<text>been wanting to try this place and had the mushroom and bacon omelette which was very good. the cinnamon roll was good along with the meat scramble. one of the better breakfast places we have been to on phoenix, i liked the self serve drink bar and how you can get your items yourself. overall i will come back to this place.</text>
<u_review>classic deli in downtown phoenix, use to be a miracle mile when park central was a real mall. i order the pastrami on onion every time. it is so fresh and good you can't switch to anything else. they are quick to get you in and out for your lunch plus they always provide great service and generous portions. never had a bad meal here. better than getting a burger for lunch.</u_review>
<u_review>always a positive breakfast lunch restaurant centrally located in phoenix.  generally order one of the omelettes which are always made to order with potatoes and toast.  the orange juice is fresh squeezed and awesome.  the restaurant is a nice place where it allows you to sit and talk at your own pace. they set a very pleasant atmosphere where there is not loud music or people talking so loud that you can not hear your own friends across from you .   will keep on coming back as long as they don't continue to do what they have always done</u_review>
<u_review>good authentic chinese food, just need to know what dishes to order and to ask for spicy or non spicy. good peking duck, house special chow mein and tofu with cha sui.  very busy during lunch with downtown customers where they will seat you in a table to share with others. service is always good and prompt with good prices.  pretty clean for a chinese restaurant, you will not be disappointed.</u_review>
<u_review>can not go wrong on anything you order here from salads to pasta to sandwiches and pizzas. the panini sandwiches are healthy, light , tasty. the salads are full of fruit and freshly prepared. the salmon comes with a huge side of veggies that are well prepared.   great service is expected at nordstroms and they go above and beyond in the restaurant.  will always consider eating here when in the area with all the intense restaurant competition around because of the food and service.</u_review>
<b_review>made my 2nd visit to scramble today.  service style is like pei wei... order get a number etc.  decor is bright industrial style, the ubiquitous and pointless tvs everywhere as well.   drinks are all self serve.  it is good to have another breakfast alternative.    previously, i was there for breakfast and had on of the omelets.  good and filling.  took 15 minutes or so to get the food.  2/3 of the menu is breakfast with just a few choices for lunch (3 sandwiches, 2 soups and some salads).  on this visit i had the turkey sandwich and dining partner had a breakfast "gringo" burrito.    we did wait about 15-20 minutes again for the food and the place had only 10 people there.  the sandwich was tasty and came with a few chips ($9).  the burrito ($7)  is large with lots (maybe too much) cheese sauce.  he liked it though.  drinks are pricey ($4 for oj?).  bottom line:  it is a decent breakfast place but i wouldn't go out of my way to lunch there.</b_review>
<b_review>live walking distance away from this breakfast joint and all i can say is nothing but good things. the service is quick and friendly. food: amazing. i've had the waffle, southwestern breakfast burrito, and biscuits & gravy, all delicious! my girlfriend has the eggs benedict every single time- always cooked to perfection. the outdoor patio seating is wonderful & dog friendly (which is a plus for us dog lovers)  oh! and all you can drink coffee too :)</b_review>
<b_review>i drove past this place a few times when heading up to north mountain and lookout mountain to go for a hike. my bf and i love to go out to breakfast so i put this on the short list to go to.   today was the day. we headed up 7th and jumped on line. it was very crowded but things moved fast there and the staff was super friendly.   i couldn't decide between 2 eggs anyway or the pancakes, come to find out i could get my 2 eggs and sub my toast for the choc chip dollar pancakes. score. my bf got the meat lovers' scramble with toast. we grabbed a table and they delivered the food fairly quickly. it got a bit tight in the seating area and people were taking chairs and grabbing them for themselves, leaving other tables without. a little frantic but the food was good. and they had the women's world cup on. bonus!  a great neighborhood place. maybe i'll check out the sports bar and burger place in that plaza as well.</b_review>
<b_review>the husband and i love this place. we have been coming here ever since we moved to the neighborhood and both the food and service is consistently amazing. we have tried most of the breakfast menu but haven't dived into the lunch menu. our favorite is the gouda brizza (breakfast pizza) - smoked gouda, bacon, hollandaise sauce, and scrambled eggs. yum! on lazy weekends, we order this to go and enjoy back at our place. when we dine in, it's a mix. their costa breakfast burrito is delicious - something the husband orders frequently. i really like their mushroom and bacon omelet, but i also enjoy their "two eggs anyway" meal. i normally get scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes, and fruit (instead of potatoes). super delicious and filling. another favorite are the biscuits and gravy. now this is amazing! the biscuits are super soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. they just melt in your mouth! the gravy is the perfect accompaniment. it's thick and filled with sausage. these are some of the best b&gs i've had! the best part is how inexpensive yet utterly delicious they are!   i love that it's a local place that uses local food. everything is fresh and the staff is outstanding. we've taken both sets of parents here as well as friends. this is definitely the go-to breakfast place. if you are ever in the area, you should definitely check it out!</b_review>

<text>used to be a great place to get an after hours burrito.  after seeing the video of the chest-pounding, knuckle dragging bouncer pummeling some patron, we've x-ed dos off our list.  we'd rather eat at the crappy philly cheesesteak place or even pay mickey's ridiculous--"wanna-be night club"--cover for late night eats . . .</text>
<u_review>great location.   great atmosphere.  mediocre (at best) food.   someone please let me know if they ever start serving decent food because i really like everything else about this place.</u_review>
<u_review>5 star location and view.  1 star service.  2 star food quality.  1 star atmosphere.  outside of the outstanding view and patio, i'm having a hard time finding much positive to say about this place.  service sucked. for a restaurant in this price range i'd give it negative 3 stars. waiter was extremely inattentive. we ended up getting more (& better) service from a different waiter. not really sure what our waiter was doing all night since we dined late and the restaurant was nearly empty. our original waiter waited 30 to 45 minutes after we ordered to let us know that the kitchen was out of some items we ordered. this is 100% inexcusable for a restaurant in this price range.  food flavor ranged from bland to unimpressively odd. the preparation of individual items and dish combinations were overreaching, unappetizing and spectacularly disappointing.  desserts where completely underwhelming and generic in options and taste.  to add insult to injury, we were seated right next to a drunk party of 6 (the restaurant was nearly empty) who spent the entire night obnoxiously yelling over each other, constantly using vulgar language.  it was extremely difficult to hear the person directly across the table from me speak. again, for a restaurant in this price range, this is 100% unacceptable.  i'd be hard pressed to return to this restaurant even if it had tgifriday's prices.  considering the prices, i prefer to give this place negative 2 stars. i'll have to settle for 1.  if you want to enjoy the view, simply stop by for drinks.  if you want a great meal and service, save your money for someplace like blt or rancho pinot.</u_review>
<u_review>dear barber,  please go back to measuring school.  1/2 inch does not = 2 inches.  again, 1/2 inch does not = 2 inches.    went in for a trim, asking for 1/2" off the top.  left looking like i just enlisted in the army.  literally.  (google "high & tight") wtf?    i recant anything positive i wrote in the previous review.  dude cuts hair like kobayashi eats hot dogs--fast and messy. when it comes to barbers, speed and frugality is not necessarily a virtue.  not the worst barber on the planet and the other barbers in this shop may be less frugal with their time + more careful with their client's hair, but i am not willing to return to find out in this lifetime.</u_review>
<u_review>simple, fast, affordable mexican.  clean, but nothing fancy--not the type of restaurant for hanging out or meeting friends (no waiters or atmosphere).   similar in quality to frank & lupe's and los olivos. not as good as, but cheaper than los sombreros.  some things are decent, like the enchiladas.  some are mediocre, like the carne asada. some are awful, like the chicken salad.  so place your order and keep your fingers crossed.  great for take-out if you live in old town.</u_review>
<b_review>good atmosphere. lots of tvs and they'll put any game on you want. friendly staff. el diablo hot wings were 5/10 but the fried burrito was awesome!   guacamole sucks though and they charged extra for salsa! what!</b_review>
<b_review>this place has been around for a while and, besides having expanded to include the neighboring building, it hasn't changed much. the service is generally bad, the tacos are good, the picnic tables feel dirty, and it's an okay place to stop in for a beer.</b_review>
<b_review>we came here after an angels spring training game. the yellow banner hanging in right field at tempe stadium that read "dos gringos: a good place for day drinking" was convincing enough. good happy hour, good margarita, decent food, ok atmosphere, alright service.. probably not a place i would visit again.</b_review>
<b_review>3 stars for a dirt bar that knows it's a dirt bar.  there is no dr. jekyll and mr. hyde here, only a cheap hyde that loves to peak at the waitresses' whaletails and a decent happy hour special on mexican beer.  that's all.    i guess my one gripe would be that every guy is a tough guy at this place. really.  i used to have it as my happy hour destination, and it was pretty good for that, but once the darkness sets in, the real scottsdale lunatics emerge!    (oh, and it's obvious that the owners rake in a ton of money and are the greediest bastards under the sun for not changing simple things like the water misters that spew water constantly.  ladies, don't wear anything nice to this place because the seats are stained from the misters and tough guy sweat.)</b_review>

<text>i wasn't very impressed with it at all.  all the renovations are nice, and it was nice to be able to sit and have a beer while i watched the movie but everything else sucked.  the service sucked.  the food sucked. the as to the service, they take your order on a little ipad sort of thing, each person is assigned a seat number...i don't believe they actually record the seat down as the waitress continually brought everything to me. other peoples food and drinks...and checks! ugh. also she brought my 15 year old cousin a beer! wtf! we all received our food at the same time, except for my husband...he had ordered a burger and for some reason it took a good 15 minutes to arrive.  drink service was quick.  the food itself was sub-par. i got chicken tenders. they did not have the taste or texture of chicken. they were really weird.   i would say save your money and don't order dinner here. we will be back, but will only do drinks and light snacks.</text>
<u_review>well i was thinking to myself last night that i would be giving this location a 3.   however, that just went down the drain. last night the hubs and i ate dinner here. i am currently on this strict vegan diet, so i asked the waiter if the black bean burger was vegan. he said he wasn't sure but that he would check. a minute later he comes back and says yes it is. score! i eat half of it and boxed up the rest for lunch, which i will no longer be able to eat because the damn burger is not vegan! i went on pj's website this morning to find out calories and what not, because i track that stuff, they had a whole section listing what is vegan and what is not,and sure as shit, the black bean burger was listed on their site as not being vegan...why the staff doesn't have access to this info i do not know.   so anyway.....our actual experience was ok. this time around all the employees were actually dressed and no goods were hanging out. our waiter sucked. he never checked on us once the food came, never came to give us refills, our plates were cleared away by someone else, a box was brought to me by someone else, we had our credit card sitting on the table for a good ten minutes waiting for the bill. they did get a wee bit busy, but they seriously had about 6 people working that night for that very small location.   i'm not sure what is up with this location. it has always been like pulling teeth to get decent service there. the food is always good but the service is lacking.</u_review>
<u_review>i like pat's pizza plus!   its not the best pizza i have ever had, but its not the worst either. its just right there in the middle good pizza.   the crust is always perfect, that sauce is always delightful. i like to eat in and get a small side salad (while the salad is a bit lacking you get these glorious little rolls made from heaven)   like one yelp-er said, all the off putting signs are a bit much, but i have also witnessed the type of clientele that go in there and have been tempted a few times to bitch slap someone for their oblivious rudeness to the employees of pat's.</u_review>
<u_review>well, hello there captain yummy!   the hubs and i met up with the mother & sister in law this past sunday for brunch. we must have gotten there at the perfect time, 11 a.m., as there was no wait and we were seated quickly. when we left around 11:45 the line to be seated was insanely long.   the food was great! i had the cibatta french toast with a side of bacon and a bellini to wash it all down. the french toast was just lovely. i generally don't order french toast because its usually to soggy, but not at postino's! it was a slice of french toast heaven with a super tasty creme sauce and fresh sliced strawberry on top. the bacon was decent, but no matt's big breakfast type of goodness.   our waitress was on top of things even as the place filled up, our glasses of iced tea never got empty.   we will for sure be checking this place out again!</u_review>
<u_review>i have given this place three chances. why i will never know. each time has been unpleasant   its close to my work and today i wanted a salad for lunch. there were only 3 tables of people, all already enjoying (i think) their salads. so i think it will go fast and i order one to go. 10-15 minutes later i finally get it. no clue why ti took that long. seriously.   so here i sit at my desk, trying to choke down the most disgusting salad i have ever come upon. wendy's makes better salads then this place! i ordered a bbq chicken salad. the chicken is actually grey in color, grey, so i have picked around all of it. the salad is really soggy and i have no idea what the dressing is, but its wrong! just wrong! i'm starving and now out the $9.50 i paid for this bowl of nasty :( i feel like a sucker.   also they asked me if i wanted a roll. i said yes....never got it ;( thanks for ruining my lunch tossed.</u_review>
<b_review>i'm from portland and there are several great neighborhood theaters that have been doing this concept for years.  normally really like the whole dinner and a movie with drinks and all.  wasn't a huge fan of the experience here at amc unfortunately.  service in the theater for dinner was beyond slow.  you press a button for the server and then wait what seems like an eternity for them to finally come.  if you are dying of thirst, you'll be dead and buried before anyone comes to your rescue.  the food was decent though and overall i still like the concept, i just think this place needs to improve their system.</b_review>
<b_review>this is my favorite sunday night movie place. my boyfriend and i only like going to the cinema suites theatre. don't even bother with the fork and screen side (it just isn't as good). the flatbread pizza is yummy and the servers are pretty great. i wish the prices were a little better or had a better reward system.   plus i really wish they had $1 sodas like at harkins... that is my one downfall.   but overall great experience i haven't even tried any of the other dine ins... no reason to</b_review>
<b_review>came for a 2nd time! horrible horrible service! ordered 3 drinks durning the previews, received them 45 minutes later. the comped the overpriced stale popcorn, so that was....a try. ipic is still the place, but this place gets 1 more shot from me. sink or swim, its up to them......</b_review>
<b_review>ok, here it is folks....i've been to this theater before and ran into the escalators being broken down and having to use the elevator(way too long a wait!---not fun)  but the whole idea of the theater's location is a nice one, and yes, the movies seem to be a bit less macabre there and the maturity of the over-all crowd seems to have less crying children than many other theaters.  last night though, i experienced the rank sewage smell (throughout the complex) with a friend (bad smells are the worst and most offensive to me!), theater #13 was filthy and unkempt, and the parking underground was a mess again! i'm sorry, but if i should decide to go on a date any time soon or to impress a friend, i might have to strongly reconsider my theater choices.  possibly go to fashion square in snottsdale (oh well)--at least i know what to expect there!  to me and my friend, the smell was the worst!  sorry, this theater gets only two stars.</b_review>

<text>stopped in for happy hour after reading some positive reviews.  we were really not impressed with the food.   we ordered what the server recommended and it tasted like microwaved frozen food, reminding me of the sort of thing you might get  at a low-budget corporate event.  excellent service and very pretty space but frankly, the worst food i've eaten at fashion square.  i've eaten at their other locations in vegas and beverly hills and i don't remember them being this mediocre, so i'm not sure what the problem is.  it just doesn't make sense to eat here when you've got a half dozen much better options within walking distance.</text>
<u_review>i'll keep this short and sweet.  eight bucks for a chicken pita with lots of chicken and absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  i mean, no flavor at all.  the place is mysteriously crowded.  i honestly can't imagine why.  this is mcdonalds for people who don't want to feel like they are walking into a mcdonalds. like mcdonalds, it's also a national chain, so i'm not sure why people are saying it's "locally owned," or at least any more locally owned than your local mcdonalds.  http://www.zoeskitchen.com/menu.asp</u_review>
<u_review>we're recent arrivals to scottsdale and after a few weeks of over-exposure to the extreme jersey shore douchiness of the local nightlife, we decided we needed something a bit more, uhm, unpretentious.  i did a yelp search for "dive bars" and this was the first one that came up, so we headed right over there to check it out.  it did not disappoint.    nobody in the bar was orange in color, we didn't see a single faux hawk, no midget bodybuilders in affliction shirts and nary a single leased porsche in the dirt field that passes for a parking lot.  i assume that's what the doormen is for because judging by the fellini-esque crowd that drinks there, i can't really imagine who else he might be there to exclude.  drinks were cheap and the crowd had that dive bar "je ne sais quois"  that can't be faked - an ineffable combination of drunkenness and regret combined with wildly improbable hopes that tonight is the night that it will all turn around.  in other words, a perfect place to drink. (insert your favorite tom waits lyric here.)  smoker friendly, to put it mildly. i'm surprised they don't give you a pack of lucky strikes at the door.  while not quite up to the supreme dive bar standards of, say, mac's club deuce in miami beach or boardner's in la, it's a solid in-state contender.  it is what it is. which in a town where a significant portion of the stuff is not what it appears to be is a very good thing indeed.  we like it.</u_review>
<u_review>i am not impressed.  it's positively scandalous that in a city that is 41% latino, most of whom are mexican-american, that there is so much crappy mexican food. i really don't get it.   anyway, there really isn't much to say about this place.  it's a shithole, which i wouldn't mind if the food is great, but that is not the case here.  they are serving up extremely mediocre mexican food.    i had the three taco plate with tacos de cabeza.  the tacos were okay.  the rest of the stuff on the plate was crap.  a tiny portion - maybe an eighth of a cup each of rice and beans, accompanied by a really odd and nasty avocado sauce and a very sad little salad with roughly three tablespoons of mayo.  the price for the taco plate and a large horchata was $9.76.  while not expensive, that's really not that cheap for a place like this, if you know what i mean.  this is by no means the worst mexican food i've ever had but reading these reviews you would get the impression that it's something special.  it's not.  you'd do better at any taco truck in tucson or southern california.</u_review>
<u_review>i wanted to love this place but i'm going to have to give it three stars only.   the market itself is superb, with pretty much every possible ingredient, an outstanding butchery selling every part of the lamb (and whole lambs), industrial sized blocks of feta cheese, etc.  the restaurant is a small kitchen area with maybe ten tables.  the staff is very friendly and accommodating, but frankly, the food we had was good but not great.  the hummus in particular was not garlicky at all. the roasted chicken was a bit dry and the fattoush was, well, to me at least, it was a nice kind of sweet salad, not a proper fattoush.  it was basically lettuce with a bit of tomato and olive.  no cucumbers and no dried pita bread, which is kind of odd since they have a fabulous bakery and the bread was the highlight of the meal.  we bought extra bread to go and i'd go just for that.  but as far as the food, i'd go in the neighborhood but it's not quite the mecca of mezzes that i was hoping for.    and if you want to buy a whole lamb, this is the place.</u_review>
<b_review>so... where are all the slot machines, poker tables and cocktail waitresses? i swear i just walked into a hotel restaurant off of the vegas strip... not even keno at the table. what??   no, wait... where are the 4,000 flavors of cheesecake? this is the cheesecake factory, right??? no???   okay, grand lux cafe is so confusing. i think it is going through an identity crisis because it looks like a cross between a casino hotel lobby and the cheesecake factory, but without any personality.   for dinner on a wednesday night, in this great of a location, i was shocked to see this place so empty. maybe everyone was across the street at pink taco. or, maybe people just do not like being served by a wait staff with a perma-fake smile on their face all night.   the one thing i will say for glc is they have a lot of options. however, i find restaurants that provide such a variety generally have anything exceptional to offer as far as the meal is concerned. i believe this is true for this establishment, as well.   the waitress recommended the vegetarian chopped salad saying she thought it was the best thing on the menu. i found it to be pretty bland and uninspiring. i guess i'm spoiled by the cowboy ciao chopped salad. but i digress.   i would have gotten the tofu dish they have (orange glaze with sesame seeds, i believe) but i was informed that they cook it with a fish sauce. at least the waitress knew it was a non-veggie friendly option, but why serve a tofu dish that is not veggie?   my dinner date ordered the blt with fries. i think she ate about five bites and a couple of fries. she was equally unimpressed. i snuck a fry and they certainly are nothing to write home about. limp and soggy, just the way nobody likes em.   they did have a good riesling a good selection of coffee drinks as well as an expansive dessert menu. we did not try a dessert (they have baked items that take about 30 minutes to cook.. probably pretty good, but i'm on a diet) but my gal pal did order a mocha coffee which she seemed relatively pleased with.   we ended up sitting around chatting for 3.5 hours and they never kicked us out or made us feel bad about not ordering anything else, so i would give them an extra half star if i could (gabi, are we ever going to get half stars?!?!?).   grand lux ... i am going to sum you up into one word: uninspiring</b_review>
<b_review>okay, the food, if not able to feed entire armies, is on the delicious side, but unimaginative. they give fancy names to tired dishes, and the menu is as big as the portions.  the service: did they purchase their waiters from a vending machine?  i wanted a dish that had fried tofu. when i asked if i could have the tofu steamed instead, the server's expression was quizzical to say the least, and she then tried to illicit a description of this "steaming" method. or did she not know what tofu is? silly. she then had to crawl through a chain of command, from chef to manager, to make it happen. hello? you have about 9000 dishes on your menu; i'm sure someone asks for a substitution somewhere?  all in all, i remain unimpressed. more like the grand sucks cafe.</b_review>
<b_review>after passing grand lux cafe about a hundred times, i finally had the chance to check it out. knowing it was a sibling of cheesecake factory, i expected a similar menu. upon entering, it had the same feeling as a cheesecake. we sat down and the second the menu opened, realized, the menu was about as detailed as well! from sandwiches, to dishes from every culture imaginable, this restaurant definitely has something for everyone to choose from.   as the friendly waiter welcomed us, he told us about the menu and mentioned that grand lux focuses on serving different cultural cuisine from pretty much every region around. in one sitting you could try thai, chinese, mexican and italian. yet, it wasn't actually as weird as it sounds. it really just depends on what your taste buds are in the mood for. however, the waiter did warn us that portions were large. how large? i was about to find out.   with so many options to choose from, i ended up going with the spicy flat bread chicken sandwich full of corn, avocado tomatoes and freshly grilled chicken. we had the chicken lettuce wraps to start. the second my meal arrived, i realized that friendly waiter was definitely not kidding when he said the portions were large. i think my sandwich equaled 2-3 full meals. the sandwich came in quarter flat breads and equaled nearly one full sandwich per each quarter. and they gave me four of them! the french fries heaped on the plate as well. i managed to eat one quarter of the sandwich and felt wasteful for not being able to finish the rest, but my waistline is already in a fight with me and the one quarter completely filled me up. however, when we sat down, friendly waiter mentioned the desserts (we should have just skipped right ahead) and said that they took a half an hour to prepare because they were freshly made. who can pass up an opportunity to eat freshly made dessert so beignets it was. true to the theme of overly portioned items, they brought out eight (!!) large fist sized beignets steaming hot and oozing with freshly melting powdered sugar. to accompany them, they gave three dipping sauces. heaven. that's all i can say. it was worth every bite...of the one i had. with six remaining, i wonder who could possible finish eight large beignets unless you are with a group of eight!   after visiting grand lux, i definitely think more highly of it then i did the hundreds of times i passed it and i would absolutely go back again. but, i know now to listen to the man when he says the portions are big! so i'll just skip right ahead to dessert.</b_review>
<b_review>grand lux cafe comes off as pretentious.  it doesn't have the food or service to back it up.  my omelet was a disaster.  egg beaters!!!! come on!!!  my guest ordered the breakfast sandwich.  our waiter did not write the order down and it came out wrong.  pretty atmosphere.  nice high ceilings.  guess what?  i am not going back.  even for the atmosphere.</b_review>

<text>cute store! reminds me of the awesome little french bakeries in nyc. part knick knack store, part breakfast/sweets. i bought an item off the sale/day old rack and it was quite good.</text>
<u_review>great find! the boyfriend and i were aiming to check out geisha a go go's happy hour but no seats and loud music drew us to find a more intimate spot. kyoto hit the spot! the sushi was great at a reasonable price off the regular menu. the staff was friendly and laid back yet still attentive which was refreshing.  i loved all the rolls we tried: (in order of favorites) caterpillar, philadelphia, salmon volcano (warning it is salt that they light on fire), tuna maki, and another i can't remember. although the boyfriend is still partial to roka akor, i think this is my new favorite location! i definitely cannot wait to come back and please open a location in glendale!</u_review>
<u_review>is this a daycare or car rental service? i dropped a friend off who received awful directions from staff on how to get here. when we arrived, i could see why. the place was swarming with children belonging to both staff members and appointments were continually interrupted by screams in the back and interruptions for mommy.  not very professional.</u_review>
<u_review>i love skunk creeks bike/ running path, no cars, lots of other supportive acitve people, what's more to love? even the possiblity of water fountains and washrooms and with over 4 hours put into finishing the trail, i think it's pretty safe to say it's the best for even the most extreme active persons wanting a flat (or hilly optioned) ride.</u_review>
<u_review>it's definately not my favorite tasting chocolate, but it is really cute and it has my grandma's approval. we went on the free tour when she came to visit me and ended up buying a pound of the green mint chocolates for st. patrick's day. she liked them so much though she starting eating them early and had to replace them with a cake in chicago. there are cute activities for kids and some interesting chocolate and popcorn  varieties. chocolate covered jalepano anyone?</u_review>
<b_review>it is really hard to rate la grande orange because there are so many amazing things about it, but it is so hard to find parking.  pros the food is really, really amazing they have an awesome selection of things you wont see day to day they have really tasty coffee drinks indoor and outdoor seating  cons the parking is really really rough they are pricey you have to wait in some pretty long lines  try the commuter with avacado. it's amazing. also, they have excellent chai.. and their english muffins are to die for.  if you live in the area and can walk there, you are set. i used to live a half mile away and would take a walk there for breakfast. the absolute best way to start your day, imo.</b_review>
<b_review>my fav breakfast place in phoenix!  you get: great food, great atmosphere, good service (parking a little bit of a challenge, but i live right across the street so i just walk).  they even have drive up take out service!  i mostly eat the breakfast there but have had sandwiches as well as the pizza at the pizzeria next door.  delicious!  anyone who gives lgo negative reviews has just fallen into the usual boring phoenix restaurant style type eating.  lgo is something different...order and serve yourself....kinda' like fast food (but you have to wait a little bit because all the food is made fresh), but seat yourself and don't have to worry about waiting for a server to bring your drinks/food!  coffee is great (and strong). daybreaker is my favorite healthy breakfast choice (egg white with turkey slices, avacado, tomato and salsa....get with a side of fruit or potato...fantastic!)  yes, prices are a little higher than average in phoenix....but you get what you pay for.  we love coming here after a good hike at squak peak or camelback! fresh squeed oj is great and fresh made english muffines are yummy.</b_review>
<b_review>while shopping around scottsdale fashion square i asked a kind woman helping me where i should go to get some work done. without hesitation she told me to come here. after, i saw some of my friends had glowing reviews for this spot, i adventured my way over.  parking was a struggle (but hey, when isn't it for me in a rental car?) but it was well worth it. you know those moments when you walk into a place so cool and eclectic you just have to walk around and find your bearings before you can sit? that's what my wide-eyed happy self did when i walked through the front door.   there are a few patio spots, but i nestled right in a cozy two person table by the front door to hammer out some work. i went to the front to order a drink and felt like i met some new friends. everyone was kind and so helpful which gave me a lovely home-ee feeling. i went to the wall cooler and grabbed a beer and needless to say, my productivity soared.   i kept smelling intriguing pizza so i had to grab a couple to-go when i left. and... some cupcakes. i got a cheese  and roasted corn with goat cheese pizza and they tasted as good as they smelled. it wasn't a greasy pizza and it had just the right amount of flavor to make each bite beautiful. been to cpk? the pizzas are about that size. want to be completely stuffed? order one for yourself or have a great meal for two. the s'more cupcake was out of this world bursting with goodness. not too sweet, not too cakey, but jjjuuussssstttt right.</b_review>
<b_review>8/17/2013  bfast club uye with many many yelpers today.  great event.  i was very happy that i got the chance to have b'fast with 2 yelpers i have not seen in a while, joan g and meagan g - so nice to see these ladies!     i had the egg-white omelet.  that was fantastically delicious.  a lot of people love their english muffins too and they sell them by the half-dz.  so, i am finally, after 4 years of shopping here, writing a review of lgo.    i love coming here.  everything about this shop screams hipster and i like hipster stuff too.   i love the lunch salads.  their salads are often creative and delicious with fresh local ingredients.  just grab a salad from the cooler in front of the main counter.    i love the pizza.  in fact, the pizza here is some of the best in the valley to me.  the star of their pizza, to me, is the delicious crust!  the crust of their pizza has an appropriate balance of crisp and chewiness.  i have also enjoyed some of their cookies.  certainly the last yelper cookie recipe in july 2013  was the best cookie i've had from their bake shop.  i know they sell wine and a bunch of other stuff.  i always feel like i'm running into stuff on displays for sale in there; but to be honest, i've never paid that stuff any attention.  i don't know what is on those displays in that store.  when i was in there today, i noticed a children's book on one of the shelves and remembered thinking, odd.  but maybe people buy them and read those books whilst they eat lunch. (?).    the parking situation at this corner of campbell and 40th street is typical of most central phoenix eateries - frustrating, limited, best-to-valet - to name a few adjectives.  which is why i normally get what i want from lgo to go.  they have convenient "to-go" parking spaces right in front that are almost always vacant.  i park, run in , grab what i need and come right back out.      until this morning, lgo certainly had a round-up-able-to 5 star rating in my book.. i had to knock them a star for the following two  reasons:   #1 this place doesn't lend itself to large groups at all if you come for lunch or breakfast.  no reservations.  just dispatch your buddies to hold seats with cell phones, napkins and whatever else you can use as place holders.    rcv alert:   #2 they got rid of or lost the tammie coe cake's  red velvet cupcakes.   i came to know tcc's rvc when i stopped in to have lunch at lgo once and that's where my love of tcc's rvc originated.  when i stopped in some time ago and saw the rvc cupcapes in the display.  i instantly knew something ewas off/wrong.  it didn't look like my beloved tcc rvc cupcake.  i inquired about the cupcake and why it looked different.  i discovered that tcc's was no longer being sold there, a person working at the counter told me lgo's rvc was just as good as tcc's.  uhm, houston, we have a problem, that sales person must have fallen and bumped her head!  i don't think so.  i've tried the rvc made by lgo's bake shop 3 times to see if it came close, the cake itself is not as good as tcc's.  the cake itself lacks the appropriate flavor.  the taste is off..  the cake is moist enough, and the texture is just right.  but the lack of enough flavor is where they loose the battle.  the cream cheese frosting is perfectly done.  if their cake's taste popped more, they'd be in a position to take on my #1 rvc in phx.  certainly a contender in my top 5 favorite rvc's in phoenix.  .</b_review>

<text>um, something has happened to this place, and it ain't good. i felt like i walked into a cronenberg film where you don't know if anything is real.  every redeeming quality is now gone. the roaming singer is gone. they have a bar but don't even produce drink menus any more, and the waitstaff can't readily list drinks available. not good when the wife is looking for drinks. the service is awkward and slow, even though they sat us at a table next to at least a half dozen servers who loitered around the kitchen area with the manager. i couldn't tell if they were off the clock or hanking or both.   the only reason we went here is because they take reservations and someone in our party was concerned about restaurants being crowded. the hostess made a point of telling us over the phone that they don't usually take reservations on such short notice, but they would accommodate us. when we arrived, the place was mostly empty. inflated sense of self-importance, much?  the only reason i bothered updating this is because you might be like me: easily conned into going here when you're hungry. well, resist the temptation and insist on going elsewhere.</text>
<u_review>this place is quite popular in casa grande, especially since they added the sushi counter. it gives all the urban ex-pats something trendy to do without driving up to scottsdale.   still, as jeremy mentions, everything is pretty much mass-produced and any of their dishes can be obtained at any other generic chinese restaurant. there must be a chinese food service that provides this stuff. i've tried the sushi and it seems unremarkable to me, although i'm not sure i'd know good sushi if it hit me in the head.  the owners are nice and there's a bit more atmosphere than, say, panda express. but i'm not sure the food is any different.</u_review>
<u_review>things have improved a little bit at this safeway since last year:  - there is a bit more selection. - they are fairly responsive to concerns and there seems to be at least one manager roaming around at all times to ask if you need any help.  some things are still very bad:  - the produce situation hasn't improved. there is still bruised, over-ripe produce everywhere that goes bad within a day of purchase, or is already bad. - the baggers are still recklessly inattentive and will bag dish soap with bread, milk on top of produce, and so on. they literally don't even look down... they just toss items into bags randomly until each bag is full.</u_review>
<u_review>nice enough.  shocktop served with orange, check. friendly servers, check. steak prepared to the proper doneness, check. sports on the tele, check. if that's all you look for in a chain steak restaurant, you might as well quit reading and just go.  still here? oh. the cuts of meat aren't what i'd call great. fries should not, i repeat, should not, be affected by gravity when you hold one end. also, what happened to the fine art of presentation? i noticed this at olive garden as well. can we make a bit more effort than placing a steak perfectly in the middle of a round white plate and sending it out? how 'bout a little garnish or something?  no pride these days, i tells ya.</u_review>
<u_review>revisited macayo's for a family birthday -- based on my past experiences and subsequent one-star review, i was wincing at what we might get.  the food is still blah. as i mentioned in my previous review, it's cafeteria-like and nothing worth writing about (ah, the irony). it was properly temp'ed, so there is that.  however, we seemed to hit a bit of a jackpot, server-wise, which can make up quite a bit of ground. our server was a very nice person -- very attentive, nice to the kids, and hooked the birthday-person up with the free sweets and singing. i did see the manager wandering around and then sitting at a booth chatting with someone -- she did not acknowledge us even though i made eye contact with her a couple times as she walked by. i've always sorta liked the whole wandering manager asking if everything is okay bit, even if it's a gimmick.  a solid three stars this time.</u_review>
<b_review>romano's tries hard, and i give them credit for that. this wasn't a horrible dining experience. probably closer to a 2.5 star. but it certainly wasn't fantastic. i ordered the carbonara and despite it being "hand made" and fresh and including an egg on it, it just didn't hit on all cylinders for me. it was rather light on flavor. part of that is my fault for ordering carbonara: a dish i'm always more disappointed in than i remember.  service was decent, though our waitress wasn't aware that they apparently served orangina. "i think they're just decorative." me: "they're in 24-packs stacked up in between those huge tables there. i think they're for sale." (they were.)  overall, you get what you expect here, and i wasn't expecting much. mission accomplished, though my mother enjoys some salad thing they do, and again, it wasn't *awful*. it just wasn't great.</b_review>
<b_review>don't know if i like the changes made.. not sure if this is an overall company decision or just this location, but it seems like when we come here now, the prices are higher and the portions are dramatically smaller.  the reason why i say this is that we usually order the same thing when we come here, and the last time we did, we paid $60 for our meal and i was still hungry. that should never happen. i find myself coming back just to give this place chance after chance to improve, but i keep finding myself disappointed and hungry.</b_review>
<b_review>if i could give less than one star i would. first off i was in the place for over 2 hours and waited to be seated for over 10 minutes. when we were seated service was lagging but expected being as management obviously did not schedule enough servers for the night. we spoke with the couple next to us the urged us to leave being that service was terribly and slow. we waited and sat it out due to the amazing specials finally we were approached and our first order was taken. after our order was taken everything was terrible. no one at out table ate their order, and only 3 out of 5 plates were complimented for the check.  i think the manager took us to be young and stupid and did not take us seriously (although i'm sure we have higher credit scores and income than he). i can guarantee you a group of asu students have a lot of power and influence and that i will never be back.   tables throughout were left dirty and disgusting. let me stress i will never be back. i. will. never. be. back.   i accept that the manger rudely declined my offer to speak with him (probably because we were young). this was rude and ridiculous. i will be calling in the morning. i am done with macaroni grill, as long as everyone in our party.   thanks for nothing and for charging us. you should close this location or fire the managment team. they're doing nothing but losing money.</b_review>
<b_review>just fattening dish after fattening dish... nothing turned me on besides the dirty martini which was still under average( i can say this cause i have had my fair share of good martinis)...  just blah in my opinion....not sure how i even ended up here.  just not a fan.... i can live w/out ...  two stars..one because im a kid at heart and like drawing on the tables with the crayons they provide..and the second star because well ,sheessh.. guess im just a nice gal.</b_review>

<text>can i tell you how much i despised fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit? i should have known the second i realized that bliss/rebar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.  and so it is. we showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. there is no hostess or even a hint of one. we stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? the place was dead.). we were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. um, it's 40 degrees...  and the place was dead. i guess we'll wait. we go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. the server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. that's sure inviting, isn't it.  so we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so i go with the veggie sandwich. that sounds innocuous enough, right? the food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. my "veggie" sandwich arrives and it looks like a filet-o-fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. i couldn't help it - i asked the server what the hell it was.   eggplant.  ohhhhkay then.   it was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. impossible. the pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. only jenna jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. my companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. there was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. i wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although i almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.  so, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes mia. you'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. nope. no. nada. had to chase someone down and ask for it. when it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low i couldn't check it out. i was so over the whole experience at the point i didn't even care. i left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours.   just ugh in every way.</text>
<u_review>hit or miss, for sure -- some days, it's part old lady; other days, it's scottsdale girl cast-offs. they've taken a bunch of my old shit and don't totally give customers the shaft on trade (unlike its emo counterpart, buffalo exchange). there's a lot of nice, current designer jeans, and a decent cashmere section. indeed, there is a sprinkling of designer bags, but they're either beat to shit, four seasons old, or a knock-off. so yeah. it's not a super duper awesome place on my constant rotation, but i like to stop by if i have time, and it's a good place to unload my old stuff.</u_review>
<u_review>the outlet mall in anthem gets its own self-serve yogurt shop. i discovered this by accident on the same day they were having some mall-wide special, which was opening day for said yogurt shop. pandemonium. i admit, this probably biased my opinion a little bit. lots of confused people, lots of "wow... you do it yourself! what a great idea!", as if this was somehow a new concept. maybe in anthem...? the lines were wicked long because people insisted on redeeming their 10% opening day coupons (that saved you, what, fifty cents? way to go, champ!), but that gave me lots of time to eat the pieces of kit kat off the top of mine before i paid. (come on, they don't weigh anything compared to the yogurt.)  so yeah. these yogurt places are pretty much all the same, except for yogurtland (next to sprinkles) which is far superior, but it's nice to have the option at anthem which is otherwise a deep-fried, extra cheese covered monstrosity.</u_review>
<u_review>oregano's, you are vile, and i am baffled by your crowds of followers who seem willing to loiter about in 115 degree heat for over an hour for you. everything tastes as if someone had an accident with the salt shaker in the kitchen. bland, boring, and dehydrating. no thanks.</u_review>
<u_review>i don't know what ohso is trying to be. the spiffy name and sleek exterior make you think you are in for an inventive, trendy experience. the interior, though, is a little modern, a touch industrial, with a heavy dose of down-home midwest, sort of "modern barn" as my so eloquently deemed it. there is a good beer list, but it's not insane. the menu is pretty standard, but the inclusion of a children's menu threw me for a bit of a loop, especially since the median age of the patrons there appeared around 50.   the place was moderately busy, but service was sort of spotty. i tried a couple of their specialty cocktails: good but not great. we started with the green chile dip, which ended up being what seemed eerily similar to spicy hummus, just served hot. the "flatbread" on the side (essentially pita) was accompanied by potato chips. just.... odd. not bad, just odd. the grilled cheese was good and the ingredients fresh, but nothing to write home about. the fries were tasty, probably because they reminded us both of mcdonald's. the small side of bread and butter pickles was amazing - the best part. we ordered the apple pie a la mode, with cinnamon ice cream. the dessert was amazing, really, although there was a heavy dose of peanut butter which really threw us off. turns out they were out of cinnamon ice cream, and subbed in the pb version on the fly. probably would have been nice to know on the front end....  overall, a solid "meh". i love seeing unique places like this pop up in the neighborhood, but i don't know that ohso has enough panache to survive...</u_review>
<b_review>my long overdue debut at bliss/rebar came after a wonderful night at the theater. the evening mild and the company superb, it would have taken a major misstep in service for bliss to get anything less than 3 stars. fortunately, the service was first rate. and having hop knot on tap certainly didn't hurt their resume.   i enjoyed the music and the atmosphere was inviting with a sense of community. while i didn't eat i did watch with jaw slightly agape as my tablemates snacked on hearty macaroni and cheese with bacon, coconut crusted chicken fingers and parm-dusted french fries with marinara dipping sauce. no shame in that game.  i'm looking forward to going back when it's a bit busier and i can get a better read on what's what. oh, and i'll be dancing with those chicken fingers.</b_review>
<b_review>should be called: miss/sub-par... maybe i'm being a little harsh.    the menu is snooze. they need a better beer selection asap!!!! $6 for a can of guinness... that must be a guinness record for overly priced.  i knew the menu better than the waitress!  um, welcome back?   2 stars for turning 905 into something slightly better, aka less pretentious.</b_review>
<b_review>i decided to give bliss/rebar a second chance. on my first visit, i ordered the bliss burger and found the amount of cheese combined with the heaviness of the bun, really over powered the burger itself. so last night, i met a friend for dinner. i started out with a glass of their malbec. i was very impressed with the quality and smoothness of the malbec! we got some parmesan garlic fries to share. they were just ok. i thought it was strange that they were served with marinara sauce. next, i ordered the mac and cheese with bacon and chicken. it came out piping hot and oozing with cheese. normally i don't complain about the amount of cheese, but just like the burger i had, both dishes had way too much cheese in comparison the other ingredients. i did however enjoyed the slight spicy kick that the dish had.   i guess i would come here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.</b_review>
<b_review>solid 3 stars...was thinking 3.5 but the server seemed a little distracted and disinterested.  the night was awesome. perfect for sitting outside. as i walk up i notice the host podium is vacant and walk to the front door of the restaurant and find myself holding the door open for 2 of the servers as they were walking out with food and i continue to walk in looking confused on who i tell i am here so i can sit and be served.  one of the servers came back in, and i asked if we just seat ourselves to which he advised that i could find a spot i like and he would follow me.   after some though i ordered the loaded burger and the shoestring fries with sea salt and vinegar. while not fond of the cheese sauce, it was good, but i would have been more content with a slice of sharp cheddar or crumbles of bleu cheese. the bacon was crisp and generous and the patty (cooked medium) was thick and juicy. like everyone else has mentioned, the pretzel bun on the burger was great.  i was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the sriracha slaw provided with the burger enough to put some on the burger itself.   the fries were nice and thin...where was the vinegar? ehhh, not in the mood to bring it to their attention i enjoyed them with just the sea salt.   the portions are generous as i found myself taking half my burger home and more than half of my fries.  overall i enjoyed the ambiance, proximity and can see myself coming again to hang out on the patio now that the temps are more cozy.</b_review>

<text>a tad bit disappointing...   my newest pet peeve is waiting for a table when i have reservations. a recent occurrence happened this weekend when i showed up five minutes early for my 830pm reservations and was finally seated at a table at 850pm. the accommodating hostess did present us with two glasses of rose, but when we sat down, we realized we weren't that special because everyone else around us were also served complimentary rose...   the meal was off to a decent start with the lamb riblettes and paprika cured pork belly. the glaze on the riblettes was slightly sweeter than my palette likes, but the flavor on the lamb was really wonderful. i was surprisingly pleased with the pork belly. i have gotten to the point where i swore off pork belly for so long because no one knew how to 'wow' with it. a fatty piece of pork can do well on its own, but i like to think the kitchen tried, and the staff here did an awesome job. i had also never had sarga turo, and really enjoyed it with the pork belly and golden beets. we were again slightly disappointed when a new couple sat next to us and was advised of a drink and entree special for the night that our server neglected to tell us.  the most disappointing part of the meal was the main course. we both ordered fish for our main since we had red meat for our appetizers. the yellowtail looked very dry as it was sat on the table, and its texture was the same. the chilled tuna was slightly better, but unimpressive.  my date later pointed out that the yellowtail served to our neighboring table was both cooked and plated much better.   i feel like this place has a lot of potential, but definitely has more room for improvement. i may give it another go, but i'd have to be convinced it can be done better next time.</text>
<u_review>this place used to be my favorite sushi place when i first started going about 9 years ago. as the years go by, the quality, freshness, and taste of the food has failed to please. i used to recommend this place to friends and visitors, but now i can't even get myself to go in there for a meal.</u_review>
<u_review>amazing customer service and sushi. mediocre robata items.   i had the best birthday dinner here about 3 weeks ago. the couple who brought me here had been here 2 other times, so i knew i was in for a treat. we sat at the sushi/robata bar, and since the menu was just so vast, we decided to do the omakase and let our chef bring out what he thought we would like. we told him we wanted to do mostly sushi.   the amount of food we got was insane. i had never eaten so much in my entire life. the quality of their fish was outstanding. i was really impressed. here's just a list of the things that we were served: butterfish tataki with white asparagus, beef tataki with a chili ponzu sauce, fried tofu with avocado and wasabi mayo, burnt tomato salad, fried oysters with ponzu and shisho, 2 large toro tuna rolls, 2 kinds of spanish mackarel sashimi, tuna sashimi, yellowtail sashimi, sea bream sashimi, butternut squash tempura, yuzo marinated black cod, grilled wild madagascan tiger praws, grilled pork belly, cold soba noodles in broth with quail egg and green onions, baby pork ribs with sweet corn in butter and soy, and grilled shishito peppers with ponzu and bonito flakes.  are you still reading this?!? we were so incredibly full, and they said they had some lamb cutlets for us too. unfortunately, we had to turn them down and ask for dessert.   side note: the manager, william, knew we were there to celebrate my birthday, and he actually gave us a traditional shot of japanese sake. the drink was dry, and really smooth and was served in a tall shot glass placed inside a wooden box. it is customary to pour the sake so it overflows into the box for prosperity. when done sipping on the shot, you pour the remaining sake from the box into the glass and finish it.   back to the incredible dessert. we waited a good amount of time for our dessert and we were wondering why since they typically offer a sorbet. when they finally brought the dessert out, we were all amazed. not only we were served all the flavors of sorbet, but also an assortment of fresh fruit. here's another list: mangosteen, cherries, strawberries, kiwi, green tea custard w/banana foam, peanut butter sorbet, and yuzu sorbet. my hands down favorite was the yuzu sorbet.   overall, this place offers the best customer service, and they have a great selction of fresh fish. the items that were grilled were inconsistent. sometimes it was overflavored, and other times the food was bland. i can't wait to go back here and just eat some sashimi.  i would also highly recommend the blood orange margarita and honeycomb shochu!</u_review>
<u_review>one * for location. another * for the calamari taste, but not a really decent portion.  the seats hurt my ass. the drinks aren't that delicious. the food is too fusion, and it's not a very good fusion. the first time i ate here, a friend of mine and i stopped by before i dropped her off at the airport. she ended up spending  majority of her plane ride back home sitting in the bathroom.</u_review>
<u_review>i drove by this restaurant last week and remember thinking "wow, that font style is very fox concept-y!" lo-and-behold, i wasn't wrong!   my friend and i had dinner here on saturday night for her going-away farewell. we were told by the hostess that the wait would be 5-10 minutes. i ordered a home-ec martini while we waited, and it was okay. i love basil, but i'm not sure if i could get used to it in my drinks. the size of the drink for the price was a bit disappointing as well.   for an appetizer, we ordered the soft pretzel and it was amazing!! the provolone fondue with the soft, warm pretzels were so delicious! my friend and i were really surprised, and impressed. the chicken tortilla soup was also really good. there were small chunks of tomatoes in the soup that had just enough spiciness. after two impressive starters, i was excited for my coq au vin, but i was actually really disappointed. the sauce was way too sweet for my liking. the vegetables and chicken were cooked well, but it was pretty difficult to put down the sauce.   although we waited much longer than 5-1o minutes for our table, the service here was pretty good.</u_review>
<b_review>came in on a saturday night.  the new restaurant makes you forget that it was ever a ruth's chris.  the staff was kind and when we complained about the cold, they adjusted the temperature and checked in on us.  the place is spendy, and you will spend more than at cph.  the cocktails are about 12-14 and listed more absinthe and pernod than i had seen in a while.  the manhatten while served in a martini glass (so that it looks itty bitty) has enough alcohol in it to fell a buffalo. the appetizers include riblets and a wonderful avocado filled with goat cheese and roasted garlic.  not something i see everywhere and delicious.  had the octopus salad (which was good but not memorable, mostly octopus, grapefruit, mizuna and fennel bulb) and the classic chop which you can get at cph and cowboy ciao.  but that salad is so good i find myself trying not to eat directly from the shared bowl.  the filet, scallops and ribs were all a hit.  the one miss was the meatloaf.  was expecting it to be really homely and comforting, but found that one a bit dry.  overall, will be coming back.  it's nice to have another fun restaurant option on the c.corridor.  going to get dessert next time too, but was too full!</b_review>
<b_review>we decided to got to the gladly for restaurant week. i'm so glad we did! my boyfriend wasn't sure if he wanted to select off of the menu for restaurant week but after looking at it, it was a no brainer! we both decided to start with the original chopped salad (same as cowboy ciao), how can you go wrong with this salad!? amazing. then he had the buttermilk chicken breast and i had the pan seared scallops. the chicken had such great strong flavors that worked really well with each other and the scallops were the best i've ever eaten! the desserts they had to choose from were the peach cornmeal cobbler and the buttermilk bread pudding. since there were two to choose from and two of us this was a no brainer and do one of each and share. both were very good, but i did enjoy the buttermilk bread pudding a tad more.   i highly suggest stopping in and doing a dinner date night!</b_review>
<b_review>so we went for arizona restaurant week and you should know, the appetizer and dessert are half portions.  the entrees seem to be full though.  the chopped salad is awesome.  i love it at cph and its the same here.  my friend had the tomato bisque which is fine - just reminds me of chef boyardi ravioli sauce minus the little bits of "meat".  the chicken dish is awesome.  its a bit small, and spicy but the potatoes definitely even it out.  i would definitely go back to have some more of that.  the meatloaf wasn't as impressive but its a solid and savory offering.  definitely don't need ketchup.  :)  the peach cobbler had some grainy powder on it that i didn't care for.  maybe they should've gone more for doughy crumbles versus the weird dry powdery crumble.  the creme fraiche had no flavor.  the bread pudding was much better.  way better than a lot of other attempts that i have had.  i was sad to see ruth chris go, but was impressed with the redesign.  they might want to help visitors with the south entrance though, its a little disconcerting to walk through a glass door that almost looks like it should be locked and the place isn't open.  that leads down some stairs and leads you to a hallway with restrooms and a bar.  the hostess on the other side of the room so she doesn't see you when you walk in..  i kind of wonder if people are really walking in off camelback?  anyway, my rating would really be 3.5 but will round up for great service and nice atmosphere.</b_review>
<b_review>great new addition to the biltmore area!  i knew it had to be good when i heard it was the same group that did citizen public house!  amazing service, great decor/atmosphere, lively crowd, and delicious food.    we started with the roasted brussel sprouts over grits - truly amazing...bursting with flavor and the grits were ridiculously creamy.  i enjoyed the chicken...moist and amazingly flavorful - only wish it was served with a veggie too!  my husband tried the meatloaf and was pleased with his choice...not amazing, but solid.  looking forward to coming back for happy hour at the bar sometime to enjoy one of the martinis that looked so good!</b_review>

<text>this place looks like would be good, but sadly, it is not. the portions are huge, and the food is very generic. we won't be returning here unless someone else wants to go here!</text>
<u_review>first time review: great place! our server was italian, and the food was true italian (reminded us of our trip to italy last year). it is a bit pricey, but the food is definitely worth it!   second time review: decent service, although some of our orders took a while to come. calamari appetizer was large and very good. the beet salad was delicious! both of our meals were good, but they were a bit too creamy.</u_review>
<u_review>pretty good chinese food! we've been here a couple of times, and both times the food was good. they give you wontons and a salad right after you order, and the food we had as leftovers heated up very nicely! it tasted almost as good as the food did when it first came out.  great lunch prices!</u_review>
<u_review>love the fresh food here and the changing menu! we also loved the complimentary amuse bouche, cotton candy, and take home treat. the music and atmosphere was wonderful.  our absolute favorite was the cold corn chowder soup - to die for! we also very much enjoyed the delicious doughnut dessert.  for dinner, i ordered a scallop dish. the scallops were cooked absolutely perfectly. they were a bit salty. the rest of the dish was very interesting, although i am not sure if i can say that i loved it. it was good though, and it was presented beautifully. my boyfriend ordered the pasta dish with egg noodles. he enjoyed it - i just thought it was so-so.  very nice wait staff as well!</u_review>
<u_review>very great prices for what you get! we got the bbq chicken sandwich, spring rolls, fried rolls, and a beef & brisket soup. we wish they had peanut sauce for the spring rolls. also, the soup didn't have as many veggies as the menu seemed to say it had.   we will for sure be back though!</u_review>
<b_review>i made reservations here for a first date before reading other reviews. and after reading other reviews i was concerned we wouldn't have good service. but that opposite actually happened. we had excellent service!!! our waiter jason was very attentive and courteous! the ambiance was pleasant. the environment a little noisy but for my girl and i it didn't bother us. we had a romantic time! after we ordered our food it was ready in 15 minutes and warm on the plate. the salmon was good, didn't care for the rice that came with it. my girlfriend got the chicken parmesan and loved it. we shared the spumoni for desert and loved it. we forgot our coupon and receipt but will be back another time for sure.</b_review>
<b_review>this resturant is like right down the street from fashion square sorta. a long ways down that one street but yeah. its the big monsterous resturant on the corner near that frank lloyd wright tower deal-ie bug. yeah so they are kinda expensive and while they offer portions that are overtly large, i found it bland and not so good overall. i wouldn't really recommend it at all... unless i don't like you then have at it!</b_review>
<b_review>i took my father and little brother here last week. all three of us had fantastic dinners. my brother had of all things one of the best filet mignon's i have tasted in a long time. my father had a side dish of phenomenal asparagus spears. i had a perfectly seasoned seafood pasta dish, not too creamy, or salty leaving room for the flavors of the shellfish to emerge and blend into the sauce.   the service was excellent. there were no tables available in the dining room and the cocktail waitress did her best to make us feel like were not in the bar.   i could be a "chain restaurant" snob and rip this place apart but i can't.... everything was very good. i would definitely recommend it for a quality meal with friends or family.</b_review>
<b_review>good food, great service.  for the gf'ers out there, they many options--the food-servers can request most items to be gluten free.  not much variety for strict vegetarians, though.  atmosphere is classy and friendly, but noisy.  the  pork dish my wife had was very good, the lobster that i had was a bit overcooked and the risotto was a bit crunchy.  would definitely go back--the salad was incredible,</b_review>

<text>great fresh salads and fresh new flavors for their slice of the day.  perfect for lunch inside or outside on the nice shaded patio.  plus i love it when you tell your server you're splitting something and they do the work for you and bring it on two plates.</text>
<u_review>best place for lunch!  five dollar glasses off their wonderful wine menu, plus the brushetta is off the charts, and the chicken salad is the best i've ever had!  would eat there everyday if i lived closer.</u_review>
<u_review>coffee and fresh cookies are great.  the staff is always smiling and i love being able to see the clean kitchen where my food was cooked from scratch.</u_review>
<u_review>had a heck of a time finding a box that has flexible schedules, great coaches and get this childcare!  and not the, "heres a room to lock your kid in while you workout" childcare, but the omg this is like my son staying with grandma for an hour childcare.  the community here truly wants you to succeed, not just by being able to lift heavy things, but also eat better, feel better and include your family and friends while doing it.  thats right, i said community, because its not just a box!</u_review>
<u_review>this place is a little out of my way, but when i'm visiting the folks in mesa we come here.  the fish/shrimp tacos are good, as is the carnitas plate.  great mexican place to go to if you are trying to watch your carb in take.  not a huge fan of the salsa or margaritas.  love the outdoor patio seating.</u_review>
<b_review>every review talks about the good food but let's start elsewhere, the bathrooms.  the bathroom is unisex sinks with separate doors for each stall.  each room has it's own theme and music.  i love the creativity in something so often overlooked by most restaurants.    i've been here twice and had a great experience both times.  the first time i got the italia salad.  it was very large with lots of meat and cheese.  it was very tasty.  i followed that up by an ice cream sandwich which was at least 4x too big for me.  the cookie was fresh and warm with the ice cream wedged in between.  i say that baby is fit for 2 large adults or 3-4 people that know their limit.  the 2nd time i got the italia sandwich.  it was fantastic.  the potato salad i chose as a side was good too.  too often places overcook the hell out of the potatoes and it turns into mush.  theirs still had some texture which was nice.  it was a very satisfying meal.  we chased our dish with their signature espresso which is a micro latte (two baby lattes).   i love the uniqueness of the original brick wall, and the exposed wooden trusses that make up the roof.  even the seemingly simple light bulbs are unique with a hoop-earring looking filament within them.  they have a brick oven for pizzas and a huge display for those tempting deserts.  in addition to the espresso bar they also have a nice selection of beer and wine.  this is a great lunch spot in an area of town not known for independent and unique dining options.    worth the drive from tempe.  it often is quite busy but they are good at cleaning tables and reserving seats for people in line.</b_review>
<b_review>this area of gilbert is so quaint!  but even if i was in love with its surroundings, we always stop by when we're in the mood for delicious desserts, specifically the red velvet cheesecake, which is indescribable.  you just have to try it!  as for the regular food, i've tried a different entree each time, and i have never been disappointed.</b_review>
<b_review>great foods and selection of drinks! i also love their system.  they also have awesome bathroom.  i love the way i can see their cooking.</b_review>
<b_review>my advice. go with the fresh brick oven pizza, the sausage was succulent, the ricotta sweet and the crust perfect. the sicilian style pizza i can not say the same for, it is a generic cheese thick crust already baked up an when someone orders toppings they simply slap them on and reheat the pizza with the toppings. leaving the crust overly crisped like biting into a crouton and the toppings only slightly warmed. anything that is made to order is a winner! anything pre made and waiting such as sides, sicilian, cake can be skipped without missing much.</b_review>

<text>full disclosure - i am not a member and never have been. i tried this gym last week using a 3 day pass.   i will not be signing up.   this gym is extremely busy. it is very challenging to put in a good workout without waiting for the majority of my workout. i even found myself waiting around just for some extra space to stretch before lifting.  one afternoon there was an entire high school football team working out which i thought odd considering it was the 5pm rush hour.   on a positive note this gym might have the most attractive clientele that i have ever seen. it's on par with the lifetime up near scottsdale and the 101 only this gym's demographics are much younger. if i were 10 years younger i would probably join this gym just to walk around and socialize. maybe get in a few sets in between fist bumps with the fellas. fortunately i am wise enough to know that there are better places than the gym to socialize and better places than la fitness to work out.</text>
<u_review>i am torn between three and four stars on this one. the food is decent but the portions are a little small for these prices. the small portions are somewhat offset by the various side dishes that are included in many of the menu items. i also appreciate how several of the menu items are healthy. the food itself was quite good but thats not saying much because i have never had terrible greek food before. they also have a decent patio which is a plus in my book.</u_review>
<u_review>great atmosphere. the service was adequate despite the throngs of grey haired snowbirds and restless teenagers forced to text and pout while their parents got blitzed on sangria. the queso fundito was very good while the chicken enchiladas had a few "opportunity areas".   my advice for locals....order a $40+ pitcher of some fruity cocktail, sit back, relax and pretend you are on vacation.</u_review>
<u_review>4 stars for terminals 3 and 4, 1 star for terminal 2.  one would think that united airlines would tell sky harbor to update terminal 2 so their passengers don't feel like sardines packed into those tiny gates while waiting for their flight. what a disaster!  i believe it was thomas friedman who said... "asia's new airports look like they belong in the jetsons while sky harbor airport looks like it belongs in the flintstones".</u_review>
<u_review>decent food. great location. friendly service. good booze. simple menu.  attractive patrons. clean bathrooms.   a good place to go if all the other restaurants in the scottsdale quarter are full with a long wait.</u_review>
<b_review>the gym overall is pretty good- just has a couple downfalls. i rarely, almost never see anyone wiping down the equipment- they don't provide you with towels so it's somewhat on an 'honor' system that you utilize the sanitizer/towels that they have in a couple locations in the gym. on multiple instances i've noticed countless people walk away from their gym equipment and not wipe it down- gross.  i've come to the conclusion that i'm going to cancel my membership and work out in my new apartments gym. it's a lot cleaner, and they have all the equipment pieces i need. goodbye la fitness!</b_review>
<b_review>you get what you pay for: lots of posers, muscle heads and average equipement. not enough space for dumb bells and free weights.  parking is a problem, especially at peak times. come early, ohh never mind the staff is always late to open the doors. i can't understand why this club location opens at 5 in the morning during the week but 8am (8am!) on the weekends. i've actually had to wait for staff to show up at 8am on saturday morning. and, then they arrive at 8:15!. give me a break. get some adults to run this location. this is a real pet peeve of mine. hey, note to la fitness.....there are a lot of seniors who live in the 'hood. they are early risers and are ichin' to get in and get out. know your markets, meatheads.  i am amending my review and upgrading this location. i have to say that as far as cleanliness goes, they have two or three people cleaning at all times. it's probably not enough to keep the entire club clean but its a consistent effort. i wouldn't dare to put my rear end on one of the toilets. the equipement is just as bad: i always clean equipement before and after working out.  the pool is clean. oh, hell yea its clean: i think there is a 50 gallon tub of chlorine dropped in it each day. protect yourself and use goggles and a hood or else your hair will turn blue. wash your swimwear immediately. if you swallow some of the pool water, obtain fleet enema right away and get ready to flushhhhh. so, bottom line is that this is a commodity based club. they just want to run as many people through as they can. i don't have any experience with the sales pitches of the trainers but i don't care anyway since i don't use those services. i know they have child care but again, i don't use those services.  it's packed most mornings and evenings and as soon as i find an alternative i'll leave.</b_review>
<b_review>sorely lacks with variety in their cardio. great choice of assisted weight machines. overall nice layout and clean looking but they really should address cardio and spin.</b_review>
<b_review>la fitness just took over pure fitness...yea more locations for me to choose from! well maybe not this one. i went into this location because it is on my way home from work, just to check it out. the people behind the desk were kind of rude. i asked for a tour and they told me to just take a look around. they didn't really want to be bothered with me. is this all the la fitness locations or just this one? i'll check out the location in south scottsdale and see if they are a little nicer.</b_review>

<text>this place is a dump. if you need to get rid of some books, just donate them to goodwill or a veterans group, because you'll get more self satisfaction. i dropped off about 40 books today and they would only offer me $3. $3? are you effing serious? nope, no thank you. i'll drop them off at the va.  if you're looking for older fictional books or records, this place has a pretty serious selection; however, if you're looking for something more present and/or relevant, look somewhere else. hell, if you're looking for a 1990's version study guide for the sat, then this is your place!  this place is so outdated, you can see the dust when you walk in...</text>
<u_review>i had a dr. appointment early in the morning and i had to travel to downtown phoenix. afterwards, it was still pretty early, so i decided to try over easy. i saw this place on diner's, drive-in's and dive's, but i didn't realize i was close by, until i saw it on my yelp app (for android-which isn't as good as the iphone app-booo!). i popped in and had the (i don't remember what it's called), it was the mexican one. it had strips of tortilla's and a sauce with an egg on top. the sauce was really good, but the entire dish was, overall, just average. it was the dish the server recommended, too.   i'll probably stop by again if i'm in the area. this time, i'm having the eggs benedict. person next to me had it, and it looked amazing!</u_review>
<u_review>dude, this place is bomb. another gem found on yelp.  i had the capostromi and the wife had the bobbi. the bobbie tasted like thanksgiving dinner. juicy shredded turkey on a bed of heavenly stuffing and smothered with cranberry sauce. primo, man... primo.  i actually liked the capostromi better. what made the sandwich was the cole slaw topping. really put it together nicely.  my only complaint is, i wish there were more sandwich options.   i'll be going back... and soon!</u_review>
<u_review>go here, before you go to the big chain stores. the tools are half the price are decent in quality. i've had the same tiger saw for six years!</u_review>
<u_review>i've never been to ny, so i can't compare the pizza and i'm a die hard chicago pizza fan, so i am a little biased; however, if this is what ny pizza tastes like, it's better than i thought. the pizza is crazy good and the calzones are even better.</u_review>
<b_review>ok: in the interest of full disclosure; i used to enjoy bookman's about 10-15 years ago. not so much these days.  either demand for stuff has changed or; the 'powers to be' there are clueless. why i say that back in 1998 i took a bunch of slightly ratty auto repair manuals to the ina rd store (tucson) and made something like $50. fast forward to now and i attempted to take some additional shop manuals to the mesa store; they weren't wanted..........even for trade in credit. admittedly interest in fixing up/hotrodding cars is fading but there is still a lot of interest around there.</b_review>
<b_review>i agree that this place has gotten a thrifty store feel to it. i'd much rather go to a library bookstore, or better yet half price books, which is made more for the frugal bibliophile. i've gotten some okay selections here over the years, but it's starting to get a desperate bus stop vibe. the new coffeeshop, though, is a good addition.</b_review>
<b_review>i really like bookmans, especially since they took a lot of my vhs that were just sitting around taking up space. and they gave me a lot of credit for it. i can usually find a book to buy with that credit.   i do wish that their electronics section was a little more expansive... but i know it all depends on what people trade in.    anyways, i'm a fan. glad to support a local bookstore instead of a chain.</b_review>
<b_review>i went to bookmans in the past week to trade in books for store credit. i had two large boxes with about 75 books inside. i also had lots of magazines too. they needed thirty minutes to evaluate my books. i left my books at the counter and briefly walked through the store to see what they had to sell. i returned to the counter and saw my two boxes, which looked as though they had not yet been looked at. an employee soon walked up behind the counter and told me that they could only use two of the books i brought in. i accepted the $9.00 in store credit and hauled my books back to the car. i considered driving to a half price books store to see if they would take more of my books in trade. instead, i drove to the north side of the goodwill store that is next to bookmans. i donated all the items i had at their drive-up donation center. i didn't shop at the goodwill store, but i bet they have a pretty nice selection of books thanks to all the bookmans' trade rejects that ended up there.</b_review>

<text>love this pizza!!!!!!!!!!!!!  omg so good!  the crust is that like thin but crunchy kind, and the red sauce on the pizzas is absolutely perfect. i like their wide array of pizzas and toppings (even though i can't have any pesto pizza because of the nuts in the pesto, boo)  this place, and classic italian in tempe are the best pizza places i've been in to az hands down.</text>
<u_review>so, according to martin's brochure, he does everything and anything having to do with your yard.    cleanups, sprinklers, monthly services, landscape design, etc etc  i called martin after finding his brochure on my door knob.  that's how i choose my landscaper.  my yard was like a jungle.  overgrown grass, weeds, trees, blah! (i've been out of the country a lot the past few months)  martin and a team of workers came over to my place, and for $100 bucks they took care of everything.  and i mean, everything!  they even netted my pool clean!  and they emptied a small trash can i forgot about!    so after being thoroughly satisfied with the work, i hired martin to come out on a bi-monthly basis for $70 per month.    a steal, all things considered, because my yard is big and a painnnnn  hooray!</u_review>
<u_review>eh 18$ for dinner all you can eat  the chinese food was pretty good.  standard greasy chinese.  mmmm.  they have a sushi bar, and the sushi was awful.  i don't even know why i tried it.    so yeah, eh</u_review>
<u_review>raclette!!!!!  ohhhhhhhh sweet sweet raclette, how i love thee.  this place has raclette, and it serves it in the old-school way.  big wheel o' cheese, stuck on some stakes and melting all over meats, potatoes, and cornichons.  awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i tried their savory crepes, i tried the dessert crepes, and i can't wait to come back for some chocolate fondue and more raclette.  and maybe some tartiflette.    holy crap am i happy i discovered this place.  ***they also have the calories listed next to about a dozen entrees, pretty cool!</u_review>
<u_review>came here for the first time, with a large group for a birthday party. uhhhhhh...... delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  we ordered a great variety of appetizers including: lamb stuffed mushrooms chicken shwarma tuna tartare flatbread of the day calamari and seafood wontons  everything i tried, i really liked.    this night, they had two entree specials, including a full maine lobster dinner, and baby back ribs... of a lamb!  i opted for the $27 lobster dinner special, and got my maine lobster grilled- and it came with a cup of clam chowder and fries.  i also ordered a side of the proscuitto mac and cheese.  the lobster was delicious, the sides were delicious, and the mac and cheese was amazingggggggggg. i was really impressed with the price of this entree- because it was pretty great!  for dessert we ordered bread pudding, chocolate pot au creme, chocolate blackberry cake, and peach cobbler.   the desserts were good, but the appetizers and entrees were so great in my mind, they overshadowed the desserts.  all in all, it was a really fantastic meal, and i was shocked at how inexpensive this whole experience was.  great value for the money!  the server was attentive, eddie stopped by and chatted with us for awhile.   i'll be back :)</u_review>
<b_review>not new to florencia, but am still drooling over last night's take-out!  spinach calzone and bobe pesto pizza were so delishus!  hadn't eaten at florencia in a while, and reading the other yelp reviews below that mentioned home-made mozzarella, maybe that was "that something" that just hit the spot so scrumptiously with me.  pizza crust was perfect-- crusty, toothsome,   others sharing the meal also were very happy we went with florencia and not our current usual pizza source that is/was groupon/deal chicken/living social driven.    (wrote i"s/was" because i'll free up pocket change to stick with florencia sans internet deals at other places  because it was just that dang good!!)   would've given a 5, but found the greek salad "ok" and actually laughed at the small amount of marinara dipping sauce that was packed in our takeout bag.</b_review>
<b_review>i did not order pizza from here only the sandwiches.  they were average sandwiches and nothing to rave about.  maybe next time i will try the pizza.</b_review>
<b_review>wish whey were closer to my house. we drive over a half hour at least once a month for the pizza. it's unreal! everytime my father in law comes into town he goes at least three times for pepperoni pizza, well done. he says its the best pizza he has ever had (and he is a self proclaimed pizza connoisseur) you have to try the spinach salad too. the mozzarella and bacon are awesome but the vinaigrette dressing is the best part. please move to gilbert!</b_review>
<b_review>friendly, casual atmosphere with very tasty pizza.  huge variety of toppings and an excellent olive oil base.  i find the pizzas with tomato sauce to be a little bland, but all of the rest have been fantastic.  salads are huge and fresh.</b_review>

<text>i had almost given up on mexican food in phoenix.  i tried this place on a friday during lunch.  i had a combo meal that included a taco and cheese enchilada.  this restaurant is one of my new favorites.  the cheese enchilda was a great choice.  excellent flavor.  the taco was also nice and crispy, and the beef had great flavor.  the chips and salsa were very good.  the salsa was not the best i have ever had, but very good.  i wish they would put the salsa in bowls.  i cant stand eating salsa off of plates.  i will definitely return to this location.  great food and service.</text>
<u_review>this place looked very promising from the menu and the decor.  i typically enjoy any fox restaurant, however, this restaurant is a gimmick.    i ordered the free range half chicken.  i really enjoy this dish at most restaurants, but i was disappointed.  the chicken seemed to be low quality, and was very fatty.  the iced tea was good though.  if you are vegan or have a food allergy, this restaurant will be great for you.  however, otherwise, you are paying for food that may have a gluten-free, vegetarian, or vegan label that lacks flavor.  if you are looking for this option, then try it, but otherwise, i would find a restaurant that offers a smaller selection of these dishes at a lower price.      just mediocre.  and way overpriced.</u_review>
<u_review>i had high hopes for this restaurant.  however, they ended once i was greeted at the door by a very unfriendly hostess.  i had a reservation and had made it over a week in advance.  well, we arrive 10 minutes prior and are seated at a table that was very awkwardly placed, and literally a foot away from what would be another couple.  i asked to be moved, as we wanted more privacy than this, and there were many other open tables.  however, our request was not granted.    so fine, we tried to make the most of it.  however, this was then followed up by a very unfriendly waitress, who went right along with hostess' attitude.  the food was very good, and over priced.   i would say, go if you are getting a good deal on happy hour wine, but stick to wine and skip the food.  maybe a place just for drinks, but even then, the wine list was not all that impressive, and i would recommend going down the street to kazimierz or postino's.</u_review>
<u_review>went for an early dinner around 5:30 last saturday and was really pleased with the experience.  the restaurant has a contemporary feel and plays a good selection of music.  the chicken sandwiches are great, in particular the rosemary chicken sandwich.  thankfully they give you an entire pitcher of water, because their glasses are very small, as they are trying to keep up with the contemporary feel in every respect.  but service was great.  i was a little disappointed with the side salad that comes with the dish, as the dressing was not that appealing.  i didn't like the fact you had to pay $2 extra for fries instead.  however, overall i would return and would recommend this restaurant.</u_review>
<u_review>tried this place out a couple weeks ago on a whim and must have picked the right night to go.  they had a live band that played great music.  the drinks were definitely pricey, but were good.  i wouldn't go here all the time, but it is nice bar that avoids a lot of the scottsdale club scene if you want to get away from that.</u_review>
<b_review>overall, the food is good but truly not mexican in the real sense of the word. it is generally well served but if you do request to hold the cheese in the burrito or omelette,do count of having it included since the chef/cook does not pay attention to the orders given. the coffee is flavored and not the requested regular coffee. the staff truly didn't care about the fact fact that you requested and pay for regular coffee and not hazelnut flavored coffee drinks. i would consider/ think twice before going there again.</b_review>
<b_review>i enjoy going here although it is far from authentic mexican cuisine. you gotta get the mushroom brown sauce it's killer. i enjoy combo number eight with the brown sauce added. stay away from all of the chicken dishes they are bland and dry.</b_review>
<b_review>one of my most favorite places to eat. i've been there no less than a 50 times over the years. love the chips and salsa and everything i've tried has been delish.</b_review>
<b_review>not a bad place.... it is defiantly more tex-mex than authentic... but they have mexican beer, margaritas and is in a good location.</b_review>

<text>stopped in for a happy hour experience and everyone is very friendly from the hostessess to the bartenders. very reasonable drink prices between 4 and 7pm with the highlight being the $3.50 18oz pours of whatever you want (i got some newcastle). hot pretzels are always my favorite and these pretzels were 2 for $5 and served nice and hot and with an unusual roasted pepper cheese sauce that at least for me had a nice kick to it and caused some sweating, but it was an enjoyable sweat. very nice tv setup and they will turn on any game you want. only negative is valet parking. i got there early, but probably better to park somewhere else, instead of heading into the main lot after 6pm.</text>
<u_review>had a really good meal here last night. only took away a star due to not making the mozzarella sticks fresh (i had asked and knew, but ordered anyway) and the fact that the butternut squash ravioli dish had way too much sauce and looked more like soup than pasta. once you sifted through the sauce, the homemade ravioli was quite good. my dish was also ravioli, four cheeses, in a bed of marinara sauce. at least six large clearly homemade ravioli had a nice light filling and a tasty, authentic red sauce. the cream of mushroom soup was great and the salad was fresh and large with good chunky blue cheese dressing on the side. garlic bread and foccaccia was served up hot and a free refill was given. about 15 bucks per dish with the soup or salad included. wanted to try dessert, but who charges 7 bucks for one cannoli. and 8 bucks for a slice of tiramisu?</u_review>
<u_review>too much hassles with parking and why does every mall have those annoying isreali women putting stuff on your hands. also more annoying people trying to get you to donate and adopt some foreign kid and give away your money to who knows what company. food court is too cramped and the stores are your average run of the mill junk with one exception on third floor being the pepper palace. tons of interesting sauces, salsas and powders up there and even a few guys whining after they tried the really hot sauce on display. otherwise, you can find all this stuff without the hassles at any old mall in the area.</u_review>
<u_review>i did return to this place after customer service offered me a giftcard for my 4 star review. the value of the card was $12, so thanks to wildflower for the card. i noticed the sour cream blueberry muffin online, so after i got the card (about 10:30am), i also noticed they were out of that muffin. no big deal right - things sell out, but customer service tells me otherwise:   hi brad,  our standard is to be 100% in stock. i am so sorry to hear we were out of the sour cream blueberry muffins! did you speak with a manager? was this at the tempe location?   the only thing i could think of is that someone came in and ordered a very large unexpected order for a catering however that would be a guess and it is always best to go straight to the source!   i did receive an apology, but never got an explanation about why they were out of that muffin, despite this policy. anyway, the pumpkin/chocolate muffin was outstanding, but if that really is your policy, then get it right!. i'm not sure whether these things are baked in-store or at a central facility, but that may have been a factor.    tried the scones, but they are not great. blueberry muffin better.</u_review>
<u_review>just attended the taco bash. got there two hours after opening and it was already crowded. most tents had hardly any room in them to just hang out, but you could find your niche if you tried hard enough. there were lines for most things, but it wasn't a long wait for anything and that included id check, tickets and getting a beer. some taco places did have rather long lines, but you could also find many that did not have those lines. they had wrestling and some lame bands, but the crowd was mellow and friendly as we met some new friends in the drinking/tent zones. as for tacos, i had one bad one from manuel's and two good chicken ones from familiar places in the valley, like salty senorita. half-priced admission tickets helped the cause as all drinks were 6 bucks each, but true to their word, all tacos were 2 bucks. people were still streaming in at 4pm, so crowds are the only real issue, but today it wasn't scorching hot and you could find room to be away from crowds too if you wanted. pretty good festival.</u_review>
<b_review>tater tots and pretzel bun burgers. yum. this place has yet to disappoint. parking is tricky even with valet but it always works out.</b_review>
<b_review>i really enjoy the atmosphere at this bar & grill. definitely the place to go if you're in the arcadia neighborhood.</b_review>
<b_review>great place to watch a game, relax and have fun with the staff as they attend to my food and beverage needs. will definitely be heading over more!</b_review>
<b_review>was lucky enough to come here to grab a late lunch with my husband yesterday. the food was great - a good variety of bar food, and it may seem silly, but i was very excited to have the option of tater tots as my side. my wrap was delicious, and my husband had a sandwich on a pretzel roll that looked and tasted fantastic.   this definitely looks like a great place for a group of friends to come and have a good meal to watch the game. the booths were large and comfy. i can't wait to try more from their menu!</b_review>

<text>the clarendon is a hotel with a real level of charm to it.  i've been to a lot of hotels and most of them, most of the higher-end hotels that cater to a lot of business travelers are so dull and lifeless that it's almost extraordinary that you could deliberately suck all of the life out of your hotel's decor.  this hotel does have some genuine life to it and it's the small things that make the difference, like playing music underwater in the pool.  better yet, playing awesome music underwater in the pool like the cramps.  i've always liked staying at hotels in my own city.  it's fun not being home, it's like having a sleepover as an adult without having to crash on someone's couch and wake up the next morning with a fucked up back and shoulder.  gallo blanco is a big reason to enjoy coming to the clarendon.  they make a mean michelada.  throwing dill in there is a great idea, it adds a pickly taste and a bite that just takes the drink to another level.  i guess my only real complaint is that it's a bit overpriced.  i booked the room for 80-some bucks which is, you know, whatever.  that's usually kind of the standard rate for a hotel room in the mid-range, plus it came with a high-def flatscreen tv (no hbo, though).  a lot of high class hotels continue to have shitty tv's in the room and it boggles my mind.  still, when we checked in, there was then a $15 per-night fee that included two bottles of water in the room and snacks at the front desk, which is like... man, couldn't you build that into my hotel room price initially?  so with that and a lodging fee (not including tax) it ended up being over $100.  not nearly as good a price i thought it was going to be when i first booked the room.  this is still a really fun hotel and a place i'd recommend people to stay if they're coming in from out of town.</text>
<u_review>this is a great place to knock back pitchers.  if you can get yourself a table at bikini, you've got it made, buddy.    i like the diverse crowd of hipsters, grizzled old dudes, tough guys and the occasional homeless guy who comes in with a pillow, asking you where they have blankets.  that's a true story.  and then he started singing along to a michael jackson song, but didn't form any words whatsoever.  he sort of looked like n!xau from "the god's must be crazy."  i'm gonna miss that guy.  in the restroom, one of those miniature xxx things tumbled out of the vending machine.  a gift from god!  or, so i thought.  free half-inch in diameter porn!  the instructions told me to rub the chick's binki until it went away, but that didn't work.  i tried using a quarter like it was a scratch-off or something, but i just ended up mutilating it.  it was macabre.  in a weird way, i felt like lenny from of mice and men.  i tried to be gentle, but i accidentally killed her.  this place is great.  i always have a very, very good time.</u_review>
<u_review>viewing this place from the outside, it sort of reminds me of a restaurant you might see at an egyptian-themed theme park or water park or something.  it's pretty cheesy.  it reminds me of the set design in the movie cleopatra with richard burton and liz taylor.  the food was overall pretty okay.  i went with a group of co-workers and what i got was just okay, but i grabbed a piece of something that someone else was eating and it was pretty fantastic, so, like anywhere, it depends on what you order.  the portions you get are quite large.  i'm cursed with an insatiable appetite and they sated my hunger.</u_review>
<u_review>i'm with jason c. on this one.  given the price for the cheeseburger i bought, i was a little "meh," about it.  it did taste pretty good; it was pretty bomb but it i've had cheaper and better.  the fries, yeah, are pretty damn good too.    the decor is alright.  the line to get your food and the actual dining area is divided by sacks of potatoes.  yes, it's tacky but i thought that was cool.  oh, and free peanuts.  if you ride a bike, do not use the bike rack right out in front.  don't do it.  you see all that bird shit everywhere?  if you, for one minute, assume that you're not gonna get shit on, you are incorrect.  i was lazy so i chanced it.  unlocking my bike to go home, bull's eye.  i got poop right on my eyebrow.  gross.  this is a decent place.  it's worth trying out if you're in the area of if you're curious.  three stars, i like it but i'm not crazy about it.</u_review>
<u_review>narcisse is a funny place because it advertises that being narcissistic is a good thing.  the decor has these decorative, novelty mirrors on the walls because narcissus, blah blah blah.  thing is, i don't think they're being ironic or making any sort of comment on society being so shallow, i think it's legitimately like a very "greed is good" kind of admission of character.  it's not satire.  it's scottsdale.  the color scheme is purple.  purple, purple everywhere.  as such, i felt like i was in that one scene in batman (1989) where the joker poisons everyone and kim bassinger has to put on that red gas mask.  i've spent a lot of time describing what the place looks like, much more than i typically do, but i feel like it is an important part of the overall experience of coming here.  look, for $10, you get bottomless "bubbles," which... i thought was adorable that they kept saying "bubbles!" but it turns out that at these kinds of places, everyone thinks they're a champagne expert, which is kind of funny because it's $10, so if they don't say bubbles or something adorable, people will get pissed.  if you wanted to have classy sparkling wine, $10 would be the smartest use of money since steve jobs invested in pixar.  there's no need to complain unless you think that your snob muscle is getting flabby.    everything else is reasonably priced, too.  my breakfast burrito was pretty damn big and cost something like $9.  don't get me wrong.  it was bland.  it certainly wasn't bad, but it was like a rough approximation of a breakfast burrito and executed without all the love.  i wouldn't recommend coming here unless your mission, really, is to have a group of people get kind of sauced in the morning and have some laughs, plug your gut with some food and probably pass out a couple hours later by a pool.</u_review>
<b_review>for a hip hotel with nice rooms, great food, and a funky heated pool, this place was a disaster.   i stayed here one night (sunday) for a business trip and left the following afternoon around 5.  the first problem, a small one, was the lack of room service. i was tired and busy working and just wanted a burger in my room. unfortunately they don't have room service, so i headed down to the restaurant for a quick bite.   that shouldn't have been a problem since the restaurant downstairs is ranked as one of the best in phoenix. and the food was good. but the service was surly and unwelcoming. they are trying to pull off a hipster, trendy vibe at that place, but since when did trendy become synonymous with rude? waiters would barely look at you, throw you a menu, and shrug with ambivalence if you asked a question about the menu. i ate as fast as i could and got the hell out of there. (and by the way, i'm not a crotchety old man complaining about manners - i'm 31 and pretty darn laid back).  the next morning i ask for a cab to the office where i'm having my meeting so they call one for me. 10, 15, 20 minutes go by. finally, as i start to call my own cab because i'm going to be late it finally shows. more on that in a bit.  i returned after my meeting and checked out around 11 but didn't have a flight out for six hours and needed to work, so they graciously held my bags and let me hang around. too bad there was nowhere else in the hotel to work except the too cool for school restaurant. but i took my chances and ordered a coffee and took a seat as far in the corner as possible so my suit and tie corporateness and laptop neediness didn't kill the vibe.  apparently it didn't work. the manager walked by every five minutes disdainfully asking if i needed anything else or was ready for the check. alright, message received. the situation was so uncomfortable i grabbed my bags and left the hotel in search of somewhere else to ply away the afternoon.  but of course this hotel is also in the middle of nowhere, a barren wasteland of vacant parking lots and run down apartment complexes. i walked a four block radius and found a chinese buffet and a safeway. not really conducive to work.  reluctantly i went back to the hotel (where again they graciously took my bags) and i went to work in the lobby out of the way. awkward but effective. finished my work and decided to head straight to the airport three hours early because by this point an overpriced airport bar was more welcoming than this place.  good thing i wasn't in a hurry. they called me a cab and i waited 45 minutes - four five - for the cab. no cab. never came. finally, after waiting huddled in the lobby with my bags for nearly an hour i told them to cancel my taxi and called my own after spending two seconds on yelp (yay yelp!). the taxi i called came in five minutes, and i was able mercifully to close the book on the clarendon.  two stars because they provided the most basic hotel service - clean, comfortable place to sleep - and because the food really was terrific. but for the price and hassle, i'm really disappointed in this place.  also, fyi, the situation bothered me enough to create a yelp account and write my first review.</b_review>
<b_review>very lovely boutique hotel! i really enjoyed staying here and would not hesitate to do it again in the future. the staff was friendly (especially the lovely lady who blessed us with free guacamole from the restaurant during the free snack time after 10pm which includes everything chocolate, chips, sodas and more), our room, which was considered a jr. suite, was incredibly roomy and decorated in a very modern 70's decor just like the rest of the place. bright colors, very specific detailing, including bathroom products from philosophy and aveda, great choices of flavorful coffee pods for the keurig coffee maker with flavored creamer, lamps from ikea and incredible arizona location photography on the walls. i was also intrigued by the use of blue glass throughout, including the asphalt in the parking area!!!...i'm a sucker for detail!  another plus of the clarendon is their beautifully thought out pool redo from a very obvious apartment complex pool throw back! they were able to implement an incredible  wall of water and split what was a boring oblong pool into one amazing jacuzzi area. and when you're tired of that you can hike up 5 flights of stairs to their rooftop seating/bar area for an amazing view of the city lights.  i really did enjoy this place. only downside is the thin walls and old school windows which let in a lot of noise and cold air (it's cold in phoenix in the winter). other than that, i can't wait to come back.</b_review>
<b_review>this is a cute boutique hotel - i stayed in one of the executive rooms for four nights - roomy with an awesome king size bed and 42" flat screen tv. friendly staff to boot, too.  the pool area is amazing - unfortunately, i could only admire it from afar as it was too chilly to take a dip (there is a jacuzzi that they claim holds 50 people that i didn't take advantage of  - didn't bring the swim trunks).  the only issue i had was the location of the hotel - having stayed near tempe & scottsdale on my last visit, being in downtown phoenix was a drag. it didn't feel like a real downtown to me and there was lots of street construction going on for their transit system. on the plus side it is near some of the gay bars (if that counts for anything).</b_review>
<b_review>my husband and i stayed on a monday night just as a 'stay-cation' and it was busier than i had expected. huge bed and very comfy. the ac buzzed  off and on all night and we didn't have the bathrobes that were advertized online. but the rooftop deck had a nice view and the breeze was welcomed. we got a drink from the bar and took it up to the roof with us. the pool looked very inviting but there were too many kids splashing around for us to want to venture in. overall it was a good experience and not bad for the discount rate that we found. we were definitely impressed by the huge bed.</b_review>

<text>i had lunch here again the other day and i realize i was either very high or absolutely starving last time i ate here. this visit i pretty much had the opposite experience. the food was horrible. the salsa had chunks of tomatoes as big as my fist, the burrito was dry and bland. they sat us in a room under a tv and it was so loud we could barely talk. i'll have to go back though... at least give them one more shot..</text>
<u_review>mexican flan in a japanese bakery? you bet your sweet little tooth! delicious. cannot wait to go back and get the green tea mousse.</u_review>
<u_review>baiz market is a wonderful ethnic experience. i went in for lunch to satisfy my curiosity and was very impressed. the market portion of the store is huge, the produce area was well stocked as were their meats (you can buy an entire goat). i wandered through the isles for quite a while taking in all the exotic spices, they had not only middle eastern, but also african and asian items. there was tons of tikka sauces, red pepper pastes, hummus and baba spreads. the bakery was awesome containing date and fig breads, 50 cent pita packs and little meat pies. they also carried hookahs, tons of shisha and every accessory you can think of to go with them.   after my shopping was finished i stopped at al hana, the little restaurant inside and had the beef schwarma (as recommended in several reviews). i am hoping it was just an off day, because the schwarma was very dry and grizzly and the pita it was served with was hard. i also ordered the baba ganoush and it was pretty tasty. i washed this down with a rose water (actually tastes just like it sounds but super sweet). all in all this was a great experience and i will definitely be back.</u_review>
<u_review>i was pretty impressed with this place. their customer service was excellent. they greeted me and my girlfriend right away and put us in chairs with hot suds and gave us ice cold water while we waited for them to finish the people before us. they hand you a price sheet, which is really nice when they don't speak english, you pick your service and there are no surprises at the end. we both got mani-pedis, for $28 bucks, pretty good price. the best part was they didn't hurt me! i hate when you get a ped and they attack your cuticles or try to slough off your alive skin cells from your feet. i would recommend this place to anyone. they don't have the best selection of colors though so if you want something special bring your own.</u_review>
<u_review>bravo timo! well done.   i loved bomberos and timo has moved in to the beautiful spot and went easy on the remodeling.. if it ain't broke don't fix it! the patio was left intact and is gorgeous. i would recommend this for groups or for a romantic dinner for two. when it is cold the fire pit is awesome and it is quaint and charming.   the inside is cozy and well designed, i usually opt to sit at the bar so i can watch them prepare my food and slide it in to the wood fired oven.  i went for brunch last week and it was awesome (see pics).  i had the benedict with avocado, tomato, black truffle, prosciutto and hollandaise  and it was simply divine!  i could not leave without trying the grapefruit brulee, equally scrumptious.  i can't wait to go back for dinner. they have a bottle of wine and a flatbread for $20 on mondays!</u_review>
<b_review>my bf and i just ate here. we are staying down the road and wanted a good authentic mexican meal. phoenix is full of mexican restaurants and its hard to choose but let me tell you this is one to avoid. it was gross. i had 2 tacos one enchilada. the carne esada taco was ok but everything else was salty and soggy.  we were the only people in the place but it was an odd hour at 3p . i will not be back.</b_review>
<b_review>it seems like something has changed  food .8 of 2 cleanliness .8 of 1 service .8 of 1 decor 1 of 1  la canasta is a place we stop occasionally when one of us comes home by plane. i understand this particular la canasta seasoned with lots of hard work and dedication, launched a food empire. parts of that empire have gotten good reviews in the past. i remember the food here as being good.  a link to my complete yahoo! local review and photos is below:  http://local.yahoo.com/info-19966132-sylvia-s-la-canasta-mexican-restaurant-phoenix?tab=reviews#reviews</b_review>
<b_review>if you come here expecting good service, in the exact same fashion i'd laugh at a crappy comedian. the service is awful, they forget minor things all the time and give seemingly smart ass answers when you have questions.  me: "what's fritanga?" her: "it's an omelette." me: "i know it's a %$#@in' omelette as it says fritanga omelette. but what is fritanga!?"  or:  me: "can i get lime instead of lemon?" her: "it comes with it." me: "it says lemon comes with it. i am asking for lime."  i think it might have to do more with comprehension than anything else. i hope they don't spit in my food.  however, the food is great. i am giving it 3 stars due to horrible service. at least it's not really slow. their beans are consistently delicious, and their red chile is the best in town. i also really enjoy their chile relleno, but their salsas could use some work.  go to the one on 7th ave and grant. it's much better for some reason.</b_review>
<b_review>not good...tables were not clean, waiter was scattered and they charged me $6.00 for a margarita that was worth $2.00.  i have driven past it numerous times and the outside makes you want to go in - but looks are not always as they seem.  save your time and money - there are to many mexican restaurants in phoenix that are better.  we wont be back.  on a good note - the food was pretty good.  but, there is something wrong with the energy of this place.</b_review>

<text>ack. i don't know why my brain tells me every once in a while that this place is a good idea.  after spending nearly $30 on my husband, toddler and i, i get irritated that basically a soup and salad buffet is way too expensive.  though they have a good variety of soups, and salads, i can't justify the price.  other items that are available are slices of pizza, sweet potato and baked potatoes, 3 pasta selections hiding in the corner and appear to have been sitting there under the heat lamp for days.  they really need to either cook smaller portions or replenish them every so often instead of leaving it in there to crust up.  they also have muffins and a dessert bar.  again, i don't know why out of all the selections in desert ridge made me chose this place. i'm pretty sure i told myself that i'd never eat here again the last time i was here. so i say it again....i will not eat here again.</text>
<u_review>never ever again clever koi. never. ambiance was very hipster with loud music.  that's fine.  service? meh.  the hubs and i took my parents here for dinner to celebrate my mothers health.  we waited about 25 minutes for our table - even though there were other tables sitting empty.    my mom and i ordered the seafood hot pot. okay when you think hot pot, you think of those pots where you throw in a bunch of veggies, seafood, meat, what have you - never did i think that it meant it was spicy hot.  we had started off with our unimpressive appeitzer of the catfish/scallop/shrimp dumplings with "nuoc cham" which is basically fish sauce.  the four dumplings were about the size of a quarter and sat inside a huge bowl filled with fish sauce.  for $8, i'd say that's a hefty rip off.  we all literally leaned in towards the table to look inside the giant bowl at our dumplings.  next up we ordered the wood grilled octopus/sea weed/xo aioli sauce - blah.  all bun, no octopus.  we also tried the peking duck/house bacon/mizuna/charred plum jam - that was just meh.  ugh so disappointing, at yet another $4/bun.    my mom's spicy seafood udon bowl came out - it was too spicy so she gave it to my dad.  and he ate it.  said it was decent.  we sat there and watched him eat.....eat.....eat....eat....and then he was done.....and we sat there and looked at his empty bowl as our bowls had still yet to come out.  i don't get it, we ordered 2 of the same bowls - at least the 2nd one should have come out?  the hostess came to clear my dads bowl - i told her we still hadn't gotten ours yet, she kinda apologized and walked off.  about 15 minutes later, the 2nd udon bowl came out and one of the pork ramen bowls came out.  so i told my mom and hubs to eat.  as i sat there and watched them eat.....and eat.....and eat.  towards their last few bites, my pork ramen bowl came out - the server, or maybe it was the manager came out to deliver it to me and apologized for the delay of the entire meal and said this bowl was on the house.  that was a nice gesture - but considering the circumstances, all our bowls should have been comp'd.  my mom and i couldn't finish our pork bowls - it was so extremely salty - the "broth" was so dark it tasted and looked like it was sitting in a bowl of soy sauce.    after my 1 comp'd ramen bowl, our bill still came out to over $80.  i'm all for fusion food - but this was just ridiculous.</u_review>
<u_review>this is a happenin' place! i often feel rushed when i get in line to order because they have a person carrying a notepad or something taking our order as we stand in line, so i don't really get to peruse the menu to see what i want - an option is to get out of line to read the menu, but considering how busy it is, you need to stand in line, get your order and hope to get a table to sit at.  i'm not a huge hot dog fan, so i usually just order the "hot dog". it comes with everything including: mustard, relish, freshly chopped onions, sliced red ripe tomatoes, kosher pickle and sport peppers piled onto a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun.  the best part is the poppy seed bun. so soft and warm!  they also have crinkle fries that are also really good.  i'd definitely keep coming back to this place as there are many other things on the menu that i want to try.</u_review>
<u_review>it was our first time so i asked the blonde at the counter what was good.  she said she didn't know since she doesn't eat the food. um. ok.    i ended up ordering the miso ramen, which a huge mistake.  it was so salty and just had a really weird taste to it.  i couldn't even finish it.  the husband tried the tonkotsu ramen with beef which he enjoyed. our friend came late and ordered the same thing but the blonde said, "we're out of beef."  so then my friend said, "is the chicken or charsiu better then?"  her answer, "that's all we have...is chicken or charsiu left."  um. ok.   though my food experience was not the best, my husband enjoyed his, and i'd like to  come back if we're ever on that side of town again to try the tonkotsu or the udon.  i'm willing to give it another try.  but they need a better hostess at the front because she was absolutely clueless.</u_review>
<u_review>this place was pretty good.    it was a weekday so the place was pretty dead.  our server was pretty attentive and extremely knowledgeable of the menu.  he recommended stuff to us that ended up ordering and were happy with.  we ordered the six shooters (tortilla crusted hand stuffed cheddar, bacon filled jalapeno shots with a cilantro buttermilk sauce) - it was too spicy for me, but the other 3 enjoyed them.  we also ordered the nachos (large corn tortilla rounds with drunken black beans, pulled pork, serrano chile, fire roasted tomato and tomatillo salsa, and a blend of cheddar, manchego, monterrey jack cheese and mexican crema cheeses.)  pretty darn amazing.    the hubs ordered the fish tacos which were pretty tasty and filled him up.  i ordered the fajitas, which was nothing special and could be eaten at any other restaurant that served fajitas.  my brother ordered the pan roasted pork tenderloins which were cooked perfectly medium-rare and was probably the best dish out of all of ours.  my sil ordered the enchilada - and quite honestly, i don't remember if she liked it or not.  in the end, we decided to try to cuban corn - which was by far, the best!  i could have eaten more if there was any left.    for the 4 of us, it was almost $180 (including tip).  a bit pricey, but i would go back - even if it was just for the corn on the cob...and the great service.</u_review>
<b_review>the variety of food wasn't the best... but you still go in hungry and leave stuffed!  towards the end of our meal we were offered freshly baked chocolate chip cookies :).  i'm a salad fan so i'm sure i'll be mozying back here at some point.</b_review>
<b_review>i went here expecting another sweet tomatoes in the 'usual' layout that i'm familiar with all the other sweet tomatoes i've been to in the valley.   what surprised me was the completely different layout and atmosphere of the place. there was the industrial/warehouse/loft vibe to the place that i really enjoyed.   there was the usual two-sided salad bar when you walked in. but once you paid you entered a large dining room with high metal ceilings and lots of wood. high backed booths along the walls gave a sense of privacy while you ate.   the beverage, soup, and dessert bars were all parallel with each other in a corner of the dining room and the bread and pasta bars were perpendicular to those.   very airy and open dining area.   the food was good as always. love mondays because it's cream of mushroom soup night.....that's the reason i went. love their cream of mushroom soup.(what can i say?) also had a pork posole that was pretty darn impressive.   this month (april '09) they are highlighting lemon-flavored items. had a pretty tasty summer lemon salad and some lemon muffins (better than they sound.)   and their frozen yogurt is always a treat to top off the meal.   if you're hungry....and not quite sure what you want....check out sweet tomatoes. they have plenty of options available and you should find something to interest your taste buds.   and one more thing. they are touting some new 'green' initiatives such as using recycled paper napkins, newer lighting, and going with 'tankless' hot water heaters....all in the name of the environment.   anytime a business at least makes an effort to help the environment i'm impressed.</b_review>
<b_review>as sweet tomato's go, this one is like all of the rest with one exception.  the food is great like all of the other sweet tomato's.  the food is fresh like all of the other sweet tomato's.  the food is healthy like all of the other sweet tomato's.  but this sweet tomato's is special because they have great service!  i've been there several times when it was packed to the gills and the staff never lost a step.  they kept the food coming and they looked genuinely happy that you were there.  they always treat us like we are the only people in the whole place.</b_review>

<text>to quickly summarize my feelings of our experience at ruth chris's: thank goodness we had a giftcard that paid for part of our meal! if we had paid full price, my husband and i would have felt more ripped off than we did when we left.  now, we don't mind dropping $145 for a dinner if the food is really good and the atmosphere is amazing. sadly, neither was true at ruth's chris steakhouse.  my husband had the petit filet and shrimp combo for dinner. while he said the shrimp were very good, he said the steak was just ok. definitely not the most amazing steak he has ever ate.  i had the crab cake entree, which was three lump crab cakes. was it worth the almost $30 pricetag? heck no! i appreciated that there was really no filling and it was lump crab meat, it was way way too moist for me.  i don't like my crabcakes bone dry, but i don't like them overly moist. mccormick and schmick's are way too dry, but ruth chris's are way too moist. blah. also, there was too much horseradish or something like along those lines for my taste.  i can't wait to visit my parents in maryland this summer to actually get some good crabcakes.  our mashed potato side that we ordered was large enough for the two of us, but the potatos were meh.  the $1 instant potatoes we buy at fry's are better and have more flavor.  for dessert, we had the cheesecake. i'm sorry to say that the cheesecake at the cheesecake factory is 10x better than what i ate at ruth chris's.  our waiter was very nice...attentive but not overbearing or pushy. the atmosphere was just ok.  we had reservations, but still had to wait almost 20 minutes to be seated...wtf? and for an "upscale" restaurant, i was shocked to see people roll in with jeans and sweatshirts on! yuck.  my husband and i said that it is highly unlikely we will ever go back to ruth's chris steakhouse.  high prices do not equal good food.</text>
<u_review>i have been to the parlor twice now for dinner - the first time was on a thursday night with a group of eight and the second time was with a friend this past saturday night. this past saturday night, the restaurant and bar area were packed - luckily my friend and i were able to grab two seats at the bar which is where we dined rather than face a 40 minute wait for a table either inside or outside. the feel of the parlor is modern but inviting. i love the exposed brick in the bar area.  the pesto pizza (minus the tomatoes) is delicious - it's big enough to share if you want, but not so big that if you ate it yourself you would feel like a pig. the caesar salad is a nice size and would suffice as a meal if you wanted to. the pesto chiatarra pasta is really good. it's the perfect portion size (it also comes with a piece of toasted bread that is great to soak up pesto after you are done with the pasta) and is really flavorful. the tiramisu is the best i have ever tried - it was so light tasting and i would have ate the whole thing if my friend had let me! a single scoop of gelato (i tried the chocolate) is a perfect light dessert.  not only is the food delicious, but it's perfectly portioned and very reasonably priced. you won't break the bank dining here. on my first trip, my bill came to $20 (after tax and tip) for a salad, beer, and half a 12" pizza. on saturday night, our bill came to $33 before tip (2 entrees and 2 desserts). our drinks were paid for by a nice gentleman in the bar area who felt bad about intruding our space when going up to order drinks. if we had paid for our beers, they would have ranged in price from $3.50 to $5. the draft selection is much better than most restaurants and even some bars!  i definitely recommend this place and hope to be back in the near future.</u_review>
<u_review>i was a workout class virgin until i took the class at karve on tuesday evening. while it didn't make me a convert to studio classes, it was a very intense, challenging, and different kind of workout for me. the studio is located along the waterfront and is right across from canal. the entire staff i interacted with last night from the girl at the front desk to our instructor kendra to the class helpers were all very nice and helpful. the website is really good and you can even schedule classes online which is a great feature.  the karve class combines ballet barre work, yoga, pilates and free weights to work your entire body...last night i discovered muscles i didn't even know i had! even though i work out 4-5 times a week (weights and cardio), i still had to take a few second break once or twice during the one hour class because of the intensity and the fact it was a completely new way of working out for me. breaks are encouraged if you need them and i saw others in the class stop for a few seconds when it got to be too much for them. i really liked the  fact there are class helpers and was not insulted at all when they came over to me once or twice (ok maybe more like five or six times) to correct what i was doing. i am glad they fixed it so i would be working the muscle or area i should have been. i did learn last night that if your legs start shaking uncontrollably, that's a good thing!   i agree with amber that i would have liked if the instructor had demonstrated all the moves because i am very much a visual learner. overall, karve was a great workout and i am definitely feeling it this morning! i plan to go back and take classes occasionally to mix my workout up.</u_review>
<u_review>this is a solid four star establishment if you are coming for the beer selection and atmosphere. i have to minus 1/2 star for confusing service...we had three different people wait on us and at one point the one waitress forgot that we had placed an order with her (luckily she had rang it in, but still). i also have to minus 1/2 star for the food that we ordered. we had the chicken quesadillas and bruschetta. the chicken quesadillas were good in the fact that they had a lot of chicken meat, which was tasty. other than that, they were incredibly blah. there was barely any cheese on them and some green chiles. the plate didn't even have lettuce or tomatoes on it. the bruschetta was not spectacular at all...in fact it had way too much garlic on it which overpowered everything else.  onto the good stuff...great beer selection! there are tons of beers on tap from a nice variety of breweries, but the main attraction seems to be the enormous selection of bottled beer. you can pick one out to drink there or you can take it to go. we didn't try any of the bottled beers this time, but next time we definitely plan to. since i was driving, i was boring and just had an 8th street ale. my husband tried two different beers, but unfortunately i don't remember the names. one was a stout that he enjoyed very much...it was really smooth and had a really nice creamy aftertaste. the other beer he tried was an irish ale, but it was not very enjoyable at all, which disappointed us.  prices were incredibly moderate and for three beers and the two appetizers, our bill without tip was $29.  there is nothing flashy about papago brewing co...it's in a strip mall like everything else seems to be in arizona and the sign on the front is pretty small, so you may drive by it while looking for it like i did. the inside is wood and dimly lit with a large tv screen and two smaller tvs (thankfully they had basketball on!). the jukebox has a very large selection (bonus points for having dropkick murphys) and has a great mix of the cheesy songs you love to sing along to, as well as current artists and songs.  there is also a selection of board games that you can play while drinking and hanging out, which is a nice touch.</u_review>
<u_review>i was made aware of mickey's hangover in scottsdale when i first moved out here because my husband and i are both ohio state alums, and mickey's is the bar to watch ohio state games on saturdays.  it's almost like being in columbus, but with blue skies and warm weather.  the waitstaff is very pleasant during the games, but not extremely fast or attentive. the food is just ok and pretty greasy.  i do enjoy the onion rings, as it compliments my $8 buckets of bud light very well.  i 100% do not recommend the sampler platter...we made the mistake of ordering it the first tiime we went to mickey's. i do believe they have the grossiest mozzarella sticks this side of the mississippi river. sorry, but i don't want my mozzarella sticks to come shaped like an eggroll.  and i don't think i've seen anyone drink pbr since my days at ohio state, but it flows aplenty at mickey's.  the decor is laid back with comfy couches up front. the catch during ohio state games we learned is that you have to reserve the couches. seriously that is lame.  our experience at mickey's during the ohio state/michigan game completely turned us off to the establishment and i am not really sure we will be returning in the future.</u_review>
<b_review>date with mom at ruth's chris for mother's day!  this is our first visit to this ruth's location. reservation at 6:15pm and the place was about 80% filled when we arrived(not the patio). wow, must be good! i had the ruth's classic dinner (house salad, 6 oz filet and shrimp with a side of mashed potatoes; chocolate cake with fresh berries for dessert), and for $39.95! definitely worth it! mom just wanted the 8oz petite filet. the meat was really juicy, tender and flavorful, you really get what you paid for. the manager tim came to check on us a few times which we thought it was really nice.  the dessert gave us a very sweet and pleasant ending. can't wait for another visit!</b_review>
<b_review>dining at ruth's chris is always a treat.. i have dined at this local, las vegas, nv for my wedding reception in march 2008, and also for a lunch as well as the san diego harbor location for a new years eve dinner..  if you don't like top quality meats or haven't had them, i defy anyone to find a better steakhouse.. you are paying for the steaks which are served on their signature 500 degree plates with sizzling butter.. i always go for the nyer, a side of creamed spinach..   i have never had a bad service or had to complain about my food. trust me, i will make my displeasure known, professionally and courteously. you always get more flies with honey than vinegar.   the food at ruth's chris is top notch. sorry to hear about the other reviewers birthday problem. a call to the location and a talk with the general manager would have done wonders the next day..</b_review>
<b_review>great service, tasty steak. highly recommend the filet or the filet with shrimp. the sides are huge portions, so keep that in mind when ordering. my dad ordered the lobster and it wasn't the best...but it is a steakhouse... there desserts are all amazing. i recommend the banana cream pie, creme brulee, or bread pudding.</b_review>
<b_review>last night 11/9/10, 6 of us went to what used to be a top rated happy hour here.  let me tell you, cross it off your list! they've changed the appetizers, raised the prices and service was non existant now that their business has picked up!  we could not get waited on on the patio and actually went in twice to find our server, who announced she was really busy inside and didn't even attempt to apologize.  we ended up leaving after over and hour and a half and went to another restaurant.  cross this place off your happy hour list-they no longer want our business!</b_review>

<text>enjoyed my veggie burger with fries. service sucked the last 2 times. we had to flag down a waitress to get our refills. next time we'll do take out to avoid tipping poor service</text>
<u_review>absolutely loved this restaurant. your immediately greeted when you walk in, the service is friendly, the food is delicious and the price is just right.  i ordered the pizza rustica, their version of the vegetarian. it tasted as good as it looked. the caramelized onions along with the mushrooms , goat cheese and mushrooms all on a thin crust, just melt in your mouth. my love order the calzone. a little odd since it literally was just pizza folded over with sauce on the side and not what you would think a calzone would be. but nonetheless, he finished his entire meal, as did i. i highly recommend this place. i am a pizza lover who has tried a lot of pizza spots in arizona and trust me when i tell you, you will not be disappointed. we are definitely coming back to this one.</u_review>
<u_review>pizza is inconsistent. sometimes under cooked, other times cut disturbingly wrong ( sad when half of it is for a vegetarian ). forget ordering chicken wings! it's like pulling teeth!!!! how hard is it to get " medium bone out "? 4 out of 5 times it's anything but! last night was the straw that broke camels back when we found out that this time they gave us honey bbq. after calling the manager to let her know of the mistake, she replies "i guess some one else got your wings". really!? an apology would have been more appreciated then a sarcastic comment! i don't recommend going to this pizza hut. the service is worse then the neighborhood it sits in. i wish there was a negative star i could rate this place.</u_review>
<u_review>the helpful female behind the counter casually taking my double whopper meal order just a few mins before closing with a  friendly smile on her face was enough to forget your in a sketchy area late at night. i very much enjoy my endless options at the soda machine and the clean tables in the dining area.</u_review>
<u_review>far from authentic but fish taco tuesdays is money well spent. especially since their only $1.25. i usually get about 4 fish taco's on flour tortilla's with extra onions. i pour on their delicious hot salsa from the 4 option salsa bar and go to town. i have tasted their specialty shrimp burrito's and if it wasn't for the price, i would order it more often. for now, my wallet thanks me.</u_review>
<b_review>fez is a chic` restaurant where all the cool kids go. whether you are there for lunch, dinner or drinks it has an easy atmosphere with mid range pricing. i consider this to be a very eclectic menu so if you are sick of the same-old food, try out fez</b_review>
<b_review>the first time i went to fez was a couple of years back during the horrific light rail construction period.  my friends and i literally had to park a couple of blocks away because there was no way to get to the restaurant parking lot.  despite the hassle, we were quite surprised by what we discovered.  fez wasn't the usual happy hour.  fez is probably the first place i've been to in downtown phoenix that has the look and feel of a restaurant/bar i would expect to find in downtown scottsdale (without the scottsdale attitude of course).  everytime i've been, my friends and i always grab a seat on the couch and munch on some appetizers while enjoying a beer.  their bruchetta appetizer is perfect for a small group.  what i found most pleasantly surprising was their burgers.  the fez and bleu cheese burgers are two of the better burgers i've had.  they use some outstanding flavor combos to make those burgers wicked tasty.  i haven't had the sweet potato fries but most regulars there will tell you its a can't miss.  as for the drinks, they've got a pretty good beer selection and their wine menu is pretty decent.  one of my gal pals loves their martinis.  all in all, a nice addition to downtown.  now that the light rail construction is done and the trains will be moving soon, fez will probably see business boom.  i only have a few qualms.  sometimes its a little too crowded (usually the first few hours after work) and some of the entrees are a little overpriced.  still there's plenty of good times where you won't deal with the overflow and theres plenty of cheap items on the menu (particularly during happy hour).  hopefully fez doesn't lose its charm as more folks stream into this place.  bottomline, if you're in the downtown area, this is a place you have to try.</b_review>
<b_review>oh fez!  what country was that guy from again? :)  i rather enjoy fez, i really don't expect much from this place but they always deliver.  sweet potato fries with cinnamon...yum!  their menu is innovative...things i would never thought  that would go well together.  yet, it works...it really really works.  :)  if you looking to grab a drink or two...not bad spot to pick in downtown phoenix.</b_review>
<b_review>fez is the go-to place if you want good food, a casual atmosphere, and hip people (who happen to be eye candy, too).  i am from seattle.  fez reminds me a lot of a seattle establishment.  the most obvious aspect for me was the high proportion of glbti people here.  it was refreshing to see this.  but you see straight people, too, and everyone intermingles with no thought of the next person.  the food is pretty good.  what i enjoy the most is that portion sizes are reasonable.  i don't get the sense that because i am paying $20 for my meal, i am going to get something so large that it doesn't fit on the table.  your $20 meal, which isn't expensive at all, gets you quality food that is reasonably sized.  the cost of your wine gets you delicious wine.  your $20 appetizer gets you quality food that is well plated and served freshly.  the ambiance is a little tight inside, especially since it can get busy quickly there.  there is covered seating outside, but in the midst of summer, it can be unbearable to be out there eating hot food in 110-plus-degree heat.  still, it's a casual vibe, and it just feels easy to be there.  any encumbrances that you have in your life seem to go away for the time that you're there.  and that's what makes me like fez so much.  it's much more than just a restaurant or wine bar.  it's a place to go to escape your problems and to be around a diversity of people who, like you, have problems and are escaping them, too.</b_review>

<text>dear holy awesome gluten free menu!!!   i'm 100% excited for a restaurant that's been approved by a celiac association - and they display it right on their door! everything here is awesome - i had the gluten free crush pizza and got the "vegetarian" option. i also had the watermelon mojito - with real chunks of watermelon and mint! they have great gluten free appetizers as well!   this is my new favorite restaurant, and although pretty pricey, it's a great date restaurant, or a good girlfriend date. especially for celiacs, vegetarians, or organic junkies.   a must visit!</text>
<u_review>so, i've always been anti-cartel. i had some pretty negative experiences at the one in downtown phoenix, so i decided it was time to re-engage with the original cartel in tempe.  i first came here several years ago, i believe on some sort of date thingie. it was a really cute place with a ton of hipsters working on laptops or also on dates. the lattes were pretty great, and i thought i could have an ltr with this shop (not the date though).   now, after a few years, i came back to tempe and really appreciated it for the location (there's always parking unless it's a busy night at casey's), and really loved the employee that helped me out. i was buying ground coffee for some friends out-of-town, and he was really helpful. i have a new-found respect for this place, and hope to come back whenever i'm around to get a latte or some of their great tea.   cartel tempe, you've changed me. or at least just changed my thoughts on the cartel brand.</u_review>
<u_review>i've been holding off on writing this review because i feel awful giving it three-stars (though i've been debating two). i've gone 5 times, hoping that every time would be better. however, i've had maybe one four-star worthy experience, and that was only the last time i went.   i was excited to have another local coffee shop downtown, within walking distance from our office. we were big supporters and couldn't wait for the soft opening and then the grand opening (which was actually a great launch event). as someone who loves supporting local when i can, i had such high expectations for this place, which is probably where i'm to blame.   i have yet to have outstanding customer service, and sometimes quite the opposite. it takes a painstakingly long time for them to make the drinks. their sizes are very small in comparison to other coffee joints (including local ones), and pretty pricey. my coworkers complain to me that they don't give discounted refills for iced tea. they have taken my order and charged it, then informed us they ran out of soy. while refunding my order, they didn't offer anything for the inconvenience. i guess i just expected more. but hey, the coffee is actually good, but i'm the kind of gal that would rather have a positive experience instead.  i wanted to like this place, i really did. i'll keep going back when i can during office meetings, hoping to keep getting good experiences. i want everyone reading this to try it for themselves and continue to support local - but for me, i'll go with tried and true corporate coffee instead for the majority of my latte purchases.</u_review>
<u_review>i want to live here and just eat nothing but fresh & easy things. this is possibly the best place ever for single people, however always watch your expiration dates! really great vegetable packages to steam in the microwave - suprised at how reasonable they were, and they taste better in trader joe's...probably due to the fact that they include butter in the package.   this parking lot is a huge pain in the ass, really close spaces and a pain to get in and out of, but it's worth it. don't go right at noon or 5pm, camelback is a pain.</u_review>
<u_review>i love this place, i just wish it was closer to me!  not only do they have almond milk, but they have gluten-free goodies. how awesome! they also offer sunday brunch menu, so count me in for eggs and potatoes with my latte! they have so many baked goods, enough to satisfy any appetite.  i would come in and work here, the furniture isn't the most comfortable i've been in, and plugs are hard to come by with some tables, but it's such a great atmosphere that i don't even care.   the staff is always so nice, what a great place to have a cup of coffee, a date, or a working session.  park in the parking garage, except it gets a little busy on sundays when the church parking is there too.</u_review>
<b_review>great gluten free pizza and beer as well as other italian fare that is organic so tastes fresher!  very accommodating to groups!</b_review>
<b_review>i love pizza.  i love pasta.  i love these two foods more than any other food on earth.  seriously.  you can imagine the first thoughts going through my head finding out that my two favorite foods i love would be off limits.  ugh............the travesty!  oh, the injustice!  then i began searching for places which carried gf pizza crust.  i knew it was out there.  it didn't sound very appetizing, but it's all i can have, so i searched for all the reviews.  i read and researched every one i could find.  i was pretty sure that out of all of the competition one stood head and shoulders above the rest.  was i right?  well, i won't know for a while due to the fact that it's the first gf pizza i've tried.  i seriously doubt that any other gf pizza will ever top it though.  oh, yeah it is that good!  quite honestly, it's one of the better pizza's i've ever had!  gf or not.  where is this place?  picazzo's organic italian kitchen: tempe, az.  they have six arizona locations but this one was inviting, clean (bathrooms spotless), service spectacular and food was delectable.  this place understands gf issues and you feel perfectly fine ordering from them.  they have separate ovens and preparation areas for all gf foods, and so many eating options for the entire family, gf or not.  we started with the gf organic garlic cheese bread.  such a great start!  it is served with olive oil with a few very tasty olives in it.  it could have been a little more "garlicky" for me but it was still extremely good.  light and airy with a terrific amount of cheese on it.  it didn't last long on anyone's plate.  i had the diavalo specialty gourmet pizza.  the gf comes only in medium size.  the crust is quit thin but very tasty.  it consists of an organic tomato sauce, with mozzarella, pepperoni, red and yellow bell peppers, caramelized onions, andouille sausage and red pepper flakes (i did less diavolo and omitted the red pepper flakes!)  the sausage still had a little kick to it but not overpowering.  divine; pure and simple.  the hubs had the pepperoni, sausage and ricotta on picazzo's original crust (not gf) and was extremely happy with his choice.  the mother in law ordered a half order natural chopped italian salad which had so much meat in it she was shocked!  pepperoni, smoked ham, and salami.  it also lettuce,  garbanzo beans, organic tomatoes, a significant amount of fresh mozarella, black olives, pepperoncini, parmesan, gf croutons and italian dressing.  completely gf, huge for a half order and looked amazingly fresh! the child was quite happy with a small cheese pizza!  we then finished the meal with a few desserts.  yes, gf too! i brought most of mine home.  a skillet brownie.  it's about 6 inches around with non dairy organic ice cream and organic chocolate sauce!  joy and bliss rolled into one!   this will be a "go to" place for sure.  probably only for the hubs and me, due to the pricing, but what a date night!  i can have pizza!  it's a little "pizza heaven on earth!"</b_review>
<b_review>love the original owners. use to go here every week but then stopped once they switched owners.....the food became so greasy. not anymore!!!! the original owners are back and it's so yummy!!!! made me and my hubby happy. welcome back!</b_review>
<b_review>this is one of my favorite restaurants in arizona. they have the best salads and delicious pizza. i especially impressed with the quality of food- organic and gluten free.  they changed names for a while but kept a very similar menu . i'm delighted to have picazzo's back in the neighborhood.</b_review>

<text>i really like the size of this venue.  it's not too big, not too small.  it feels cozy in there.  i have complaints about stadium venues for non-sporting events, because for those events, the arenas are usually more than half empty.  my bro-in-law robert d. took me here to see cedric the entertainer.  we had an incredible time.  we sat right in front, and the view was amazing.  the acoustics were great, and we didn't miss anything due to their perfect setup on the stage.    i've been to a couple of other events here, and each time, we had good experiences.  if you get there early enough, you can even find street parking by the side or behind the place.  the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it is located in a dead zone.  after the show, there really isn't anywhere good you can walk to and hang out at near there.</text>
<u_review>the wings here are excellent.  i rate them at the top now that voodoo daddy's is no longer in business.    their other food items are good as well.  nothing too special, but very above average.  the wait staff has always performed to my expectations.  if you are a fan of rootbeer, this is the place for you.  they brew their own, and it is magnificent.  it's got a good bite to it.  this place is able to accommodate different types of customers.  they have an outdoor seating area, they have a large bar equipped with flat screen tv's and surrounding bar tables, bar stools, & booths, they have their general dining area wrapped around the middle of those two areas.    i'd come here for the wings alone.</u_review>
<u_review>let me get this out of the way first..  they sell pacquiao t-shirts!!   anyways, manila sunrise has always been my go-to place for filipino products.  they even have fishball sauce there!  can you believe that?!  where else in the east valley can you get authentic filipino fishball sauce?   their products are fairly priced.  some, i'd even consider cheap.  yeah, a handful of those products are also sold at leelee's, but they are all cheaper at manila sunrise.   you want fried chicken skins?  chicharon?  chippy?  clover chips?  sarsi in glass bottles?  tocino?  longanisa?  filipino themed apparel?  they have it all there at manila sunrise.   the people that work there are pretty cool too.  they really appreciate the patronage you give them.</u_review>
<u_review>in az, this nike store is only second to the anthem store as far as shoe selection goes.  this store has more inventory as far as sizes go, but less variety.  the workers here are top notch.  i've never had any trouble asking for assistance when i needed it.    they also have great sales about 3-4 times a year.  why pay full retail for nikes at other places when you can get them here at a discount.  make their clearance section your first stop when you walk in..</u_review>
<u_review>this place is at a great location.  not a convenient location for me, but eating at a farm is quite charming.  i really like that you have the option to eat indoors or a number of different places outdoors.    the facility is such a futuristic looking building, yet it's on a farm.  quite trippy.  the bathrooms are clean, and they have a convenient hand washing station located near the restrooms.    the food tastes fresh and tasty.  i just had a cheeseburger, garlic fries, and a soda.  some say it's a little pricey, but i think the prices are on par with carl's jr.  believe me, you'd rather be eating food from joe's farm grill.</u_review>
<b_review>yeah. i like dodge theatre. i like the staffers - they're friendly and helpful. i like the bathrooms - they're large and they're clean. i like the music memorabilia on the walls. i like that they allow re-entry. i like that i've sat in all the different sections and never had a bad seat. i like that the sound is pretty much always good. i like that they get some pretty good acts.   oh! i also like the bargain parking option. arrive around 6:30, feed the meter until 8 (about $2) and go have dinner before the show. the meters are free after 8. the best part? cheaper and closer than the garage down the block that charges $10!</b_review>
<b_review>this was a really good venue! the seats we had were very good and all the employees were very helpful and knew what they were doing.</b_review>
<b_review>saw evanescence last night.. had a great time. first time going there. great sound system, comfortable chairs. even for a big guy like me. easy to find. and ushers very helpful.</b_review>
<b_review>-parking: like others have said...park in the street for free. don't get ripped off paying $10 in a parking garage. there were a few empty spots along washintgton.  -seats: made for midgets or pre-school sized kids. if you are average size and are claustrophobic , you will be uncomfortable. forget about crossing your legs...no room. way worse than airplane seats in coach!  -restrooms: ten stalls in the ladies restroom on the west side of the building for hundreds of women = super long line. were there more restrooms somewhere else in the building?   -theatre: huge inside. two jumbo tv screens (not the best quality). friendly & helpful employees. played good pre-show tunes. started show 20 minutes late. did i mention how small the seats were?   would i see another show here...not really.</b_review>

<text>i had a burger here, yes a burger at a sushi place kinda weird huh? it was amazing spicy and amazing.  trust me please trust me.</text>
<u_review>i really want to give it 5 stars but my carne adovada sometimes is kinda fatty. i love this dish but hate sometimes picking through fat. they do have the best chipotle ranch ever!!!</u_review>
<u_review>great place to walk around. tons of great restaurants and tons of shopping.  thursday night art walks are really fun too. great date night with dinner.</u_review>
<u_review>amazing food!  have the gyro with a greek salad and you will love the taste and freshness of each.  the decor is horrible inside the tables looked like they need to be replaced just kinda beat up. if not i would have given 5 stars.</u_review>
<u_review>i don't really know why people don't like this place.  it is american mexican food and is always good.  the salsa is amazing, and the pork burrito i had was perfect.  try this place you will like it.</u_review>
<b_review>it's my 2nd time @ sushi brokers during happy hour and i leave every time with a wide grin on my face.  the drinks are a steal during happy hour and so are the rolls.  this isn't your traditional japanese sushi restaurant. it's more sushi fusion where they'll mix western ingredients with the rolls, such as cream cheese, bbq sauce, etc .  they are mostly lathered with lots of saucing but it's super flavorful without being overwhelming.  definitely give it a shot. the service is great too.</b_review>
<b_review>"trendy, loud-music, ok-sushi!" - 2/5  when we lived right across the street from the sushi brokers, j and i used to go there at least once a month for its happy hour. we probably had been there at least 8 times with friends and family. i have to say that the quality was good for the start but went downhill since then. the price was right if you go during the happy hour. other time, kinda expensive with the quality and service. it was a seen-to-be-seen place with ok-quality sushi.</b_review>
<b_review>best sushi in arizona period.  surprisingly enough they also have the best kobe beef burger that i have ever tasted.  sliders are also very tasty.  lollipop roll, surfer roll, and citrus yellow tail are my favorites.  if you like jalapenos, the jalapeno yellow tail roll is a must try.  great wi-fi connection.  they are launching their own app in a couple of weeks to offer specials on cell phones through text messaging. sounds like a great idea.</b_review>
<b_review>delish is all i need to say.. this place is very popular for happy hour. get there early, by 5:30 the place is almost full. great half price sushi and drinks.</b_review>

<text>az88 is located in the civic center plaza in downtown scottsdale.  i've been there a few times for dinner/drinks and have had mixed experiences.  the first time i went it was just for drinks.  it was very crowded, full of the usual snottsdale types (you know, $30,000 millionaires).  but the drinks and service were good, so i was kept occupied.    the last time i went was later in the evening after a concert.  i don't know if the waiter was tired but he just couldn't be bothered to wait on us.  i rarely leave a waiter with a one or two dollar tip, but this was an exception.    the food is nothing to write home about...very typical burgers, salads etc.  and it's always crowded.  i really don't think it's for the food...it's just the place to be and it's very close to the mondrian.  i'd say that the best part of the place is the people watching.  i've never seen so many chickadees working so hard to look and act like paris hilton.  skip it, unless you are desperate for grub or need a good laugh.</text>
<u_review>as far as breweries go, four peaks pretty much delivers.  four peaks has a good selection of beers on tap - plus a decent seasonal selection.  you're most likely not going for the food.  it's pretty basic bar stuff - chips and dip, chicken fingers, etc.    i went to the location in scottsdale for a friend's birthday recently.  the restaurant was nice enough to give us the entire upstairs section with the pool table.  or maybe they were trying to keep us contained!  they did seem happy when we left.  oops!</u_review>
<u_review>i think pita jungle has great food.  there are choices to satisfy just about any craving.  this location is pretty busy so try to go just when they open or during off hours.  i try to branch out and order new things but my favorite is actually an appetizer: the hummus with grilled chicken.  there is more than enough here for a meal and you will probably end up taking some home.    other favorites include the blue corn nachos and lavosh pizza.  i can't comment on dessert because i never make it.  see above.  they also have a patio area overlooking a really sad "lake", but hey it's nice in december!  enjoy!</u_review>
<u_review>if you like cow, you need to go to delux.  they have the best burgers!  they even have a turkey burger if you are so inclined.    i always go with the standard classic burger, cheddar, extra pickles.  love it!  one thing to watch out for though - the last time i was there i asked for my burger medium and my dining partner ordered medium rare.  the burgers came out more like well done and medium well.  if this type of thing matters to you, stress to your waitress that you really do want it cooked the way you say you do.  then again, it could have been an off night.  i love their sweet potato fries - a guilty pleasure that's also good for you.  delux has a great beer selection too and i've found that the beer flights are the way to go.  the servings are generous and you get to try a few before committing to one.  for those who fear commitment, this is the place to be.  i've never made it to desert so i can't comment.  finally, try to get there early or late, ahead or behind the crowd.  delux is always busy at lunch and dinner time and i've almost always had to wait.</u_review>
<u_review>bad...very bad.  went to this place for dinner on a sunday night.  i felt pretty comfortable when i saw how crowded it was inside.  it doesn't look like much on the outside.  the sushi tasted pretty good, and it was cheap.  one of my dining partners and i both suffered the next day though.  i felt like crud.  i don't know what it was that got me but i suggest you run, don't walk, away.  i should have known that cheap sushi is generally (not always) cheap for a reason.</u_review>
<b_review>i liked the atmosphere there, interior is unique, all of the walls are glass all around.  it was booming last night when we were there.   it is very loud in there so if you are looking for a quite atmosphere, this is not it. they don't seem very organized with respect to having a visible hostess, getting you seated and ordering.  it took us 15 minutes before getting menus.  once we did get acknowledged by the server, she was attentive.   we started off with the galettes w/chopped olives, bacon, carmelized onions and some parmesean cheese w/tomato slices on the plate.  it had a smoky flavor that was really good.  think of these like a super thin cracker.  we then had the waffle fries w/three dips.  - two words - yum - my!  the dips were fantastic.  the menu is simple, mostly hamburgers, chicken sandwiches & salads.  the menu doesn't seem to match the atmosphere.  the burger (au povoire) was very good.  beef burger, bacon, red onion on a fresh bun.  it's worth going once.  they have an awesome outside patio you can sit on as well.</b_review>
<b_review>there's something ironic about az88. it really is a bit of a paradox. but not neatly so. on one hand, the words that other people have used to imply the vibe of the place are fair. it really is all of those things; assuming, euphuistic, grandiose, inflated, magniloquent, pompous, showy,  and sometimes downright snobbish (thank you thesaurus.com). it's in scottsdale. people dress up to go here. coyotes are always on the prowl. that being said, they have $7.00 sandwiches, people in khaki shorts and t-shirts sitting on plastic chairs outside in the 70 degree phoenix winters, and mediocre service (sometimes downright slow). so, i still can't quite get my head wrapped around this place. one thing i did learn is to avoid the cocktail menu unless you're an american express red member. one night a friend and i ordered a martini each and our bill came to $25. with tip almost $30. thanks but no thanks. so, this place is the yin and the yang, the best of times and the worst of times, the id and the superego. i think that you almost have to go once just to decide if you love it or hate it.</b_review>
<b_review>i really enjoyed az88. first off, my friends and i had an amazing bartender that kept giving us remnants of every drink he was making and even made one special for us! the chicken sandwich i had was great, with jalapenos and honey and the fries were perfect! and i really loved the atmosphere. and the bathrooms are worth checking out. they are a great conversation piece.   i'll make my way back to az88!</b_review>
<b_review>i remember when this place opened in 1988 -- it was sleek, served great drinks and eats. i've been back once or twice since then, and it never seems to disappoint.</b_review>

<text>i want to give this place a 1 star rating but my food was actually pretty good.  the service on the other hand was a completely different story.  a couple girl friends and i decided to meet up for dinner on a wednesday night after work.  when we got here it wasn't slammed but it was definitely busier than we expected.  since it was nice outside we wanted a table on the patio and were told it would be a 5-10 minute wait but that we could sit at the bar with a buzzer in the meantime.  the hostess was friendly and helpful.  we get to the bar and make our drink orders right away.  when they were brought out the bartender asked if we wanted to keep a tab or pay as we went.  my friend explained that we were going to be moving outside once a table became available and wanted to know if the tab could be transferred over once we did.  he snapped back that we could do it either way, it was up to us but that it would take longer if we transferred it.  now let me just say that i know reading that line doesn't seem especially rude, but the tone he used was extremely impatient and condescending.  we decided to just pay as we went since it seemed to be such an inconvenience to do anything else.  another thing that apparently bothered him was one of my friends commented that she thought the beer she ordered was supposed to be darker, which she didn't even say to him, she was just commenting on it.  so he grabs a shot glass, pours the beer into it in front of her, slams it down and says, "see?  that's just what it looks like!"  at this point we were all looking at each other like "what is wrong with this guy?"  luckily the hostess came over right at that point to let us know our table was ready.  when our waitress came over we already knew what we wanted since we'd been browsing the menus while we waited so we got that out of the way quickly.  we also all got glasses of water.  our food came out after a reasonable amount of time for how busy they were and as i stated above it was all good.  i got the chicken tortilla soup which was nice and thick, had large chunks of chicken in it and was all around a great combination of flavors.  unfortunately  after our food was brought out we didn't see our waitress again for probably 20 minutes.  so we were all sitting around with empty water glasses until she brought our check out.  we were not happy campers.  so while i did enjoy the food i don't think i'll be returning with the prospect of receiving this kind of service again.</text>
<u_review>when i walk into a mac store i feel like a little kid walking into a candy store.  i get this glow about myself and i'm just in awe of all the pretty things around the room.  unfortunately for my wallet the prices aren't quite as affordable as candy but i make sacrifices (why pay for my water bill when i can buy mascara instead?!  kidding!  but i've thought about it....)  walking into this location was no different and the service was on par with what i expect as well.  i was greeted right away when i walked in and the rep came over to see if i needed help with anything.  i already knew what i wanted but just had questions about which color would be right for me.  the rep made a recommendation and then applied it onto me to make sure it was what i wanted.  easy and professional.  while i was paying, a couple of the other reps complimented my dress and one of my tattoos so we got into a conversation about them and by the end of it i was pulling up my instagram because they wanted to see pictures of my other tattoos too!  it was like they were friends of mine which is the kind of customer service i love, makes me feel welcome and it makes me want to continue to go because i know i'll have a great experience every time.</u_review>
<u_review>i've probably driven by this location a couple hundred times on my way to the gym each day and i finally decided today i was tired of being the whitest girl in my group of friends.  i had checked out the website previously to look at pricing and packages so i pretty much knew what i wanted when i went in.  the girl behind the counter was very friendly and you could tell she was knowledgeable about everything which is always a comforting feeling.  i signed up for the basic package which gives me unlimited access to level 1 and 2 beds and it's only about $32 a month.  i was able to get into a bed right away and the girl recommended a time for me since it had been a while since i'd been tanning.  her recommendation turned out to be a good one as i didn't burn but can see a little color starting to come through.  i'm very happy to have found a nice, clean place to tan with good pricing that's convenient to get to as well.  hopefully i'll be about the same color as the rest of my group by bikini season!</u_review>
<u_review>stopped in for a quick nosh before heading to the diamondbacks game with a few friends today.  the girl at the door greeted us right away and got us seated quickly.  she was very friendly and even when one of my friends spilled his water glass she cleaned it up with a smile and didn't make a big deal about it.  the happy hour is great, i'm not 100% sure of what times it goes from but lucky for us it was on when we got there.  during happy hour you get $4 frozen concoctions, $5 specialty martinis, $2 blue moons, and half price appetizers.  i feel like there may be even more but that's just what i remember off the top of my head.  i ordered the bruschetta and the strand burger.  the bruschetta was great, the bread was perfectly crispy and it was loaded with fresh tomatoes, basil and mozzarella and i think there was some kind of red wine sauce that was drizzled over it too, really tasty!  the burger however wasn't quite my cup of tea.  i can't really even explain why, almost like the flavors just didn't blend well together, but i didn't even finish half of it and a couple of my friends who tried it also felt the same way.  the parmesan fries that came with it on the other hand were delicious!  i'll definitely come back because of the great service and the prospect of good food, i just won't be ordering the burger again.</u_review>
<u_review>they serve sandwiches that you custom order for $2.99....that could be my entire review but i'll give more details just to paint a better picture.  you walk in, directly ahead you see the delicatessen counter and hanging above that a sign advertising custom order sandwiches for $2.99.  you'll ask yourself if it's a dream or not, how could such a deal exist when you've been paying $10+ for lunches everywhere else?  and how could you have gone this long without knowing of such a place?  once you've come to your senses and regained composure you'll walk up to the counter and a slightly rude woman will bark at you to fill out the order form with what you want on your sandwich and to then leave it on the counter.  you'll take your time with your selections, making sure to compose the ideal combination of bread, meat, cheese and condiments.  when you've finished you leave the form on the counter to be prepared and try to make yourself look occupied as you wander the store waiting for your masterpiece to be created.  then that glorious moment when your name is called, signalling that your creation awaits.  the only thing left is to do is pay and drive as quickly (while trying to remain safe) as possible back to whatever location you plan to eat at so that you may enjoy it.</u_review>
<b_review>happy hour review only  met up with some friends here for half price appetizers and discount drinks before the giants/cubs game on a thursday evening.  between four of us we split 2 orders of chicken nachos (extra cheese), 2 orders of sliders, calamari, and the poki tuna stack.  my favorite by far was the poki stack with this kick ass soy/wasabi dressing circling the plate which will clear your sinuses in no time.  the nachos and sliders are my friends' favorites.  they were okay, nothing special.  calamari was not all that special either, bread crumb crust with marinara instead of battered with aioli.  i do however, highly recommend the $4.50 margaritas, big and tasty.  with all that food and two drinks each the bill came out to $20 a person. we left stufffed and still probably spent less money than we would have on ball park food.  our server was chipper and accomodating even timing our last round for right at the 6pm happy hour cut off buzzer.  i would definitely go back again for happy hour, i don't think i would want to pay the regular prices after all that.</b_review>
<b_review>while visiting fashion square mall, my friend suggested we splurge and have a nice dinner. after looking at the menu, we decided to try it.  i enjoyed the mac + cheese- which was a large portion of  chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar, parmesan, campanelle pasta & truffle oil. it was truly delicious and i enjoyed every bite of it. i paid extra for a ceasar salad that was nothing special, but still good.  my friend enjoyed the  rib eye (12oz) with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans & shallot butter. she stated it was the best steak that she had ever had. she also paid extra for a salad, and felt the same about her salad, but she also asked for extra ranch dressing, which never arrived.  my friend  also enjoyed a bikini martini that i had a taste of. it was just lovely but due to the prices of the drinks, opted to not have one.  the prices were kind of high to us, and our server didnt really give us warm fuzzy feelings, and at times we felt sort of rushed to complete our meal.  i think perhaps as a special occasion i would go again, perhaps not.  but it was definitely worth a try and the menu is diverse enough to have something cheaper.</b_review>
<b_review>i had the worst experience at this location. i was in town on vacation and my friends from phx suggested we go here. our group was about 12-15 of us and it took us a while to be seated -- fine, whatever, no biggie.  but once we sit, out waiter takes forever to even say hi to us, small talking with the table behind us (the only other people he was serving). so finally he comes over and before we ordered anything, i wanted to get a round of shots to start off our vacation. six shots took twenty minutes to come -- and the bar was an arm's length away. so i wanted to saddle up the shots bill right away -- i was charged gratuity for shots. whatever, i just won't tip on it and let it pass.  also, as someone mentioned above -- all of us were carded and hassled for our out of state ids, even though everyone in our group was over 25.  the waiter continues to take forever and becoming frustrated, i just start to go to the bar myself to get drinks. after my 2nd or 3rd round, the manager tells me i need to stop going to the bar to get my drinks and i have to let the waiter serve them (they really want that gratuity). he sits down and i tell him how slow and frustrated i am with his service. he tells me he'll make it better, asks me what i want to drink and says "i got it."  so, you'd think free beer on the house, right? nope! i get a tab at the end of the night for that drink. i hand the bill to the manager and he says, "i never said it was free, i said i would get it for you." oh, thanks for your great service.  will never ever step foot in this place just because of the customer service. food and drinks were fine, but up there with some of the worse service i've had.</b_review>
<b_review>this was my first time at the yard house and it was a very pleasant experience. first off, i liked that the server said "welcome ladies" instead of the usual...hi guys that we usually get everywhere when we are woman! hello!! we are not guys. it is one of my pet peeves. the waitress was friendly and attentive that not overly bothersome, so i give tai 5 stars!!  i ordered a club sandwich and it was huge and stuffed full of turkey, avocado and bacon. they also substituted the fries for a house salad at no extra charge. they also had my favorite 4 peaks peach beer and it was nice and cold.  i will defiantly patronize this place again!!</b_review>

<text>this long series of interconnected parks that runs along the indian bend wash is a good reason for me to buy a bike. here you have a bike path that runs many miles, lots of grass, trees, a stream that connects several ponds frequented by various wading birds, a challenging skateboard area, and other recreational features - most notably disc golf areas. i haven't heard of disc golf until i came here and a disk golfer yelled "fore!" at me because i was blocking the path of his frisbee disc while i was trying to photograph the wading and diving birds in one of the ponds (oh yeah - see the pics i took ... woohoo!) this place is quite a schlepp from where i live, but it's worth the drive because i love the scenery here ... and i have a lot of fun using my push scooter on part of the extremely long bike path. i said part, because the bike path runs about 25 miles each way. eventually i'll get around to buying that bike.</text>
<u_review>so glad i found this place, and in my neighborhood at that. my car's tires need to be replaced, so i went to their website and was able to view the specs, ratings, and reviews for the tires. when i went to the actual shop, i was treated with courtesy and did not have to deal with any high-pressure sale pitches. i was even allowed to review my options in the shop and chose a set of tires that was well suited for my driving style and budget. it took them only 30 minutes to do everything, and i used that time to get coffee and breakfast in one of the many dining establishments nearby. a pleasant experience overall.</u_review>
<u_review>i had dinner here tonight with friend and fellow yelper john m. rather than ordering individual items, we decided to try a half bandeja: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nsmtvggirpj4mj9jznw-ea?select=3wqjvxtp_2auqsacnl_k0g (a full bandeja feeds 4 people), which turned out to be a very good choice. the savory array in the bandeja included tostones, rice, carotas negras (black beans), fried eggs, blood sausage, chorizo, grilled steak, shredded beef, avocado halves, sweet fried plantains ... and an arepa, of course. if you come here with company, i highly recommend the half or full bandeja (depending on the number of people in your party) - it's a lot of really good food and you get to try an array of dishes that go very well together.</u_review>
<u_review>this place, though easily accessible because of its proximity to the tempe marketplace, can be easy to miss because it's tucked within a commercial complex in an industrial area. inside, the setting is simple and very informal, and lighting is at a comfortably low, relaxing level. service is efficient and friendly, and of course the pizza is quite good. a big plus for me is that people with gluten restrictions can opt for a gluten-free crust, which means i can come here with a group and enjoy pizza like everyone else. i guess the only grouse i have about the place is that parking can be tricky during peak hours.</u_review>
<u_review>great sausages (from schreiner's), creative and tasty combinations for fixins, on hot naan bread. and wonderful, friendly people - they made sure that i enjoyed what i ordered. a great meal, definitely. i wish there were more than one truck, and i wish one were stationed closer to where i live.</u_review>
<b_review>i love this park to death. growing up one of my favorite drives was down hayden since it was so green and had nice lakes to look at, sports fields full of people, ramadas full of celebrating.   now i live in an apartment close by and the green belt may influence where i buy my next home. i have never rode it past camelback rd but i understand you can take this all the way up to north scottsdale. i have taken it from south all the way to tempe town lake and beyond.   it just amazes me the trail system metro phoenix has. it really is underestimated. there are miles and miles of beautiful parks along the scottsdale green belt that it's a no brainier if your planning an outdoor family event this is the place to do it. even challenge some of your friends to bike to your event so they can get hooked on the awesomeness of this.   so if enjoy the outdoors or doing anything outdoors, look into making a visit to this place.</b_review>
<b_review>great place for picnics, parties, playing games etc but as a photographer it has never failed me! love scottsdale greenbelt! great place for everyone!</b_review>
<b_review>i biked the entire thing today! omg i loved it! i started at the mustang library and went to curry and miller. had a cereal bar and turned around. i did it on my mountain bike and had fun. it's the longest ride i've ever done. it goes through multiple parks and golf courses. plenty of good looking women (i'm a guy) and nice people to wave to you. i had a great time. this is a hidden treasure in the valley. much nicer than biking on canal paths!</b_review>
<b_review>i'm publicly apologizing for every terrible thing i've said about scottsdale, because i just discovered the green belt. i rank this feature as one of the crown jewels of the valley. seriously. along with camelback mountain, pizzeria bianco, the biltmore, the phoenix suns, asu coeds and mexican food, it's something you have to try to understand why those of us who love living here do so. how it existed for this many years without my really knowing about it (including one year living in old town scottsdale), i don't know. it's embarrassing.   it so happens that i might be able to use the gb to commute to work. i can take the train to tempe town lake (center parkway station), then bike up the belt to north scottsdale. replacing my boring freeway drive now with a work-out that takes me past lakes, trees, fountains, golf courses, ducks, canada geese... yeah, i think i can deal with that 8 months a year.</b_review>

<text>yum. after doing some shopping at the mekong plaza we decided on having lunch here. very clean, which is a big plus for a vietnamese establishment. the food was great, very tasty. would love to back.</text>
<u_review>we went for the free evaluation as my child needed a cranial helmet. initially it was a bit hard to find, but we got there, hidden behind the hospital and we've been to pch several time before. the way they treated me and my child was friendly, but i baby had to wait in it's diaper in a very cold room for over 30 minutes. by that time it was tired and cold. the insurance consultant was going to contact us. finding out insurance wouldn't cover it, they still would charge us $3500 out of pocket. (ouch). no wonder they have the fancy, unnessecary calendar each year. one other thing i didn't like about it is the way the do the measurements the pull a stocking (like) cover over baby's head, make him sit between 17 flashing cameras to get the measurements.  i am so happy when an other mom told me about http://www.yelp.com/biz/hanger-prosthetics-and-orthotics-phoenix (hanger). they have basically the same product and what a nice enviroment. no they don't have the super, duper fancy office and calendar. howver, they said, because insurance wouldn't cover it  they would `charge us $1500, still out of pocket, but doable. also the measurements were done so much more friendlier. baby sat on my lap, the stocking was cut open and they used a hand laser scanner, while some else played with him. one big thing i appreciated about hanger is when they brought out the flashing toys to disctract baby, they asked if he ever had seizures as those kind of toys can trigger them. cranial consultant never asked a thing and just ran their routine. my baby looks awesome in his hanger helmet.</u_review>
<u_review>we really used to love the place for the chips and sals bar as well.  food is good, not excellent. they changed their concept, by ordering in advance and getting it delivered at you table to being waited at the table and having a small basket of chips and salsa served. it's okay, but not my favorite.</u_review>
<u_review>love the food and what a great prices, how can they pull it off. ate there twice now and would live to go more often if i had the chance. service is great and friendly. great young coconuts with loads of juice and meat for a great pirce. the 1 star missing is for the gross high chair we recieved for my child. i had to go to the car to get a cover to have him sut in it. also the floor and walls can use a serious scrub down. however the food is so awesome, i'll see it through, just here.</u_review>
<u_review>forget starbucks, they have the best coffee here. as a european it's clear that they don't know how to make coffee in america, until you get to joe's diner. they have the story behind their coffee on their menu. the servers think apparently so too, as one brought me a cup and 5 seconds later another offered me a refill when i hadn't started yet. and she asked me if i was sure.  the pastrami sandwich was good. not excellent, have had better. if i could come in just for a fix of coffee i would be very happy.</u_review>
<b_review>hasian: hot + asian  i love hot asian food, and when you come to unphogettable, that's what you will get.  i've been here a few times and i've never been disappointed. the restaurant is attached to the mekong plaza.  on this lovely evening, i had the #1, and i had the rare steak on the side. the staff had no problem accomodating my request. the spring (actually autumn) rolls were phenom in the peanut sauce. try it. you'll like it.  everything is fresh. i don't have any complaints about this place. at least none that i would yelp about.   the pho is phantastic (see what i did there?). the broth comes out at the perfect temperature, and there are enough bean sprouts and basil leaves for your palate.   the name is cute. duh.</b_review>
<b_review>stopped in here tonight at the recommendation of fellow yelpers. this place did not disappoint. it was very clean, unlike some vietnamese spots i have been to, and the staff was prompt, attentive and friendly. my friend and i both ordered pho. i had the #9 and it was awesome. the broth was full of flavor and delicious. we also shared an order of the fried rice. which was wonderful as well. it was non-greasy and full of goodies. i am definitely a fan and will be returning.</b_review>
<b_review>this is the best pho broth around it has everything you would want in good pho...it's clear, the taste is amazing, and oh so yummy...the staff is awesome too</b_review>
<b_review>the young lady that helped us was very friendly and the flavor of the pho was good. just right across the street from my work-out place and so yummy!</b_review>

<text>fun place.  great atmosphere.  food is just awful.  waitresses are great at throwing extra drinks on your bill.  happened more than once so check your tab.</text>
<u_review>sitting on the patio eating pate with a nice bottle of wine - can't beat that.  well you couldn't beat it if the patio didn't look like the inside of my garage.  indoors is pretty nice and the pate is good.</u_review>
<u_review>three of us went for dinner.  we ordered the spring rolls that come 2 at a time.  so i asked if they could give us 3 spring rolls instead - just toss on another and charge us for it.  "oh no.  the cooks won't do that.  you have to get two orders" .  so we get two orders.  we ordered several other items and finally when we were done, we had one spring roll on the table.  when i asked for it to be boxed the server asked if i really wanted it.  heck yeah - you made me buy an extra one - feel free to box one spring roll.  the service was pretty much like that the whole night.  i'd suggest take-out.  they ask you what kind of spice rating you want - medium, hot, etc.  i'm not sure why, the medium was hotter than the hot which doesn't say much.  there's no thai spicy at this place.</u_review>
<u_review>you have to love a place that still cares enough to use half a stick of butter when they cook your meal.  throw in some bourbon candied sausage and you have a real old fashioned breakfast cafe.</u_review>
<u_review>i'm not really a big fan of getting food that has ingredients that aren't mentioned on the menu.  not just my meal but my friends had food that wasn't exactly what we ordered.</u_review>
<b_review>if you come before a coyotes game or sporting event they are jammed.  i agree the service is good, even when they are scrambling around with a full restaurant.  usually just have a couple drinks before watching the yotes.  small crowd tonight.  i asked the waitress if they made their own veggie burger.  yes they do. it was good. friends shared the bbq chicken sandwich and liked it.  sides were good.   it is on par with the other restaurants around the arena.  i do agree plastic glasses suck.  we all picked up our beers and said plastic? really?   probably a 3.5 but i've only been there on a game night.  the place is full inside and on the patio so that says something.  it's not ruth's chris.  it is what it is</b_review>
<b_review>went here tonight. yes, i know it's a weekend at westgate, and expected them to be busy. there wasn't a long wait to get sat. took us a little while to get our drinks out, and then we ordered our food. it took over an hour to get our food out to us, our server she had only checked on us a couple of times, and didn't after the bread sticks, despite the fact that she saw me looking over at her several times during the meal. about 50 minutes after waiting, i went to go look for her to ask where our food had went, couldn't find her. i did see her as well as other servers hanging out with other tables. the table next to us even had to get their own silverware after the food had been brought out. i ended up walking out, paying for my drink and not even getting out food. i had to go somewhere else to eat completely. the server never came over to apologize about our wait, no manager, no other servers came to check up on us after the biscuits were brought out.i even offered to pay for my drink, which she took a while to bring out the check for that, keeping me their angry even longer.it seems like they are very selective about who they serve, saw a lot of girls hanging out with the guys at the tables while other tables were waiting.  horrible horrible service..i couldn't even find a manager to complain to.</b_review>
<b_review>staff was friendly but place is overpriced.  servings are  large but not good.  the platters look better than they taste. would not eat there again  after trying it now a few times.  maybe for a beer before going to the arena but that is about it.</b_review>
<b_review>i was looking for a place for dinner before going to before the movie.  there a quite a few restaurants at westgate, so we looked around and chose this saddle ranch.    wrong choice!  the hostess was friendly, and we were seated right away.  the waitress had a great personality, but service was average at best.   this place is a little on the pricy side.  the food didn't justify the cost.  i had a baseball cut sirloin, which came with a vegetable medley and one side.  i chose the loaded baked potato. the vegetables were the best part but were just ok.  the steak was supposed to come with choice of a sauce, glaze or butter, but is was left off.  it was no better or bigger than a chili's or applebee's steak, but was twice the price.  the flavor and tenderness of the meat was just average, but was cooked to the the way i ordered it.   the baked potato was large, but had been sitting in a warming drawer for a while and had that off-putting old baked potato taste.  i ordered it with the loaded potato part on the side.  i thought a loaded potato had butter, sour cream, bacon bits, chives, and sometimes grated cheese.  i got a small plastic container with about one tablespoon of sour cream, and barely a teaspoon of butter.  i ate some of it because i was hungry, but left over half.  later, when the waitress asked about the meal, i told her about the old potato.  she told the manager.  he came later asked about the meal and offered to replace the potato, or substitute another side, but i was done eating.  he said he would comp a desert.  the waitress said that we were getting the vanilla brioche bread pudding.  we waited for at least another twenty minutes, but when she finally brought it, she brought an ice cream sundae, saying the were out of the bread pudding...the final letdown.  this is a very attractive looking restaurant, but i don't understand why the kitchen would send out a substandard meal unless they just don't care  maybe that is the norm for this here.  for a place that bills itself as a chop house, it leaves a lot to be desired.</b_review>

<text>scary things to me: paris hilton has a career.  sarah palin. really. she's like the new anita bryant.  my fathers' overgrown eyebrows. trim, daddy, trim! droves of high schoolers leaving school just as i'm trying to find barrio cafe.   seriously. like thousands of them. and i couldn't find the damn restaurant. what was i gonna do? roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, "hey, squeeze me fellas, i'm going to a wine tasting at the barrio cafe. y'all know where that is?" since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me.   finally. i found it. and entered.   cute. cozy. middle of the day, so empty. great, vibrant art. and a very attentive and friendly staff. often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. no ball dropping here. i had la paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. think squirt and patron! and after a couple of these babies i was in el bano squirting out that patron. dee lish however.   i ordered the enchiladas del mar. enchiladas of the sea for my non spanish speaking peeps. you know what? it was good. not great. and the presentation was somewhat messy. i couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). they were lost in the sauce and the cheese. but i devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. my friend had a chickent torta. big and rustic. like janet reno. she loved it!   i will most definitely be back. hopefully i will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl i will pick that barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off.   oh. that's blow my socks off. btw. adios for now mi yelpitas!</text>
<u_review>all male employees are required to have the spiky, messy, moussey hair look in order to keep their jobs. apparently. it kills me. it's like attack of the retail clones. and the men's department isn't much more inventive. it's like the greg norman collection threw up all over. kinda like dad golfing clothes meets 18 different kinds of various polo style shirts. now, the men's shoe department....when they have sales....is toe tappin' fun. great shoes and great deals. consciously disheveled hair man (with the funny mustache) is the most helpful. love the piano playin, especially around the holidays. very new york. but the men's department? i have better luck at macy's.</u_review>
<u_review>dayum you gabi! i had it my mind (fuzzy as it has been since sunday) to be the ftr on this event. well. who cares! what a fabulous day. it was like seeing family. i saw industry folk, lots of yelpers and so many of my customers and neighbors from the cenpho hood!  corn dogs from district! seriously. i could eat those babies for breakfast.  gelato from chelsea's kitchen!? seriously i could eat that for breakfast! sea scallops with pea risotto from a different pointe of view. yep. breakfast. eggs over easy. done deal. and the wine! the tequila. and the dragonberry rum. yep. hair of the dog. breakfast all the way.  pam has never looked prettier to me. and by the end of the day. everyone i saw had never looked prettier to me. recall the wine, tequila and rum!  great event. go phoenix foodies!  five stars. great double date with rickie, anton and dave.   the only bad things was the neon green drink band clashed with my black and pink hello kitty bracelet.  hmmm...</u_review>
<u_review>ok. i've decided next time i enter the kiehl's area of the cosmetic section to simply take a sharpee and write sucker across my forehead. those fancy ladies with their fancy smocks, see two gay guys headed their way and i can see the dollar signs replacing their pupils. ka ching! really, i just need a face lotion. hmmm....17 different kinds. all with hard to pronounce extracts and oils. do i need the fortifying baobab skin therapy? or maybe the centella recovery skin salve. or perhaps the creamy avocado eye treatment? ok, i could pronounce avocado. and yes, i tasted it. nothing like guacamole. i get great customer service here. i'm not intimidated like other folks seem to be. gimme a break. they're retail workers. nothing wrong with that at all. then why do i know so many people who won't go there cuz they're "afraid" of the employees. get a spine people. and while you're there, i'm sure you'll find some kind of spine lotion or salve.  the men's department is fantastic as well. i pretty much only shop there when i see those wonderul clearance signs calling my name.  best part of needless mark up is the free valet parking. nothing worse than circling the narrow parking garage across the street. i always use the valet service here even when i'm not shopping at neiman's. oh, and leave the visa and mastercard at home, cuz they don't take them. i know that makes people crazy. but c'mon, it's a dallas based store....need i say more!</u_review>
<u_review>this reminds me nothing of the cafes i ate at while in paris. sadly, however, i wasn't in france, but texas. yes, paris, texas. my car broke down. i believe i had a cowboy omelet and a large ice tea while waiting for the repair. here, at zinc bistro, i pretend i'm paris, france. a glass of burgundy with the french onion soup and some pomme frittes and i say wee wee! i've had good service here. although i've seen larger tables having issues with flagging servers down. it's like they can't rememeber to ask for everything at once and the servers is doing some serious wind sprints from the kitchen to the table. the manager is way cool and always remembers me. i do love the bistro style atmosphere here and love hearing other peoples conversations when i dine a lone. i know. shameful. but one couple was actually signing their divorce papers over a steak and a bottle of champagne.</u_review>
<b_review>the fish tacos here are freakin awesome.  i also had a dish that was a pepper stuffed duck and pomegranite that was soo good.  again, phoenix food is terrible except the mexican food (see review for los sombrero's).  their isn't a lot of seating available so reservations are a plus.  also, no chips and salse, instead bread and tapanade.  that loses some points, but the fish tacos and other food make up for it.  desserts are so-so, but mexican dessert isn't really my thing.</b_review>
<b_review>yum! so far this is the best restaurant i've been to in phoenix. the service was fantastic.  they made us feel like we were visiting their house for sunday dinner.  the guacamole with pomegranate was extremely tasty and the fresh tortilla chips were some of the best i've had.  for entrees, i was between the shrimp or the fish tacos and asked the server for his advise.  he told me he'd suprise me.  love it! i ended up with the fish tacos and they were some of the best fish tacos i've ever had.  coming from san diego, that's a pretty big feat.  my husband had the chili relleno with shrimp and scallops and it was soooo tastey! i really wish we would have saved room for dessert.  the flan or the churros looked unbelievable.  next time!  i hardly ever give 5 stars so check this place out!</b_review>
<b_review>i am probably wasting my time with this review, seeing as there are well over 100 reviews. but, i have to because i really wonder why all the hype. yeah, the food is really good. but, the portions are small and really, really pricey. you get half as much as you would expect at twice the price. not to mention they tout the chef and menu being inspired by her childhood in southern mexico. so when i ordered my entree and the waitress asked me would i like fries or salad with it, needless to say i was more than a bit surprised. what? did she grow up in mexico having fries with her tacos?  the place is tiny and incredibly noisy. you don't have a conversation there, you have a shouting match. and it is full of forty and fifty-something urban and hip upper middle class. (although, is there a middle class anymore?) not that there is anything wrong with that, i think it just speaks to the the food, prices and atmosphere.there is barely enough room to navigate and the near misses between the staff and the customers are something to see. again, the place is not bad. i would probably like it a lot more if it were a lot less expensive. but, i think the barrio cafe is more hype than anything else and i don't think they deliver.</b_review>
<b_review>i have been wanting to try this place out for some time. i had some vendors who came into town, and this is where we ended up for dinner.  it really wasnt what i expected. it kind of through me for a loop. i mean, its in a very run down neighborhood (signs say park at your own risk) with bars over windows and doors. you get in, and it looks kind of average, nothing to hint that there are some food gods working behind the wall.  they pretty much do tequilla only here. they have a tequilla list with over 100 tequillas on it. i opted for a simple margaritta with some tequilla i have never heard of and some fresh agave nectar. wow it was good!  we got the guacamole appetizer, and it was fantasic. all fresh made right at the table. next we moved onto the shrimp quesedillas. this was kind of an insight as to how complex these meals were going to be. the shrimp quesadillas were very good, so much so i didnt even realize i accidently ate the shrimp tail!   looking at the menu for dinner, its definatley not your everyday mexican food your going to see here. this is kicked up a notch. i would probably call this gourmet mexican food. never have i seen such menu items, where everything sounds so fantastic. it was like i was in mexican food heaven! i had the special of the night which was a basted lobster tail in tequilla grilled over an open wood flame, 6oz filet mignon with a langustine/chorizo goat chease mixture on top, and grilled vegetables. i think it was their way of doing the filet 'oscar style'. it was extremely good. everything turned out fantastic.  my only complaint was parking. it was pretty tight to begin with. our server was strictly to the point, no lolly gagging around which actually turned out to be good in this instance for us since this was a business dinner.  would definatley visit again!</b_review>
