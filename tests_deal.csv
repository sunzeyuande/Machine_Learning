"college crowd obviously, but i needed to mention that the sampler appetizer platter is a complete ripoff at $10.79. you get three items, but hardly any of each. four mozzarella sticks, a few lousy boneless wings and they sliced the avocoda egg rolls in half, maiking it appear that you got more. as a matter of fact, there more sauces than food items on the plate and those were the thing that had leftovers. no late night happy hour like most other chili's either. it was good to have blue moon on tap since last night was the rare ""blue moon"". my version of a double double.",-1
"3.8 stars.  pretty good pub atmosphere, great chips and pretty good fish, especially for the desert.  my fish could best be described as a plank.  three good size cod fillets that were bonded together by the beer batter.  in the traditional english style, i prefer the haddock fillets but you really only find that in england and new england.  the batter was laid on a bit heavier than i care for but it was still good batter.  the chips were nice long slices...perfect.  the tarter sauce was slightly sweet, i prefer it tangier.  portions were good, particularly for the fish.  *fyi-  fibber mcgee & molly was an early and long running radio show and is considered by many to be a precursor to the modern sitcom.",-1
"ever since i started getting daily e-mails from my bureaucratic overlords reminding me of the impending layoffs, unpaid furloughs and ""department consolidations"" i have to look forward to, i've been cutting back on going out and actually enjoying myself. mostly because they cut all my hours and i still need to find a way to pay my therapist.  so for the last week or so it's (haha, proper use of the apostrophe, bitches) been ramen noodles, rice, ramen noodles, peanut butter, and ramen noodles.   i've been trying to make the most of it. i look up ramen recipes on the internet. i make aesthetically pleasing bentos out of them. i even put pictures of my lunch on my livejournal, perhaps to maintain the illusion that i'm ""challenging myself"" rather than desperately clinging to the edge of poverty.  alas, no how i try to psyche myself, there is no pick me up for the buzz kill one experiences when eating 15 cent noodles in front of your computer when your stomach and smug sense of culture are screaming for something...more...  like dim sum. like great wall's dim sum.  this morning i was stewing another batch of ""failure food"" when the insane craving for dim sum hit me like homosexual tendencies striking a fundamentalist preacher giving a sermon on how g*d hates rastafarians.  on the outside, great wall looks like another two-bit strip mall attraction. you know, like all the stores next to it. but inside it's like the dining room of hotel awesome, where somewhat discontent-looking servers push around carts of delicious and deliver plates of fuck yeah to your table where you and your party can divvy them up/fight over them. whatever fits your interpretation of darwinism.  to be honest i'm surprised more people don't fight over the food.  for a mound of their delicious lo mein i would probably break a chair over someone's face.   for a plate of their pork buns i would falcon punch someone in front of their kids.  this may seem a little aggressive...but it can be a fucking battle royale in there.  especially when you don't have anyone in your party who speaks the language.  ""uh, yes, i'll take some of that, no, that, yes the thing with the shrimp in it. oh, and some of that, too. no. to the right. yes. oh shit, where'd our ticket go?""  i remember watching a muppet babies episode once where the children were eating gruel or something and they suggested trying to imagine it as something tastier.  i tried that. it's a lot harder than it looks.  you swirl those nickel-and-dime noodles around on your fork and you try to imagine crab puffs or plates of peppered shrimp or mango pudding.  you try to imagine being surrounded by all your friends, plus some people you've just met, plus a whole restaurant of people speaking in their cafeteria voices (i.e. screaming at the top of their lungs).  and then you open your eyes and take a bite.  and you realize that you're alone in front of your computer screen with a mouth full of chopstick because in your daydreaming you drop your ramen all over yourself.   fuck.  i would crash a mini-motorcycle into someone's groin right now for a plate of their lumpia or shrimp dumplings.  dammit.  does anyone need someone to paint their nails and take them out shopping?   i can't keep living like this.",-1
"ken is still tops in my book, but just a quick update as today i experienced not only a perfect mani/pedi from julie/lia but lia proceeded to give me an acupressure massage for 20 minutes on my feet up to my knees.  note, it was an extra $30, but thirty bucks for twenty minutes in heaven isn't bad in my book!  every time i visit ken's, i get an extremely warm greeting (thank you amy and ken) and i leave pleased and feeling pretty.    take advantage of the yelper specials when you go; ironically, i keep forgetting to do so!",-1
"as a bar, monkey pants seems to want it both ways.  they have a 1:00am shirtless shot routine that makes the place feel like an annoying college bar.  at the same time, the atmosphere is decidedly low-key, especially considering the ""wacky"" and ""outrageous"" name.  i've been there on a few friday nights and, each time, could count on one hand the number of patrons.  if nobody is going there, it must not just be me.  maybe it's better during lunchtime...  time out lounge is in the same strip-mall.  i'd recommend drinking there instead.",-1
"had lunch on a hot sunday.  they are not open but owner will whip up lunch for you while he's prepping the next weeks food.  had pad see ewe - good.  had khao soi (curry noodle soup) - hard to find and often bad -downright awesome, just like i had in chiang mai - turn out owner is from there.  makes authentic nam prik (look it up) if you ask.  damn! right here in chandler, i'm tearing up. going in the rotation for sure.",-1
"9/3 walked in ten minutes before 6p.  just in time to order a few apps during happy hour!  however, half-priced happy hour apps and beverages were very limited in number and marked with smiley faces, and they were so hard to spot on the menu!  perhaps having only ten minutes to hunt them down exacerbated my difficulty of spotting them, but i hope the managers consider having separate easy-to-read menus printed and used.  liked that martini-drinkers have many martinis to select from. tried a couple of rolls, but i can't recall much to write about except that i would probably come back to try other apps and entrees not on the hh menu, but i'm in no hurry to go back.",-1
"""why is everything i touch sticky?""  that pretty much sums things up for saddle ranch. we sat at the bar for a quick drink before heading in to jobbing.com arena. we were robbed, sweated a bit in the lack of air condition, and got sticky in the process.   also, what's the deal with the plastic cups that are supposed to look like glass? they just look scratched up and dingey. nasty.  for $25 all we got was 1 beer, 1 mixed drink and 2 sad shots. waste of money. go  to the yard house for better beer and atmosphere.",-1
"i've gone to honey bears now twice. first time was when i was a teenager with my grandparents. was not impressed. since it had been st least 15 years, i figured is give out another go. honestly, i've made better bbq at home. for the price they charge you, of rather go to famous daves.   pork was dry. ribs were fatty. cobbler was gluey and tasted like it was comstock pie filling.   thank goodness we ate using a deal chicken offer.",-1
"the dirty rice and boudin at baby kay's are really quite wonderful - a local treasure in phoenix. baby kay's and papadeaux's take the prize for cajun restaurants so far in phoenix, with good food at reasonable prices. the lunch is a little pricier here - and so i recommend baby kay's for dinner because it's the same price. but hey if greekfest across the street is full for lunch, pop over to baby kay's. the food is consisistently good - gumbo, jambalaya and oyster po-boy. highly recommended.",-1

"if you are looking for an old fashioned ice cream parlor this is the spot.  the food is also old school diner type food, the meatloaf is pretty good, but it is meatloaf after all, not a porterhouse steak.  the desserts are rich and the ice cream is decent, wish they would have more flavors though.  the servers are mostly young high school age kids who sometime spend too much time talking with their friends.  it is what it is.",-1
"the salsa they hand you with the chips tastes like, i don't know, agent orange?  it doesn't taste good.  my tostada was swimming in a pool of grease.  my enchilada was decent.  the taco i had gave off an aftertaste that was remarkably similar to a fart.  it had a crunchy shell that can cut up your gums.  goddamn, everyone who works here is so nice.  i feel bad giving it two stars but the food was really, honestly, not very good.  i am not a picky eater, really.  i am easy to please.  if i tell you a place has lousy food, then man, you are gonna shit your pants.",-1
"me want to likey likey but no can do.   i'm disappointed in this place and the 4-star rating it got. how misleading. i should have known this place was no good when i didn't see a single thai person in the joint. don't tell me they were all in the back cooking either. its like walking into a mexican restaurant and all the wait staff were chinese. well... now its sounding like chinobandito. anway--- i digress.  i came in for lunch and the menu was expansive! i've never seen so many words that begin with k.  i wanted to try something different than my regular pad thai, curry, tom yum but i couldn't decide and went off something from their lunch menu. i think it was thai bbq chicken with spicy sauce. i figured, i can't go wrong with that. not traditional thai but i couldn't make up my mind about the others.   well, they ran out. i wasn't sure if they ran out of thai bbq or chicken. apparently its bbq so i settled for the sesame chicken. bad idea. when in thai- i should probably order thai... but... um.. how do you screw up sesame chicken? the panda express has mastered it! now you!  it will be a while before i try this place out again but i just didn't expect them to not be able to cook. i will start at a one-star for now and promise to order an authentic dish next time so i can be a better judge.  i did have the thai milk tea and that was good. so one-star for good tea!",-1
"delicious!  joe's is the best bbq that i tried in az.  i loved all their selections because they have something for everyone, from ribs to giant baked potatoes.  there is really not much i can say that the other reviewers have't said though so i'll just leave it with a 2 thumbs up!   oh, and i love the old tractor that's inside. haha  it's a classic... a 1948 a series tractor.  tad, the owner told me so! :)  see ya there!",-1
"i love you.  i love you not.  i love you.  dear nee house,   i live no more than a 1/2 mile from you, and am a regular. i have waited to write this review, because of our love/hate relationship.    i love your food.  my family loves your food.    your yang zhou fried rice is heavenly.  it's loaded with shrimp, char siu pork, and vegetables.  i don't even mind that your spell it young chow on your menu.     the first time you made me pan fried prawns with honey walnuts i almost wept with joy.  the generous serving of prawns were fresh and perfectly crisp, and the walnuts and sauce flawlessly complimented the shrimp.  there are more staples to our usual order:  your cashew chicken is a favorite.  we love all of the vegetables, the paper-thin slices of chicken, complemented by the cashews.   your sliced beef with ginger and green onion is delectably unique.  i particularly love the pieces of ginger peppered throughout this flavorful beef dish.    your braised string beans!  your eggplant with garlic sauce!  so good, every single time.  and i have thoroughly enjoyed the wide variety of soups you expertly prepare.  i am particularly partial to vegetables egg roll.    your place is simple, and clean.  a decorator wouldn't hurt, but that's not why i don't want to visit.    it's your family.  alas, many in your family don't like me.  i suspect that they don't like people, in general.    yes, i know the wait-staff is your family (are they your daughters?), because if they were not, you would have fired them ages ago.    i heard about them, before my first visit.  i decided that they weren't going to scare me off; i've been to enough authentic chinese restaurants to be tolerant of unpolished, non western-style wait service.  but your folks aren't a little rough around the edges; this isn't a cultural disconnect.    they are rude.  abrupt. surly.  in a ""they can't fire me, i'm family"" sort of way.  in a ""i hate my job"" sort of way.  i've had many treasured moments with them.  i've tried.  i'll spare you the details, they are your family, after all- but they aren't good for business.  someone should really explain to them the concept of ""tips"".    you do have a couple good waitstaff-  a more mature woman and gentleman are a welcome reprieve.  so, what rating should i give you?  5 definitely for the food, 1.5 for the service.  4 for now.  i'll continue with to-go orders.",-1
"thought from the looks of it, it'd be a fun place. not really. atmosphere is nice by sight, but nothing else much to it. servers don't seem to care much. it's more of a gay-friendly hang out. so, if you're wanting to take a heteor-date there, i'd opt for a dif place. the food was mediocre. won't try it again. left a bad taste in my mouth.",-1
"i'm upgrading it by one star because while they have a very limited selection what is available is of stellar quality and flavor. i can't give them a full five though because they use the worst spoons ever. seriously, they're so weak and flexible that you can't scoop your ice cream with them. what good is that? get some proper spoons and you may revel in your five star glory. until then, feel shame for your cheapness.",-1
"i would give this ""urban grocery"" a better rating if their hours were better!  being closed on sunday and monday, two of the most common ""oops, i forgot something and need to go to the grocery store"" days, is not the best idea.  it's great that this place is within walking distance of our home, but their stock just isn't that great.  i'm glad that i can get hickman's eggs there, but i wish that they used superstition farm milk instead of the ubiquitous shamrock.  superfarm's milk tastes better and lasts longer.  they have an interesting selection of produce, and i realize it's still growing, but we live in az so stuff like berries are not to be expected.  bummer.  they carry some stuff that i will purchase every so now and then like the az cheesecake co. treats and the bread from scottsdale, but that's about it.",-1
"da chicken. merciful heavens. i can't think of one thing i would have changed about the chicken i got from here.  the crust was crunchy,  crumbly, and tasted like golden nuggets (perfectly seasoned...and i mean perfectly)...and this is after a 30 minute drive home.  the meat was tender and juicy - even the breast.  and most of all, the flavor went through the whole piece of chicken, not just skin deep. everyone has their definition of what good fried chicken is.  this place has defined mine.  haven't had better chicken at any restaurant or even at anybody's table other than my grandmother's.  they got everything about it right. i forgot that i had two sides - cabbage and rice with gravy. the cabbage was decent, but i actually prefer cracker barrel's as it has more flavor.  the texture of mrs white's was better and it was chopped up in more presentable pieces.  but was lacking any wow.  still good, don't get me wrong.  my grandmother's cabbage has spoiled me; it's hard to satisfy me with this dish. the rice and gravy was a bit disappointing.  it was bland gravy over white rice.  i was hoping the gravy would be thick and creamy but it was instead quite thin.  not seasoned very much...  i wonder if this is the same gravy they use to smother stuff in?  i hope not. for dessert i got the banana pudding.  i have a cousin who i think makes the best bp in existence.  but, there's always someone better.  mrs. white's almost almost beat out my cousin's, but not quite.  i don't know how i can say that, seeing as how the whole little bowl was gone in 3 minutes:)  i guess that is a testament to my cuz's bp, because this stuff was awesome.  only complaint was that some of the bananas were too ripe, although some people like it that way? that's all for my meal.   i didn't even look at the receipt, hmmm...no clue how much it all cost me haha.  i didn't care.  i've been hearing about this place since i moved to az and actually swerved from the far right lane on jefferson into the parking lot, taking out several vehicles in doing so (j/k).   the place itself as others have said is pretty dumpy.  the best food is found in places of this status but as i was looking around i felt myself wishing that this specific place would get a face lift.  i don't know, its just that they are such a staple and well-known place...they could at least frame some of the memorabilia they have on the wall.  not dirty though, mind you.  the girl there was diligently mopping.  too much clutter by the register...personal items of the staff just laying around.  c'mon now.  represent what you serve, instead of allowing people to think that what they will get served may represent the look of the place.  a rinky dink liquor store that serves the best corned beef - they can look like a disaster, that's just fine.  but these guys are a soul food force in the area and i feel they could be even more with an update to their building. the folks that were working there were just fine to me.  an older man greeted the customers, gave instruction to the servers, and took my order.  he knew the regulars and greeted them enthusiastically.  i liked that.  furthermore, some guy came in needing change.  the man (hmmm i guess that's probably mr white???) gave him tips on where to park for cheap, gave him the money to park somewhere, and told him to hurry so he won't be late for his appointment.  :) :) :)  also shared a few observations about a woman on tv (let's make a deal).   no one was rude.  you read what the golden rule is and you'll see its enforced here.  do unto others... i saw a plate come out to a dine-in customer that was piled, and i mean piled with fried chicken smothered in gravy and with greens and something else on the side.  it looked ridiculously amazing.  i will go back.  i will try the porkchops, smothered this and that, and of course the catfish.  i'll also try some other sides, maybe the two i chose were their ho-hums anyway. i recommend trying their chicken at least once! oh and i saw someone on here mention their to-go order was skimpy...sorry bud but mines was 3 huge pieces that didn't even allow the box to close:)",-1
"i stopped in today on a whim after a trader joe's visit. i was impressed by how clean and organized it was inside! maybe all the construction that had been going on had me associating it with dirt, but there was none to be found!   due to a lunch hour time crunch, i automatically opted for the daily special- a boracho burrito and large drink. for 8 bucks i was impressed by the quality:  the chips were standard issue corn and the salsa was in a little squirt bottle that the cashier got out of a fridge behind the counter. it was blended instead of chunky-which i find muy bueno.  there were good sized chunks of tender beef in the burrito, a ton of cheese on top, extra sauce all over and generous dollops of guac and sour cream on the side. definitely a solid, inexpensive meal. i will hit it up again for sure.   *for some reason it got me thinking about one of my fave college days hangouts- two peso's! except they dont have a guy yelling ""two-feefty-four, nomber twofeeftyfour"" when your order is up. loved that. **that was totally irrelevant, but it felt good.",-1
"is there a better meal than breakfast? i think not... any so, we have sort of made it a weekly tradition to have breakfast at the place. my better half had eaten there prior to it moving to its new location, and i had never been there. she was not a fan of the previous location.   after looking at yelp and the 4 stars reviews, i talked her into trying it again. and we are huge fans!   it starts with mimosas and from there, it's breakfast bliss. the portions are huge, and the servers are friendly. good food, but no real maple syrup. so, we bring our own.   it's a good experience.",-1
"our la perla experience started off with the fear of being shot during the vatos altercation in the fiesta room that carried out into the parking lot. our debate to stay or not weighed heavily on the bogo coupon we had.  i ordered the chicken chimi ""regular"" size, the chicken was good but i didn't care for the red sauce they topped it with. the beans were very runny and the rice didn't have much flavor. my boyfriend ordered the carne asada plate, the meat was a little bland but otherwise ok. he also didn't like the beans. the food wasn't horrible but wasn't good either. sorry la perla, we won't be a return customer!",-1
"i don't really do the whole ""hang out at a coffeebar"" type thing, so my review is based only on the drink itself, which has been awesome every time i've been there.    best in the valley.   it's a shame central is such a pain.",-1
"it's hard to judge a restaurant based on a single visit with a large group, but service was so awful at this chompie's that there is no way i would ever make the drive to meet anyone at this location again.  a friend of mine was in town but only had limited time to meet up, so a group of about 15 people (plus three small children) decided to meet for lunch.  we did the smart things and called ahead to let them know that such a large party was planning to dine there at 1:30.  we were seated in a ""party room"" which had a tv, fireplace, and plenty of room, which was nice, but it also was dirty.  three tables had previous diners' dirty dishes and cutlery left on them.  the floor hadn't been swept.  and, one busser stopped in and cleaned off only one of those table during the two hours we were stuck in there.  so now for the real problem...  we were seated in this dirty room and after a few minutes a waiter came in.  we all ordered food and drinks.  it became very obvious the one server assigned to our group was overwhelmed.  it must have been at least 10 to 15 minutes before we started to see any of those drinks.  i don't know how long it takes to pour drinks for 15 people, but couldn't someone at least bring some pictures of water and glasses during that time?  drinks finally arrived.  then nothing.  it was an hour later when some pickles were brought to the table.  i'm not joking.  an hour later and our meals still weren't ready.  it was 2:30 in the afternoon.  i was planning on being at least getting ready to pay my bill by that time.  fortunately, none of the kids were complaining, but at least make sure they got their orders in a fair amount of time.  everyone was hungry.  neither the server nor the food were anywhere to be seen.  when our orders finally arrived at 3:00, the trays were placed on one the still dirty tables (a few of us noticed, but everyone was too hungry to complain).  the saving grace was that none of the orders were wrong.  the waiter was smart enough to bring free cookies with the bill, but the only reason none of us got a manger and complained was because it was nearly 3:30 and we all had places to go and just wanted to get out.  the one redeeming part of the visit is that the food is the same as every other chompie's.  which is excellent.  the ambiance is modern instead of old fashion deli.  but the service was a complete fail.  they knew a big group was coming, if they were unable to accommodate us, they should have warned us.",-1
"if you don't love it, you don't get it.  make an evening of the bianco's experience.  here's how:  when you arrive, walk inside and put your name on the wait list.  they will tell you an astonishing number like, ""your table will be ready in three hours.""  don't worry, waiting is just as fun as eating there.  proceed next door to the wine bar.  order an appetizer and a bottle of wine.  enjoy the company of your friends.  slow yourself down, relaaaaax.  order another bottle of wine.  at some point midway through this bottle your table will be ready, if you do it right.  i have never waited the actual time quoted by the hostess (or it didn't seem like it because i was having fun).  after a few glasses of wine, and the fun but hefty wait, your food will taste better than if you had gotten it instantly--  i promise.  after getting your table, continue to relax and enjoy yourself.  you waited for this table, and it is yours.  i recommend that you order at least one more pizza than you think you want, because you will want it, if not right then, at least later.  have another bottle of wine with your food.  here is what to order:  margherita - tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil   rosa - red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, az pistachios   biancoverde - fresh mozzarella, parmigiano reggiano, ricotta, arugula  +++ add crimini mushrooms   again, if you try it, and you don't like it, that says more about you than the place.  it is okay though!  bianco's is not for everyone.  walmart is for everyone, and look what that place is like!  the difference is, this restaurant is notpretentious.  the owner cooks the pizza right in front of you, while watching suns games with his cap on backwards.  if you don't think you can handle the wait, i have a simple solution:  go anywhere else.  excercise your freedom of choice!",-1
"in proper jamie fashion i'm making bosa my 60th review. fortunately for me i live less than 10 minutes from this place. if i were ruler of the world there would be 24 hour donut joints like this within walking distance in every community. their donuts are always fresh however, the full selection is not always available as they sell out quick. my favorites are the dozen donut holes for a $1, chocolate glaze, and sugar. the denseness of these donuts are spot on (gooey, chewy and airy all at the same time). sweet but not overly so. i've even had their breakfast croissant which consisted of ham, cheese, jalapeno. it was good but the main attraction here is the donut so don't go here expecting gourmet anything else. the coffee is okay nothing to rave about but decently pairs with donut.  beware of the service charge on your debit card if you don't spend at least $5. service can be spotty depending on who's working (the elderly woman is much more cordial than the teenagers that sometimes staff the restaurant). bosa is a great way to satisfy your fried dough cravings. ps- yes these donuts are better than dunkin and krispy kreme.",-1
"loved this place!   i ordered the fish and chips and they live up to the ""raves"" on yelp!  the batter was not at all over powering and gave just the right bit of crunch.  loved the hand cut fries as well...doused in some yummy malt vinegar and a big helping of some hard cider...i was happy!",-1
"one of the most relaxing places that's within biking distance from my house. i, am indeed, one lucky gal!   while it's not huge, the farm can keep me occupied for hours on end. i just love the serenity and beauty of it all, and taking time to breathe deeply and enjoy the little things in life.   the maya farm apparently has amazing csa shares i am going to buy into shortly that include flowers. i buy myself flowers every week, so this is a super fantastic deal :)  the little art shops and gardens are just beautiful and everyone is so nice and kind. i spent quite a bit of my stay there today playing with an adorable boston terrier.   downfall is the lack of good places i felt safe parking my bike. bonus is i just brought it with me (consider it my dog) wherever i traveled.   i will be back here... again.. and again.. it's a great weekend morning trip. i took some fantabulous photos today.",-1
"this place depresses me.  yes, they have made efforts to ""fix it up"", but it's really just a sad has-been.  if you need to run an errand to a very specific store, you'll be ok.  but this is not the mall where you want to slowly window shop.  if you head over here, it'll likely be for the costco, movie theatre (nice), or the supertarget.  warning:  unless you go before 10am, the walmart is frightful.",-1
"we heard fair trade cafe served vegan options and vegetarian lunch dishes, so we wanted to check it out. we aren't coffee drinkers - so this is only a food review.we rode our bikes over to fair trade on a sunday. i was really into the mood for a veggie sandwich, and voila! they had one on their menu.   i ordered the veggie panini. when it arrived, the bread was really oily and there were no condiments on the sandwich, at all! just bread and vegetables and a slice of cheese. they could have added anything to it: pesto, cream cheese, mustard -- nothing. the sandwich was $7 and came with chips (wish they had a healthier alternative for a side).   my boyfriend had the breakfast sandwich and said it was fair. his was only $4.    probably won't eat here again.",-1

"groupon ran a few specials to this place and i bought a few thinking $5 for a ticket and drink was a great deal...nope!  i love the dinner/movie theater concept, so i was excited when groupon ran their special and was looking forward to trying this place out. i love ipic and the new amc dinner theaters. but this place does it all wrong. horrible execution. horrible.  first of all, if you don't have ""reserved"" tickets, you need to show up at least an hour or two early to get a decent seat. shows are always sold out. theaters are too small and they block out 60% for ""reserved"" seating. should you find yourself with only the front row available with the rolling office chairs, (this has happened to me twice now), you can't upgrade your tickets to reserved seating at the box office. you have to purchase all new tickets through the kiosk or online for a $2 surcharge (a very annoying, anti-customer service move). a clever backhanded way of getting an extra $2 from the customers. that is bad business. by the way - the groupon tickets are not reserved seating.   when i complained to the manager, he said there was absolutely nothing he could do about the situation (really? nothing? what good are you as a manager if you have no power to remedy a customer's problem???). then he proceeded to condescendingly explain the whole ""reserved"" seating thing - yeah, i get it, i'm not an idiot. so i said i probably would not be returning because everything about the place was such a hassle. his response: that's fine if you don't come back.  rude. bad form.  i can't speak for the food because i didn't even get that far.  awful place. will not be returning.",-1

""it appears to be doing the backstroke sir.""   yep. this pretty much sums up our service at mb this past sunday. forgotten entrees. no ice bucket for the champagne. drinks took forever, if indeed, they were remembered. ketchup? our beniets? ugh!   formerly the foodbar (remember that place, with the awful layout and crazy ordering procedure?), mb is a lovely french restaurant in the heart of oldtown. we sat inside, luckily, as some gen x jewel type performer was on the patio ""singing"" and strumming her guitar. i heard just a few bars and wanted to stab my eye out with a hot fork. fortunately the hustle and bustle inside perfectly drowned it out!   the food was quite good. not incredible. beniets were undercooked a bit, but hey, we scarfed them down anyway. my eggs benedict was fantastic; served with biscuits instead of english muffins. but no potatoes. no salad. no nothing on the side. not even a garnish. others seemed pleased with a burger, granola and an all american breakfast.   christine is right however, in that we were there to celebrate a birthday. too bad much of our energy was used to flag down anyone who could help us. i swear i almost asked the lady sitting next to us to refill rickie's coffee. god that would have been fun!   so i can't say oui oui to mb quite yet. and for now i shall just say ta ta!",-1
what the hell?? we're regulars no more after our last visit.  thoroughly ignored by the wait staff and nary an apology.  we will not go back!,-1
"i went for dinner on friday night and remembered how much i love this place. the staff recognizes us and is really friendly and accommodating. the inside has been cleaned up a lot recently even though the shopping plaza itself is a little run down.  my faves are the spring rolls and bun. i tried the family style lemon grass chicken this time and it was fantastic! just spicy enough to give it a nice flavor, but not so much that you burn your tastebuds off.",-1
"i've been to kona a few times but have learned the best time to go is happy hour. the place is lively and the drinks are awesome! i would definitely recommend the chambord margarita. it is one of the best margaritas i have ever had!! and, for $4, it's pretty inexpensive. i also enjoy their sushi and appetizers.   kona is a nice place to go for drinks and a meal. i would recommend it.",-1
"we love angel sweet. here's why:  1. there's always plenty of parking. 2. the kids working there are nice. 3. they have the best peanut butter gelato i have ever eaten.  4. they don't limit you to the number of flavors you can get in a size, like some other places do.  so go ahead, try that super dark with the peanut butter and the cheesecake and fall in love with angel sweet. just be prepared to sit on the hard bench outside or take it to go--they have only three or four tables inside.",-1
"so, unfortunately, last time we ordered from boombozz, it was not good... maybe it was a bad night, but i have to update my thoughts to be honest.  the wheat crust was horrible! it was like cardboard. very flat & not at all pleasing to the palate. the portabella 1/2 of our pizza at least made up for flavor, but the fajita 1/2 was very plain tasting. we were very sad & marked it up to a new chef or something, but very discouraged to try again. we have liked it so much in the past, that we will be willing to go again, but after that experience, it isn't very high on our list.  they have digressed.  sorry.",-1
"i was sitting at my desk today bored to death.  i began to think ""what should i have for lunch today?"".  i am completely burnt out on fast food, burgers etc.   at that moment i remembered taste of italy.  i figured, that would be something different so i jumped in my truck and headed that way.    i arrived and walked in.  the owner recognized me and took my order right away.  i ordered a meatball sub and side salad.  he made the salad right then and off i went while they worked on the sub.  i think you might be hard pressed to find a fresher salad.  it was crispy and clean and had excellent flavor.  so, my sub was brought out about the time i was finished with my salad.  the roll was perfect, the cheese melted and the meatballs were very good.  the only problem is that my phone rang just as i took a bite.  so, what to do?  i now have a scorching hot meatball in my mouth and trying to talk on the phone at the same time.  the cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth and burnt, my eyes watered and i could not talk....   one slurp of diet coke and i was saved....   i am sure this has happened to all of you once in your life.     well, to wrap up my review, i had an awesome lunch and a good price.  clean surroundings and great service....     i think its as good as it gets!",-1
"update: shady's has some serious doorperson issues for a small lounge.  i was a regular here for a while since i am a big fan of the jukebox, cheap strong pours, super clean bathroom, lounge seating and some of the bar set up. i have had some good times here.   over the past year and a half, i have to say i have witnessed some serious attitude at the door, more than any club in scottsdale. one friend, a 5'4 red haired guy wearing a new kids on the block sleeveless shirt was denied admission, i finally hassled w/the bartender and gave me an extra shirt for him to wear since he was visiting out of town. it really soured everyones mood, i am sure the no sleeveless rule is intended for the wifebeaters the ""locals"" who may want a beer in hipster enclave may disturb.  i couldnt' convince anyone with me that night to go back, i was convinced it was a fluke.  but each time i went back, i felt a distinct bad feeling from the rude and dismissing door douches, the bartenders in general felt less friendly, the crowd more douchey and not fun to start casual conversations with at all, and all those annoying chairs just stitting in the middle of the bar starting to get on my nerves.  i went there recently with a co-worker, parents are from the caribbean, and were immediately met with hostility at the door. i was embarrassed at that point. we were ignored for a drink for a while, managed to find a seat and everyone pretty much stared at us. i felt terrible bringing my friend to what i realise is an exclusive, asshole drenched place and realized all my friends had been right before.  i really can't feel good about promoting this place anymore, the magic is definitely gone on how i feel about shady's-i still love the space, but that is it.",-1
the food has really gone downhill.  i used to go here all the time when i lived on that side of town but the last few times i've gone the sushi was horrible.  maybe it was an off day? i might venture back to see if this was the case.,-1
"i think this spot must have lost its mojo.  there are only a handful of flavors to choose from and none of them stood out.  all but two of those flavors were fat-free, but we'd never have know if we didn't ask.  you'd think it would be posted along with the flavor.  there's also a very serious lack of toppings at this location compared to some of the others.  i already hate that the yogurt is always soft at these self-serve yogurt places, but it was really bad at this mojo.  when my girlfriend pulled the lever for the chocolate it came out very soupy.  the girl at the counter told her that it always comes out that way.  if that's the case, the manager should probably look into getting that machine fixed.   on the plus side, the sample cups are left up front, so it's easy to test a flavor without having to ask.  the storefront is set up nicely considering it's so small.  if you're looking for something to satisfy your sweet tooth, and happen to be in city north, then mojo is an alright place to stop into.  but i wouldn't recommend going out of your way to eat at this mojo.",-1
"i really hate this branch of pita jungle.  i think this is due to the college-age hippie stoner slackers that dominate the staff.  i eat at the pita jungle in scottsdale often and love it - worthy of at least 4 stars.  the tempe branch - yikes.  bad bad sloooooooooooooooooooow service. maybe i am being overly harsh but my last experience here was so bad i actually walked out of the restaurant without eating my meal or paying.  after sitting there for over an hour, they managed to serve me the same cold plate of food twice (it was supposed to be hot).  and it wasn't  even that fact that i got served cold food twice that really ticked me off.  it was that no one there - not even the manager - seemed to give a shit.  unacceptable.",-1
"i was literally scared of going in here for a few months after it opened, because i know nothing about cheese and wine. the place is so small that i thought as soon as i walked in, i'd be sniffed out as an amateur and tables full of socialites would begin laughing at me as they stared through their monocles.   not at all! it is very friendly and unassuming. the staff is laid back and helpful, and they appear to have many great little plates on offer. my wife and i stopped in just for a glass of wine, and it was very nice.  i can't wait to go back and try some of their meat and cheese offerings--it looks like a great place to have a relaxed and quiet lunch.",-1
"still a fan because i love the beer selection, and the venue. but, i want to update because the gnocchi has gotten a little chef-boy-ardee-ish. not inedible but not as impressive as it once was...  so, i guess, i retract my love for the gnocchi but there's still a lot to love about this place!",-1
"found a very good chinese restaraunt in chandler of all places. my order consisted of beef pies, mongolian beef, tofu, & steamed dumplings. all were good......favorite would be the meat pies. the place itself is small so get here early for dinner as it gets packed in the weekend.",-1

"i finally joined this gym after weeks of agonizing over the monthly rates. i was having a hard time justifying the approx $80/mos fee. turns out, i didn't have to stress that hard since i got a decent rate already being a gold's gym member in the north scottsdale gym. because i was already a member, my new rate was $50/mos and even though my husband was not a member, he got that rate, too. that might seem like alot but the hot yoga classes were a major factor for me. even though they only offer one hot yoga class per week, they will be increasing the frequency due to the popularity. so, in my opinion, i am getting unlimited hot yoga per month for an added $25 to my existing gym membership. way, way worth it to me when i factor in bikram yoga's rates. there are a number of features to this gym that other reviews have already mentioned. they have individual spinning bikes that have individual screens allowing you to use a digital spin instructor. this is great if you can't make it to their live spin classes. all of the cardio machines have tvs that you can plug your headphones in. the employees actively seek suggestions to add machines they don't already have. members are also offered a workout towel and shower towel so you don't have to bring one. i like the option of the validated parking (2 hours). if i want to go to an event downtown, i can fit in a short workout, shower, and then leave my car in the garage for whatever time i have left in the garage. i'm not sure how busy the gym will get after awhile, but for now, i am enjoying the easy and quick access to any of the machines. lots of people-watching and nice views are to be had working out by the windows...you can't beat it.",-1
"walking into pcg on a recent sunday for brunch, i wasn't sure what to expect.  the place was pretty much empty.  coming off a few less than stellar recent brunch attempts at other local spots (why is it so hard to find good eggs benedict!?), i took this to be a less than favorable sign about the meal ahead...    well, i was wrong...  pcg served some of my favorite things!  a mimosa with fresh-squeezed oj started things off nicely.   :)   on to an appetizer - yes, even brunch deserves an appetizer!  i was happy to see jumbo bacon-wrapped shrimp on the menu.  now that wildfish no longer serves them, i have been hunting for a new favorite.  these were delicious - 4 large shrimp, stuffed with cojita cheese and wrapped in bacon - perfect with the accompanying chipotle-lime aioli.  and last, the main event.  the tenderloin eggs benedict was fantastic.  two english muffins graced with generous slices of medium-rare tenderloin, poached (not overdone - hooray!) eggs and tangy hollandaise.  this masterpiece came with diced breakfast potatoes (not greasy at all!) and a small bowl of fresh fruit.  yum!    thank you, pcg, for renewing my faith in brunch.",-1
"just returned from a great first time at four peaks. after much debate on what to drink, i enjoyed a nice, cold pint of the 8th street ale, along with the southwest burger. both ended up being excellent choices. the beer was tasty, and the burger was one of the best i'd had in a long time (fries weren't too shabby as well). service was pretty quick for how crowded it was. nice establishment.",-1
best fast food restaurant.  great service.  fresh food.  love the grilled cheese with grilled and raw onions and minimal sauce.  the fries are great when they are hot.  fresh brewed iced tea with fresh big chunks of lemon.  mmmm.... i could eat here everyday.,-1
"a few days after the abysmal experience i received an e-mail stating that some big shot was going to call me to discuss.  i have received no calls, nor will i.  if their management is as lackluster as their presentation and service, there will be no phone call.  its like they have given up.....",-1
"even though it is 30 miles away, i will be coming back to tesoro often.  the osso bucco alone is worth it.  succulent veal bathed in a light brown sauce sitting on top of parmesan risotto.  and did i mention the bone marrow?  seriously amazing.  one of the top 3 things i've ever eaten.  the osso bucco alone should merit 5 stars, but the soup was boring and the mozzarella was slightly cold.",-1
there happy hour is great!  1/2 off app's - everything on the app list is amazing - especially the shrimp and catfish taco's!  and they have the most amazing marg - it is made with chambord (sp?) and you are limited to only 3 b/c they are so damn strong!  wish the crowd was hipper - it seems to be a bunch of old folks - but that could be b/c we go some damn early!  service is always great - food is always good - and there berry cobler will rock your world!  i am going tonight and can't wait!,-1
"i'll probably be stoned to death and lose my pink card for this review, but i've given bliss a chance three times and was sorely disappointed all three. from inconsistent service, to snooze-inducing food choices, i just can't go into the rapturous food orgasms that many of my locals seem to have when eating here.  i haven't done the rebar side of the combo, so all i can speak of is the restaurant. i like the space, and sure the staff is cute (in a sort of frat-boy/porn star way), but i need good food with my eye candy.  things i have tried: 1) the chicken soft tacos -- no flavor and heavy on the purple cabbage. 2) loaded mac n cheese -- i prefer the mac n cheese at switch, hands down. 3) buffalo chicken sandwich -- decent taste, but a total mess to eat.",-1
"i've been wanting to try tuck shop for a while now and finally got the chance when my husband and i went there for dinner last weekend. unfortunately, they did not live up to my expectations. i liked the vibe of the place but i wouldn't really say it was as homey as people make it out to be. for example, i liked the mismatched wooden chairs but they should have put some cushions on them to make it more comfortable. you know the cloth padded kind that you tie onto the wood spindles on the back of the chair? just a suggestion. and it was pretty loud in there. they need some rugs or something to soften it up help with the noise level. the staff was friendly but it felt more like i was in a trendy bar rather than a restaurant famous for homestyle comfort food.  of course the most important thing is the food and on that score only one out of the three dishes was a winner. i ordered the pork tenderloin. this was suggested by our waitress as one of the best things on their menu and boy was she right. the pork was fully cooked but still juicy and tender. and there was a lot of it. even better was the sauce... sweet and fruity but not too syrupy. the menu said it was a ponzu sauce but it didn't have that umami flavor (which is good since i don't think that would go with pork). and i really enjoyed the spinach that was sautéed with green apples. you wouldn't think those two things would go together but all the flavors on the plate really married up beautifully. hubby got the special which was a ribeye. normally that is one of his favorite steaks but this one was pretty fatty and just didn't have a good flavor to the beef. he also didn't really care for the seasonings. and the only other thing on the plate was some sautéed onions, in spite of the fact that it was almost $30. we decided to order some dessert and went with the chocolate chip cheesecake. this was a mistake. it was pretty unappealing when it arrived looking sort of gelatinous and wiggly. it was served warm (like warmer than room temperature) but yet it didn't seem to be an ny style cheesecake that had been baked. actually what it tasted like was just butter and sugar whipped together and had started to melt. the crust was made from shortbread cookies rather than grahams and had a coconut taste to it that was very off-putting as well. even the ""chocolate ganache"" topping that the waitress had described to us was too thin and watery and tasted suspiciously like hershey's syrup. i can honestly say that it was the worst cheesecake i have ever eaten and that is including frozen store bought.  i might give them another chance at some point in the future but i just wasn't wowed by the food the way the other reviewers seem to be. sorry tuck shop.",-1
"went here for reverse happy hour with some friends.  never been a huge fan of ra considering i feel there are other better sushi restaurants around, but the majority wanted to go here so i went.  definitely good happy hour prices but still not all that great.  i ordered for the hubby and i:  the chicken wings, tootsie maki roll, ra-ukin shrimp and korean bbq short ribs.    i honestly don't have a lot to say about this place because there is nothing sticking out of my mind.  for all of that, my bill came to $33 including an 18% gratuity.",-1

"why is it so grainy?   are cookies that are mostly organic supposed to feel grainy? after skimming through the other reviews on here, maybe i just went on an off-day. it was halloween 2009 when i stopped in with a friend for a couple of cookies, and decided to take home a dozen other cookies, and another dozen cupcakes. i guess i should've tasted them before i decided to drop $40 on 2 dozen treats.   the service was nice, but it felt a little awkward. there wasn't a huge selection of cupcakes/cookies, so i told them i just wanted to do 3 types of each to make it 2 dozens for my boxes. i was with a friend i hadn't seen in a while, so while we were in conversation, the counter-servers interrupted us a few times to ask which cookies/cupcakes i wanted.   i thought the taste of the cookies and cupcakes was pretty good, but i just didn't understand the texture of the cookies. the cupcakes here were actually ""cup""cakes. i didn't like the little cups they cooked the treats in. they made it difficult to pry open the dessert to eat. i would have much rather prefer paper liners. i had so many, and was able to eat them through the week for breakfast, but i probably won't return.",-1
"i had the cajun last week with a giant 34oz cider..  the food was awesome.  pasties are typically pre-made, although by pre, i think they mean within the last 20-30 minutes..  mine was fresh out of the oven.  so delicious.  never eaten anything like it.  the service was great, everyone was very friendly.  i sat at the bar, so i got to watch the chef's preparing the next batch.  be sure to tip those guys too.   i'll be back soon, with company.  i have a few more pasties to try..",-1
"we've eaten here twice.  both on weekend, one for breakfast, one for lunch.  setting is great.  nice atmosphere.    service is fair.  friendly, but not overly attentive.  food is just okay.    here is the great thing about them for breakfast/lunch.  the $10 mimosa special is an entire bottle of champagne with a large caraffe of orange juice.  enough to get 3-4 people tipsy over breakfast.  $4 bloody mary was decent.  mac & cheese is tasty but nothing gourmet about it.   chicken sandwhich with bacon was just okay.  pretzel bun best part.  eggs are okay on the breakfast platter as well.  fries with grated parmesan cheese and red sauce dip is okay, but nothing special.  after two times, with all of the fantastic places to eat downtown, i probably won't be back.  seems like it's a better place to go to visit the bar than the restaurant.  when busy, with outdoor, it would be a terrific venue.",-1
"the good news is that they have negra modelo at 2 for $2.50 at happy hour, which has to be some kind of scottsdale record.  the bad news is that it's a mexican restaurant that seems to want to be a titty bar when it grows up.   the other reviewers aren't kidding when they say that every girl working here has implants.  big humongous ones.  not that there's anything wrong with that but it did confuse me on the concept somewhat. friendly servers though.  the food - at least what i had - was barely edible.  stick to the $1.25 beers.",-1
"i am tough on burger joints. my allegiance lies elsewhere...... but i seriously gave zinburger a 150% shot.   first of all, who wants to dine on a huge burger while staring a huge mural of a cow in the face? not me! makes me feel bad. probably a big reason i am a fan of chic'fil'a, eating chicken while staring at a cow, awesome! anyway..... the decor is cool enough, other than the giant cow watching you eat his cousin.   on to the food. $10-13 for a burger seems to be a standard these days for the upscale burger joints. so, it didn't really bother me. if it came with a side it would have been perfect. so the roommie and i want to get a good taste of everything so we shared a few options; the turkey burger, a glorified bacon/cheddar burger, double truffle fires, zucchini fries and a mint chocolate shake.   1.) turkey burger - probably the best i have ever had. perfectly cooked, great flavor and seasoning and the toppings were great. cabbage rather than lettuce is a genus idea!  2.) bacon/cheddar burger - meh.... could have gone without ever having this thing in my life. first of all we asked for it to be cooked medium and when it showed up the bun was a bloody mess, i would call that rare. the bacon and thousand island dressing battled to the death and neither won. way too over powering for such a dominating burger. over all, wouldn't order it again, ever!  3.) truffle fires - how do you f*** up truffle fries? it's damn near impossible. they were great. i could tell they were freshly cut and were served with an awesome aoli. get 'em!  4.) zucchini fries - blech! almost sent them back just to get them out of my face. looked awesome and tasted worse than original cheerios. the batter they are in sucks, is soaked up all the oil from the fryer, and were as soft as noodles. i tried to make myself eat 3 of them but couldn't take it anymore.  and finally...  5.) mint chocolate shake - it was okay, in the most generous way. way too much milk was added so within 5 minutes is had morphed into this sloppy-slushy-watered down concoction that bored me. flavor alone, great! but the texture, disappointing. i will stick with the diner, where they know how to do it right.   i have to say the staff was great. very friendly and were there to take care of any need we had. but for the food itself, i will only ever be back for my once every other month turkey burger craving.",-1
"dude, i am like lil' jon guest backin up usher with this place ""yeah, yeah, yeah!""  friends have been telling me this place is fantastic for months, but i think my imagination of this place hindered me...i imagined a dirty beige dining room with blue checkered table cloths, rickety wooden chairs, like, mom art on the wall, and cutesy crap with bad beer and hot pocket like ""treats"". some late times at time out led me talking to a lady who works there, who told me of the vegan pasty one calls 45 minutes ahead of time. at 2am, with some amber bock, oh man, i was stoked. i woke up the next morning, counting down the hours till i could dial that number for the vegan goodie. she recognized my voice, and i didnt have internet, so she was sweet enough to list the ingredients-i ended up getting eggplant and a bunch of other veggies.   my companion picked me up, and its on the hardy side of the university and hardy, fyi. we walked into a long, kind of dark hallway with small two seaters on the right and a bar on the left. dude...were we in the right place? this place was sleek-black and white decor, clean, hip, i mean, like urban chic man, but not pretentious. since it wasn't too buzy, we did the two-seater and she took our beer order (yummy beer selection-we did miss the happy hour at 5pm, but the prices were still fine), and ran into some friends.   the real star of this story is really the pasty-i learned i could add some quorn (the best meat substitute eva), but that was ok. my food with some sauce was amazingly comforting. not overly spiced, not overly cooked, loved the taters in it, i mean, there was nothing wrong with it-nothing. like a shephards pie, or a pot pie, or a calzone, who doesn't love a warm fold...? yeah? yeah? this is the bomb. and even though i was starving, i could barely finish it, but i felt perfectly content aftewards and not overstuffed at all.   i even have their sticker on my cell phone to advertise my love for this place-yeah, you heard right. i fucking blinged my cellie with cornish pasty!",-1
"proof that quantity doesn't trump quality, no matter how good the deal is.  $20 for all you can eat sushi is an impossible deal to pass up.  but take my advice and spend an extra $10 to $20 somewhere else, eat less, and be happier.  the rolls at mido are infused with much more rice than necessary for the consumer, but just enough that the restaurant saves money on the expensive protein and fills up the customer faster.  the fish is also not every good quality.  want to avoid the rice?  you can get a massive sashimi starter if you ask.  don't.  it is the worst pieces of fish i've ever had.  also mind boggling are the rolls that are on the regular menu that are not on the $20 deal.  many of them are cheaper than the al a carte orders of what's on the all you can eat menu, but for some reason, they won't let you have these without the up charge.  probably because they looked tastier than what's actually served.  having said all that, i really wasn't surprised.  what was i expecting when i was paying so little?  but what really got me down was the service.  the staff is friendly, but horribly disorganized.  i was with a group of 11 and we ordered on three separate tickets.  we figured that they would bring our orders on plates that coordinated with those tickets.  we figured wrong.  they brought everything out on big boats with little rhyme or reason as to what was placed on what tray  with some confusion, we had to ask or just taste in order to figure which roll was what.  we then explained to the server that some in our group had dietary restrictions so it was important for our next round of orders that we got we ordered on the ticket we ordered with, so that someone didn't accidentally eat something they shouldn't.  the server seemed fine with that, but when we made our second order, they once again just made a big mishmash out of it.  thanks for listening to a simple request.  one thing that was pretty fun about mido was the music and lights that play when there was a birthday.  once i finally figured out what was going on, it was a lot of fun.  way better than an annoying birthday song by the staff.",-1

"went here for dinner over the weekend with husband.  i kinda know what to expect from this place but felt like a sit down mexican restaurant and was in the neighborhood.  vibe is kinda like on the boarder, minus the tex mex part....right away we were seated to our booth, booth for two people was a little awkward.  it's a half moon shape but our view was looking out onto a huge party of over 20 people, not very chill feeling.  i ordered a large house margarita on the rocks and a mexican pizza.  food took awhile to get to the table, we were already on our second basket of chips before our food arrived.  pizza was ok, seemed like they skimped out on a lot of the toppings.  margarita was weak also.  i usually get a little buzz going on when i order a large one, but i didn't get anything from that one.  as always the food at macayo's seems to all drop to the bottom of your stomach like a rock....i think it's time to try something else even if i'm in the neighborhood.",-1
"i'd been eying total wine since their grand opening in july, and even more excited to go once i read brian s's review... i finally had a reason to go check it out - i was on a mission... a mission for prickly pear margarita ingredients!  this store is much bigger than it appears on the outside.  i walked in and didn't know where to start - but after getting my bearings, i realized that each isle was well-marked and there were tw employees all around asking if i needed help.  i found my way to the tequila isle which happened to be the same isle as mixers, but no  prickly pear juice or tequila was to be found.  i asked an employee and she took me right to the closest product they had - arizona high spirits prickly pear vodka.  even better for me since i'm more a vodka drinker than tequila!  andrea (the employee that helped me) was extremely helpful and took another step to take me to the az high spirits prickly pear vodka website where they have several recipes listed to make specialty drinks.  andrea also told me that tw does all kinds of tastings at the store, so i'll have to check those out sometime.  i can't wait to try the prickly pear vodka recipes soon.  more importantly, tw was a pleasant surprise and i will not hesitate to return for my beer, wine, and spirits needs!",-1
"good food and wine = yay!  no parking = boo!  all in all, a nice place to visit on a week night.  i hear the happy hour is awesome, but i have never been during the happy hour time frame.",-1
"both food and service have suffered since the last time me and my buddies visited.  i think the staff is working too hard at socializing with the patrons.  and by patrons i mean the group of college guys in the next booth over.  ok, look - we were not jealous...all of us in my group are happily married and don't need the attention from ""barbie"" the waitress...(not here real name but now you know what i mean right?)  we really just wanted food & beer but apparently this place ""turns into a club"" at 10pm which makes me feel like ""you need to leave now""....    a well deserved two star review.  enjoy your party at da club.",-1
"i've been to genghis three or four times now, and each time it was delicious.    i feel i have to address a couple of the reviews that have been posted here.  first, there is nadia's odd review about how ""gross"" for raw meat to be bloody.  well, last time i checked, meat has blood.  apparently she prefers frozen meat over fresh meat.  to each her own, but it seems a bit absurd.  second, jennifer ""reviewed"" the place without having actually eaten there, which strikes me as a bit closed minded and presumptuous.  i don't have the intuition to be able to judge a restaurant based on bowl size alone, but maybe she is just more talented than i.  on to the actual review... genghis grill is great.  like i said, the meat is fresh, and there are several options: steak, chicken, turkey, pork, sausage, scallops, shrimp, cod, calamari, and probably some that i'm forgetting.  oh, and did i mention that none of it is frozen?  after the meat, you are hit with a wide array of seasoning selections (ashley mentioned that she would prefer sauces.  apparently she didn't realize that there are also sauces at the end.).  seasonings are necessary because they enhance the flavor, which is something that yc's could use.  my favorite is the cajun seasoning.  next you hit a wide variety of vegetables and other knicknacks.  there are almost too many choices; i have a hard time narrowing them down.  it also allows for different combinations; not all of your bowls have to be exactly the same each time.  finally, you get to the sauces.  these sauces actually have flavor.    you also get a choice of what you want in the bowl with the stir fry; options include noodles and fried rice.    they also have strawberry lemonade, one of the rare restaurants with such an offering.  it is true that this place costs a little more than yc's, but it's worth it.  to those who say the bowl is small, sure, it's smaller than yc's, but when you add the rice or noodles, it fills you up, and you are limited at yc's by how much crap food you can stand to stomach.  there might be better mongolian bbqs which i don't know about, but this place is legit.",-1
"way too expensive! almost $3.50 for a tiny little cupcake. the vanilla has a strange flavor to it, and the chocolate isn't very good.sorry, i'm not a fan. i'll stick to my local favorite, sugarlips bakery.",-1
"oh, stingray... i have such a love/hate relationship with this place.  i *love* their happy hour: monday through friday from 3pm - 7pm. everything is dirt cheap. you could get a couple rolls and sake bombers and edamame for under $15. i love the decor/style of the place - very la.ny.sanfran'ish.   however, what good is a happy hour and restaurant fashion if the sushi is sub-par and the service is slow? this is where they lost me. the waitresses are pleasant, but it takes forever to get your food, check, water, etc.... and the restaurant won't even be slammed with customers. you can get over that, though. what you won't be able to get over is the taste/flavor of the sushi. it arrives extremely fresh, but it tastes like cardboard. i've tried almost all of them and the only one that is worth ordering is the philly roll - what does that tell you about the place? the miso soup... i love miso soup. i've never had a bad serving of it until i came here, and asked for them to take it back.   speaking of miso soup - if you sit by the bar, you'll get a complimentary bowl of it and a plate of edamame.   so, all in all - going to stingray definitely depends on your sushi standards. if you don't mind lackluster sushi and love cheap happy hour, go here. if you're a sushi snob (like myself) then spare yourself and go anywhere else.",-1
"review is for dinner/weekend - for mid-week lunch, price points and food seem good.  i live downtown, so i love new restaurants.  there are three thai restaurants within 3 walking blocks of where i live, and this is one of them.  it's frustrating that the jack up their prices so much for evening/weekend food, then complain when they are dead on the weekend.  hello!  it's downtown.  if you want to stay busy on the weekend, you should at least offer the same deals on the weekend, if not actually offer cheaper prices.  $10 bucks for minced chicken and stir fried veggies.  ordered basil plate, hot.  was medium spice at best.  i finished my plate.  it wasn't terrible.  it wasn't terribly expensive either, of course.   service was okay.  only patron at restaurant at 12pm.  i just won't be back.  i think it's the lesser of the 3 downtown thai restaurants.    again, for weekday lunch, i might very well have different review, given the value it represents with a bowl of soup, etc.  but for the price, quantity, taste... i'll frequent other restaurants first.",-1
"my parents love this place. they ranted and raved about how great it was so when my mom invited me to go there for a girls night, i was happy to try it out.  the restaurant itself is gorgeous. fake trees covered in lights...the whole nine yards. i hear they have live music on the weekends. the stage was beautiful.  everything was pretty expensive but i don't mind spending $15 on a meal if it's worth it. i ordered the vegetarian enchiladas and a margarita.   the margarita was alright. nothing too special. definitely not a twelve dollar margarita. as for the food, well it was horrible. my enchilada had cinnamon on it. cinnamon. it didn't say that it would have cinnamon on the menu. i hate cinnamon. i was really polite about it when i mentioned it to the waitress and she said, ""well authentic mexican food usually has cinnamon on the main dishes.""  excuse me? my last name is montoya and i was running around in diapers eating fresh tortillas before this waitress was even born. my family visits mexico multiple times a year and i was raised on homemade mexican food. not once ever has there been cinnamon in it. i wouldn't have been mad about the cinnamon if she hadn't said that. it is not authentic mexican food. i have no idea what she was thinking.  if you like overpriced 'mexican' food that tastes nothing like mexican food and love dessert spices on your enchiladas, then i'd suggest coming here!  stick to the bar for the atmosphere because it's lovely but avoid the food at all costs.",-1
i really don't think i'm the target audience for a place like this.  i understand what they're going for with these artisan pizzas but i really would just like a little sauce on my pizza.  just a little...  the flavors are usually good but the lack of any sauce and more often than not over cooked dough make it hard for me to want to keep coming back to places like this.,-1
"this restaurant really does it right!  really good food and great service!  we started with the beet salad and just had to try a small tomato soup, both of which were absolutely delicious!  we also split the hummus, which was probably one of the best hummus dips i've ever had.  then we shared the crispy eggplant sandwich and it did not disappoint one bit.      we totally enjoyed our whole experience at phoenix city grille.  the service couldn't have been any better.  the gal was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  i highly recommend this restaurant and i can't wait to return to try other items on their menu.",-1
"decided to go here on a whim because they have a clever name.  turns out that's really all they have going for them, besides the cold beer.  the food was forgettable, the atmosphere was bleh the service was slow and the decor was like a failed attempt at applebee's.  needless to say, i won't be going back any time soon.",-1

i expected soooo much more! i am almost heart broken...kind of.  the meat lovers scramble was to die for...so why only 2 stars? the amount of food given i could have gotten double at my favorite breakfast spot for the price paid. they scramble maybe like 1 or 2 eggs and throw in some meat but it just did not seem like a reasonable price for how little was on my plate and i paid extra for a slice of french toast. if i would have known that the french toast wasn't as amazing as some people make it to be they do not know mouth watering french toast like i do. if you are craving french toast go to crackers and co. not scramble!  if i go to scramble again i would stick with the toast and potatoes with the scramble but i might try something else next time.  then update my review. but for now i am sticking with the two stars for the taste of the meat lovers scramble.  i love how many hot sauces they had so it will give me more to experiment with next time.  their rosemary potatoes are so much better than wildflower bread company whose are way too salty for my taste.    service was decent even though its not a real sit down place where people constantly check to see how you are doing. so service in general too me wasn't anything out of this world over the top status.  the place itself was clean and comfortable. but not for a long period of time. :) until then i wasn't so disappointed that i will never go again i am just not fond of how little food you get or think you will get for how much you spend. for $8 you get mostly bread and potatoes. awesome right?  :|   :\,-1
"home of the nicest women's bathroom (thus best seat in the house) in existence!  seriously.  check it out. ladies. go to the bathroom here. you will find wallpaper, a chaise posh lounge, large quality framed reproductions, marble sinks, a place i have actually sat down to business, as well as to regroup. you may think i am nuts for this, but it is totally true. especially when riding my bike from tempe to mesa, coming in to wash my hands and drink some water from the fountain to refresh. *hobos stay out*  other than that... i totally heart bookmans. i really respect the manager here (it was her idea for the b-room, gurls!) for the great staff, and well organized selection. is it a bit disarrayed and full of bizarre (sometimes hideous circa 1997 stationary?) knick-knackery? yeah. but go to any bookstore and there is always disarray-always piles, things misshelved. you try to shelve some books and fend off customers at the same time in a place as buzzed as this!   i mostly go for random browsing (graphic novels, art, pop culture, cookbooks, business, children's books, sociology) for works that may be discontinued, but i really come here for magazines. i love they sell magazines! magazines are my guilty pleasure b/c they are so expensive! sure, i can rent some mags from the library, but will they have the punk planet issue w/found magazine in it? hellll no! for most, ranges from 1.50-4.00. i get back issues of domino, dwell, fast company, believer, wired, readymade...and my real guilty pleasure, real simple. you cant really beat it for quality airplane reading, plus at those prices you can leave it for someone else to enjoy.  also, bookmans is really part of the community-they sponsor a lot of events, like rollerderby, the loft events in tucson, midnite movie mamacita, and more...  their booktrading is pretty fair, but if you have some items that are worth more than half of their cover price and they aren't rare, you may be better on-line. be sure to take your books back to donate them (and tax refund) b/c rarely do they take all of them-and don't hassle or argue w/the booktrader-just not classy.  oh, and i like the hot new used books to check out in the front!  if only a good coffee shop could open up inside...",-1
tried this place for the first time today after reading the yelp reviews on burgers and i think it was even better than i had expected. the california burger was awesome and i loved the fries. to top it all off i had a dublin dr. pepper to was it down.  was the best burger shop hamburger i have had in years.   the have a soda shop also where you can pick out gourmet sodas with a really big selection.   service was fast and very friendly. i will definitely be back again when i am in the area.,-1
"i haven't reviewed the windsor yet? shame on me!  before you enter, be very careful where you park. pay attention to the signs in the residential streets, you will get ticketed. i almost always valet as i am impatient and lazy.  the architecture is similar to postinos, it has that old- wood-modern-minimal-rustic-charm feeling. the patio outside rocks, if weather allows sit outside.   the food is wonderful. my favorite is the bahn mi fish sandwich, second favorite is the ribs, and of course the 5000 calorie porkwich is also delectable. the vegetable chop and mixed grain salads are wonderful and so is the burger (order it windsor style, trust me)..   the bartenders are friendly, the drinks are stiff and the wine list is hefty. this has become one of my cen pho favorite spots.",-1
"i finally had the opportunity to try this place.  the atmosphere is fabulous...love the decor which feels sort of chic, elegant yet understated with a great mix of colors and textures...i'm very aesthetic and a beautifully decorated restuarant ususally enhances my reviews :)  we were seated in the far back room which was nice, comfortable, well lit and very quiet.  i was immediately impressed with the lunch menu which felt very comprehensive and certainly not overpriced whatsoever.  i opted for the curry chicken salad ($11) which includes field greens, chicken breast, sliced almonds and golden raisens with a two dressing combination of creamy curry and a red wine vinagarette which i ordered on the side.  i ate every last bite of the salad.  she ordered the heirloom beet salad ($11) which was a very nice presentation.  the focaccia bread with pesto dipping sauce edged my carb craving.  oh, i can't forget the fabulous black iced tea (with a hint of tropical flavor) which was just delicious.    the service was extremely friendly and attentive...absolutely no complaints whatsoever.  it was an extremely nice dining experience and i'm looking forward to returning soon.",-1
"sweeeeet!  don't you just love it when you have had a place bookmarked for so long that you almost forgot about it, and when you finally go it's amazing?  yeah, that's what happened here.  we had been doing a little shopping out in this part of town and were starting to get hungry so we started searching for places to go.  the husband mentioned this place and i was quite enthusiastic and mentioned i have had it bookmarked for so long.    we made our way over to the cute little store with it's big glass front and cool brick interior.  there's lots of cool music oriented art around and the tables are covered in graffiti.  again, it's a pretty sweet place, aside from the lack of air circulation.  we stared at the gigantic chalkboard menu for a while (despite being chalkboard it's pretty easy to read) and finally made our selections.  i got the stromboli and the husband went with the meatball calzone.  the guy making our stuff was really cool and helpful.  the best part was that he really seemed to love his job.  you gotta love that.  when our food came out, the smell was intoxicating.  i dug right in and relished in the delicious garlicky dough and the sweet yet tangy sauce.  the ham was perfect and sweet and the pepperoni were meaty and spicy.  i tell ya, this stromboli was glorious.  it was glorious and huge!  i had to take half of it home, and yes, the leftovers were just as good.  i have a feeling that anytime i find myself in this neighborhood i am going to start salivating for the delicious goods here.  you should go.  you should also tell all your friends to go.  a place like this is too good to keep secret.",-1
"it's just not worth it to go here. the service is a hit or miss - some waitresses are helpful; some are bimbos. the food isn't that great... you can definitely find better. the inside setup... well, we had to sit outside because of it. i wouldn't go back.",-1
"not the best sushi in the world but i appreciate the value of their lunch specials as well as the charm, panache and mystique of the bartenders.   tip - they also make a fantastic squid salad.",-1
"la condesa is an amazing little spot that has more than food, but charm as well. i really enjoyed the way that the restaurant was decorated; it definitely creates its own vibe, and it's not painted with a lot of loud colors (there are a ton of pictures of the decor if you look at the pictures). it's very classy to say the least.  the salsa bar is the first thing that i have to mention. it was overflowing with variety and flavor. every time that i thought i'd found one that i liked, i tried another and pushed the previous aside. my girlfriend and i managed to polish of two baskets of chips without a problem or remorse because we had to try every salsa. the tamatillo and cilantro were two of my favorites in the mix.   we also ordered the mayan conchinita pibil tacos and the aztec tinga tacos. i'm usually hesitant about chicken on tacos because i usually always have bad experiences, but not here! the tinga taco was great. the meat was tender and well marinated - i could taste the sauce in every bite. the conchinita though is what really won me over. the pork was so good! imagine the tenderness and juiciness or your favorite bbq pork sandwich, but replace the flavor with a bevy of delicious mexican spices and we'll pretty much be on the same level.  i'm pretty baffled that i didn't see a lot of my yelp friends raving about this place. as a result, i will send this review out to you all (go try it =) ). this is a great little place that isn't pricey yet brings great flavor. the next time i got there i will be getting a quesa, no question, and hopefully i will be going back very soon.",-1
"5 stars for the taste of the food.  2 stars for service.  yikes.  i'm allergic to peanuts.  i told the lady server this from the get-go, and she confidently stated she'd let the kitchen know and assured that no peanuts would reach the table.  of the 8 dishes we ordered, 7 were brought to the table garnished with peanuts.  7!  each time, the server would apologize and blame it on the kitchen.    i would be inclined to believe her, if it weren't for the crap service she provided otherwise.   we constantly had empty drinks, and at one point, during a particularly spicy dish, we ended up having to flag her down out of desperation.  the food did taste great though.  too bad i'll never come back because of the service/peanut concerns.",-1
"this place is a bit hard to find in the dark if you've never been. i ended up at the library but it's down the street a bit, tucked off the main street.   this place definitely caters to the 'hipster' crowd with a heavy dose of pretentiousness but i've come to expect that from more popular local coffee places. the interior is very modern (though not well-maintained). we came in right before closing so it wasn't busy at all but they still had plenty of baked items in the case. the barista that made our coffees was very nice when my mother asked what ristretto meant (how they make all their coffee drinks, as advertised on the menu) but the other barista seemed very aloof and non-engaging.   my overpriced small mocha would have been a lot better if they didn't use dark chocolate but that's all they had. is it more hip to use dark chocolate now? i'm a huge fan and frequenter of dutch bros. and if you can't compete flavour-wise with a drive-thru coffee place, it's probably time to re-evaluate.  seems like a good spot to hang out if you live in the area (and can find parking) but i would definitely not come back when there are better options in the same area.",-1
"there are so many reasons this place is a failure, even though i am so so thankful for the existence (though not the idiotic design and planning) of the amc 24 here.  full of 2nd-rate restaurants and trinket shops, it just doesn't have much draw.  (sam's cafe is really the only restaurant here that i go to much.)  rather than putting the theater (blank walls) in the center with the shops and restaurants around it to create a vibrant urban space, they killed the street-facing ability of much of this block by turning it outside-in and into a little suburban ""enter me and leave the city"" area.   you combine that with the concept of 2nd floor retail (again a suburban mall concept), and this place is a complete failure.  notice nothing exists on the 2nd floor.  even if it had 3x the foot-traffic nothing could survive up there, because no one would ever see anything on a 2nd floor in-passing on their way to something else and thereby never ""discover"" it.  whoever conceived and built this ""center"" should be tarred, feathered, and forced to live in anthem.  actually, judging by the design, they probably do live in anthem.",-1
"i am so happy the snow craze has finally made it to arizona! i have had snow at a couple places in california, so when this opened we knew it was a must try! i knew it would be successful in phoenix, well...because it get so damn hot! we came here opening week and got there at the perfect time because after we got our order the line got crazy and went out the door! i recommend everything! my favorite is mango, taro  flavored snow with the mango popper thingys! we even tried to black sesame syrup, that i'll admit i doubted, but it was really good! this is close to my sisters house so i hope to come back again when we're in the area.",-1
"ok we got to this place 15 mins and they didn't open till 11am they opened early to let us out of the 100+ heat, nice guys :) we went inside to a very pleasing to the eyes burger shop. i was blown away by their soda machines with touch screen, very futuristic. the cup was fries was enough for 2 people and the burgers were large, juicy, fresh, and full of flavor. they would be a 5 stars if their prices were 1 dollar less. but overall i would gladly return very good food.",-1
"i've been waiting for this place to open with super high hopes, and it looks like it will live up to expectations.  bliss:  as dave b said, we were only able to try a couple of appetizers, but they were delicious.  the coconut chicken is in a plum sauce, and was divine.  a full order of it would make a perfect meal, and at $7 isn't bad at all.  almost all of the appetizers looked just as good.  the menu isn't terribly huge, which seems to be a growing trend.  everything sounds good though; there are a few salads, two burgers, two mac and cheese options, and a couple of other entrees.  they all fell in the $8-$13(ish) range.    finally, there are a couple of great looking desserts, and a saturday and sunday brunch of french toast, eggs, and the usual.  the place itself is such a great space... the majority of seating is outdoors on the patio, and indoors it's a very clean and modern feel but still bright and sunshiny.  as for the rebar side, i really think it's going to be a hit.  the patio is one of the best views and best looking places downtown, and i'm guessing the inside bar will be the hot new place very soon.  it's got all the coolness of the roosevelt, plus hard liquor in addition to beer and wine.  there were no tables or chairs yet, so i'm not sure what the vibe will be... it looks like it could be a low-lit swanky place with loud music and dancing, or it could turn into a more casual and comfortable hangout.  either way, it looks like it's going to be just what i was hoping for... they'll have their own parking lot soon, so cross your fingers for bliss/rebar to become a destination restaurant of the sort we desperately need downtown.",-1
"i am one of those people that talk crap about gordon biersch behind its back but i'm nice to its face. i go there and continue having expensive yet mediocre meals, but like i just said- i go there. my boyfriend asked me once ""why do it to yourself when you don't enjoy it? "" i don't know. maybe i'm a masochistic eater. actually, i'm just very agreeable and i work super closeby. and if i didn't go there i would just walk over to whole foods and spend a zillion dollars on a goulash-y takeout container that i don't even like after i pay for it. for me, lunch is more about getting out and doing something else for an hour a day. if someone wants to go to gb i will happily tag along and probably eat, even though i know i wont like it. at least there's not much harm in that, except to my wallett! ps- lori is the nicest, sweetest server/bartender ever and chatting with her makes up for the crappy food!",-1
"if i were an undergraduate at asu and/or under the age of 21, i would probably love tempe marketplace. it's got a lot of stores that those groups would love to shop in...gap, buckle, pac sun, old navy and charlotte russe just to name a few.  plus there are a lot of restaurants and places to eat, which would be appealing i suppose.  the only reason i go to tempe marketplace is for target and best buy because they are the closest to my house.  we tried the movie theatre over there last night...big mistake. not only were there tons of teeny-boppers just walking around and ""hanging out"" (remember when you went to the mall and movie theatre in middle school and high school just to hang out?? god, i can't believe i ever did that), but parking was horrible, as it is ever time i go to the marketplace.  lastly, i don't find tempe marketplace walkable for such an ""outdoor destination"". old navy, pier 1, target, famous footwear are over here and the movie theater, restaurants, and mall type stores are way over there. it is way too spread out to just park once and then walk everywhere you might want to go.",-1
"i've ate at osf twice now and it was two times too many. both times service has been horrible. i get that working the lunch shift may not be lucrative, but yesterday i was with a group of approximately 15 and our waiter was incredibly rude and disinterested in serving us. he was banking on the fact that he would get an automatic 18% from each of us, which is unfortunate because for good service i will tip more. beyond the lousy service, the food is not good. i had the fettucini alfredo the first time i ate at osf and it was drowning in alfredo sauce...yuck. the salad looks like something you get from a bag. yesterday i ordered a caesar salad as my entree. first, it had tomatoes in it. i really don't like tomatoes in caesar salad. second, our waiter brought it out with the other salads. so that meant that when my group got their entrees, i had nothing and basically had to watch them eat. since when were entree salads brought out with starter salads??? lastly the wine selection is pathetic. there are only two white wines by the glass and the riesling i had yesterday was much too sweet.   for generic italian food, go to the olive garden. at least their salad and breadsticks are decent.",-1
"attended two conferences here and have been amazed by the property's facilities, food, and service.  the staff here is top notch and goes over the top to make you feel at home and special.  i asked about the sculpture on the golf course and they brought me a pamphlet explaining the origin of the sculpture, the artist, and the property.  the food we were served for lunch & dinner at the conference was amazing too......filet & mashed potatoes for dinner and cold cut sandwiches for lunch.  the food was quality and fresh.  the servers knew how to deliver and pick up the dishes without making too much noise as to distract us from the keynote speakers......you don't find that skill too often anymore.  overall, it's a great place to organize/attend a meeting.  plan to return for a vacation.  return factor - 100%",-1
"jade palace on pinnacle peak in north scottsdale was my ""go-to"" chinese place for years... so when i moved to old town, i felt a bit lost and haven't been able to find consistent chinese nearby ever since.  i've recently found a few options in phoenix, but after a recent take-out experience with friends and last night's meal dining in at this jp location, i think i may become a regular!  we met my parents for dinner here, and everyone was pleased with the meal.  service was spot-on, atmosphere was fine, drinks were cold and refilled often (the beers even came with chilled glasses), and most important, the food was fabulous!  i took charge of the food order for our party of four but allowed everyone to chime in of course.  here's what we had:  appetizers:  *1 large order new york egg rolls (2 total egg rolls but we had them cut in half so each of us had a half... delicious!) *1 large order bbq spare ribs (8 per order)  entrees: *lo mein noodles with shrimp and (extra) broccoli *dry sauteed string beans (1 small order) *house specialty #9 (kung pao three delicacies) - sea scallops, jumbo prawns, and sliced flank steak in kung pao sauce *mu shu chicken   of course, this was all served with plenty of white rice as well.  we ate almost everything, and the only negative i can say is that unfortunately, we didn't have leftovers to take home!    another perk for this location? sweet republic is in the same shopping center, so if you save room, head over there for dessert!",-1
"how can i politely say that all this place has is ""chick food.""   i have been here several times, and tried their limited vegetarian options. i found that the one with the mos flavor was the grilled feta. the feta gave it a nice flavor however the basil was lacking as were the tomatoes. it was original to use a fresh cheese like feta for a grilled cheese.  the meal includes chips and a side. i usually go for th pasta salad as it is the most filling. the flavor of the salad is bland and i usually empty half of a pepper shaker into it.   i have tried to spice up my food with the italian dressing that is found on each table. i found it best to turn the bottle upside down and let the oil separate out, this way you can get just spices and vinegar, it goes well on the chips.   overall the meals here are a bit pricey for the lack of flavor and portions.",-1
"okay - i've been going here fairly regularly and i've upgraded this to a 5 star place. the food is awesome and the people here are rad. it's one of my new favorites. i don't know what i was thinking giving it a 4. i'm stupid.  this place ranges from quite busy to comfortably laid back as it turns out. it's always an easy place to go though.   as for the pronunciation, i used to say it like ""frasier's"" instead of like it's spelled and then for some reason started saying it like it's spelled for the last few months. tonight i asked the owner and he confirmed it was pronounced like frasier's. i feel stupid yet again, but at least i've been sending people there.",-1
"love love love the bean & cheese burritos! just made a phone order for pick up to try it ""with sauce"" per most yelpers recommendations... can't wait! fish tacos are good. tacos are street taco size, and they pack a lot of flavor- delish. the place is not special but the food is =)",-1
"i brought the family here on a saturday for a nice breakfast and was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful the food was. i had just a basic breakfast of eggs, sausage, and potatoes. all was cooked perfectly and i really enjoyed their potatoes, they were very tasty & reminded me of my own yummy potatoes. i also got a side order of the biscuits & chorizo gravy to split with my son & husband. ooh my ....it was perfect, this is a must try. the chorizo gravy is not on the menu, you have to ask for it. my son had the burger and it came out huge, according to him, it was all that a diner burger should be. the husband had the chorizo scramble w/potatoes and a side of french toast, and again, all yummy.  i really enjoyed the diner atmosphere and noticed while sitting there that there were a lot of regulars, i even noticed that people could bring in their own coffee cup and keep it there...love that kinda place!!   the service was great! we were well taken care of from start to finish. i will definitely be back and suggest you check it out too.  oh...almost forgot. this place is very affordable. for example, the side of biscuits and gravy was $2.99, and my breakfast was $6.99.",-1
i have been to this place twice now and although there were some items that i was not a fan of...overall the food and service has been great !  the place is small and cozy and the owners are very involved with every aspect of the restaurant. you can tell that the owners are passionate about what they do and you can tell that care about your business.  yummy items that i have tried and loved are: hummus: even if this was not homemade ( as indicated in a previous post) i do not care ...it was sooo good.  the house soup..can't remember the name??? it is like a greek version of chicken soup. it is light and delicious and i absolutely love it !!  baked ravioli in alfredo sauce: i have had this twice and i will be getting it again and again...it was so gooey and flavorful.  steak and lobster: this was a special on valentines day and both were cooked to perfection and needed nothing added to it whatsoever. this came with steamed veggies and red potatoes...also cooked perfectly.  flaming baklava: this i have had twice also...it is baklava in all it's glory with scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with orange liquer which the light on fire when they bring to your table.  not so yummy : (   grape leaves: these were ok..i have had worse at my big fat greek restaurant...my main complaint with these was there was too much leaf and too much raw garlic.  spanakopita ( spinach pie): this looked delicious and had fresh spinach...but no flavor whatsoever...none  meatballs: again too much raw garlic.  all in all the good stuff that we have had and the great service we have received will keep me coming back to this place,-1
"poo!  i would think after my last review this place would get their s#it together!  we came here for a birthday event in mid-day saturday.  no ball game, no derby, nothing was really going on sports wise...so you would think service would be better.    i want this place to succeed!  it's a great location, the concept is fantastic, man...the service was still horrible.  the waitress at this establishment are ......hmmmmm -trying to think of something nice.  clueless.   the waitresses here are cute, overwhelmed, clueless, can't remember anything.    i would suggest just go to the bar and order everything.  more than likely you'll get what you want, your tab will correct and your food order maybe correct.  still not impressed.",-1
"this is a great place if money is no object to you! although clean, modern, fresh, and chic, you get what you pay for... a fashionable spot to eat your 4 ounces of frozen yogurt! my wife and i each got a small, hers with a few fruit toppings, mine plain. you then pay by weight, and the two items were over 8 dollars! to me, the place is a total ripoff, no matter how cool or delicious it is. my wife would probably give this joint a 5 star rating, but i can think of ten-thousand better things to spend my money on!",-1
"trying to find parking here is a nightmare, but the atmosphere is great. this is my favorite location. they have a great patio, great beer and the chicken rolls are so good. i crave them all the time. yum!",-1
nice atmosphere with lots of reasonably priced wine.  i asked if there was a corkage and my hostess said no but there is a $10 discount if you take it home.  so yes - there is a corkage.  had the boar chops which the server insisted should be medium or they would be bloody.  ordered medium rate - at least the cooks know what they are doing.  the chops were cooked nicely.  unfortunately they were covered with a crappy bbq sauce that almost single handily destroyed the meal.  fortunately for the crappy bbq sauce there were super salty veggies.  so much salt that they took the honor of destroying the dish.   too bad - chops were good.,-1
"the unfortunately named xtreme bean company is actually quite a homey lil place. located near jo anns fabric in what i refer to as a concrete island (meaning it is part of a strip mall, but not technically connected to said strip mall) with it's own mini-drive through, it is also across the street from sunflower market.   at first it feels like a starfucks rip-off, but the actually delicious looking pastries, cheap prices and staff with actual personalities changes that impression fast. a diverse crowd enjoys the brew here, all kinds of seating (esp. the rather weirdly inviting cubicle room for studying that reminds me of real genius for some reason...maybe it was the bearded guy in there), and plenty of outdoor seating.  my tasty bagel and decaf coffee with soy came out to under 4 bucks and was quite good.  with all the seating and good 'vibes' in this place, a great place for studying or procastinating on studying.   you could bring your dirty hipster friend or your mom here-and that is a good thing.  ***  no taxation on lactose intoleration  after a couple more times coming here, you know what?  not impressed.  i don't like it. i can't eat anything, there is never any seating except in that creepy back room that is supposed to be a study area but always has people babbling away, and i am sick of the dirty hipster punks smoking their anarchy, corporate-sponsored lungs outside.  final straw? i had an entirely unreasonable fight with a barista regarding soy! wtf? i ordered just a regular decaf coffee, and politely asked if they kept soy on the kiosk (you know the one with sugar and milk stuff), and she said they keep it in the fridge. i asked her if i could have some. i notice my total is wrong and go over the order again. where did the extra 50 cents come in? ""oh that is for soy."" ""um, that is like a thimble size of soy. i am not paying 50 cents for that."" ""well, that is the rule"" ""what rule? wildflower, three roots and a bunch of other places don't charge me to use a little bit of soy"" ""it costs extra to get soy."" ""i can get a full container of soy milk across the street at sunflower for a little over a buck. would you prefer i just got a container there for that amount and brought it back with me?"" ""soy milk costs like, over 3 bucks.."" (this statement is accompanied with an eye roll). ""look, i am vegan (a white lie) and extremely lactose intolerance. i can't have milk. they don't get charged for milk. i am not paying that amount. can i just talk to your manager?"" ""we don't like have one right now"" (i swear to god she really talked like this) at this point, some laid back guy just said, ""dude don't charge her."" i thanked him, saying i wasn't trying to be difficult, but paying that much was ridiculous, and he agreed since he was vegan himself.   i called back several times and never got a call back regarding the soy incident.  i know i sound crazy, but goddamn, i am sick of the lactose intolerance tax! soy is hip! everybody drinks soy! and you can get it cheap!  xtreme jerks.",-1
"we were excited to casablanca for date night, as we loved it when it was the estate house. we arrived a bit early for our 7:30pm reservations and were led outside, past all of the cozy seats inside. i thought it odd we weren't asked for a preference.   but wait--it got worse. we were also taken past all of the cozy couches outside facing the movie playing and seated at this strange area way in the back. between our two chairs, which overlooked the street, we had a giant heater and small table (in may). so much for date night. (the light-up menus are totally cool, though the selection is small.)  but wait--it still gets worse. apparently our corner was the smoking area (!?), so they actually seated me, a severe asthmatic, in the middle of it. thanks.  we ordered a crab dip, the sliders and the tacos. while waiting, we did get our well-mixed drinks. but then our waiter totally disappeared. after 35 minutes a water guy apologized for our slow food service. after 45 minutes it finally appeared. the two pork dishes were ok--but served totally lukewarm. the tacos were beautifully plated; the limes even had perfect grill marks on them. but couldn't they put that much care into getting me my damn food in a timely manner? while it's still hot? we didn't care for the crab dip, but that could be a personal thing. the plantain chips were yummy.  the final rub came with the service. our waiter literally never came back after taking our order. when we decided we had enough, we actually went inside and stood at the empty bar and asked for our tab. interestingly, no one thought that was odd.  so there we go. bad service, mediocre food. we won't be back.",-1
"let me know when you people fix the goddamn air-conditioning, and i'll *consider* coming back for a second try.   it is an outrage that you dared to open this in august/september, knew there was an a/c problem (as evidenced by the comments of your staff when some in our party complained), and have still done nothing about it as of late september. absolutely infuriating to walk into a place on a 100-degree night only to find it feeling like 105 inside. i should've listened to the game on the radio in my car. when the waitress asked if there was anything else she could get for us, i almost said ""yeah, a shower.""",-1
"sorry, black chile... i just wasn't a fan!  jared and i felt like trying something new one night last week, and after reading about how great black chile's burger was from our friends at eateraz, we thought we'd give this place a shot.  the restaurant itself is spacious, the hostess and service attentive and friendly, and the decor is tasteful.  but unfortunately the food was nothing special, and i won't be rushing back...  we started with chips and salsa.  i think they bring these to everyone.  these weren't bad.  for our meals, jared went with the burger and i went for the fish tacos (per our waitress's recommendation) and a side of corn.  i liked the sticky rice and beans it came with but the rest of the meal was underwhelming.  jared didn't love his either.  since my visit, i learned that this concept comes from restaurateurs michael mcdermott and jason merritt, who have been involved with the development of numerous restaurants including the famed kona grill. i thought it felt a little chainy!  that explains it ;)  i'm pregnant so i didn't have a corona or margarita, which may have made my meal taste better, but regardless, i've experienced much better mexican food before... and with so many other mexican concepts to choose from in the valley, i probably won't be rushing back. lo siento again, black chile!",-1
"youch! waited for 30 minutes and the place wasn't even busy.. slow service.. even slower kitchen.. pollo fundido was cold (un-melted cheese, stone cold chicken) and tasted like it had been in the fridge for a while! if the stove is broken or the dishwasher, whatever the problem, you really should communicate that to your guests.  the green pond in the back was kind of different..",-1

"i'm sad to say that the place has gone very much downhill since their move to a bigger location. i've given them a few chances hoping it was just growing pains, but it's taken way too long to get back on their game.  i am part of a regular group that used to go here every friday morning. we always sat on the patio of the old place and always got the best service. super friendly, fast coffee refills--they were just on.  after they moved across the street, they began to make it clear that they would not be accommodating our group. they wouldn't set up a table for us and tried to shove us into individual booths, even when there were only 5 or 6 of us. they have a ""back room"" with larger tables that they wouldn't open at the time we got there (~6:00am) claiming staffing issues. they finally and begrudgingly let us back there along with several other larger groups facing a similar circumstance; we were basically ignored. they might has well just told us to our faces that they would not be serving us as a group and saved us all the trouble.  don't read between the lines here--we are not a loud, annoying, or demanding group. we are just some guys that like to get together at breakfast.  sadly, our concerns were not heard or passed on to anyone who cared, so i doubt we will ever be back. we've since moved on to places that will gladly accept our business.",-1
"this place was ruff on my stomach, i got the yellow curry here.  i heard about this place on yelp because me and my friend wanted some chinese food.    well the place is clean and my friend said that his dish (orange chicken) was just ok,  after i was done eating i felt my stomach screaming 'what did you do to me, i have always been your friend'.    there is also a pei wei in the same area and i wish we just went to them because it is a bit better quality then this place.  i even had it a couple hours later after the meal cold, and i dont even know why i just felt like giving it another shot, but nope it was still making my insides hurt.    recommendation: i would try somewhere else unless you hate your stomach,and if you do, try something else then the curry.",-1
"mediocre at best. not too tasty. salsa blah, beans and rice too salty. only thing i feel confident in recommending is the mexican pizza app w/ chicken. big enough to share.  other than that, the price is too expensive for the food served.",-1
"went today. not very busy and still took about 15 mins to get 2 burgers and a shake. the reason is because our burgers were done but they were doing training so our burgers sat there while the one server went through all of the procedure to adding pickles, lettuce etc, all the garnishments. that alone took a good 5 mins. meanwhile our burger sat there getting cold. also the fries.  then they called us up, i alreayd knew it was going to be cold because we saw how long it had been sitting out with 2 employees hovering over it.  burgers were cold, fries were cold. had to send it all back. unreal!!!!  i have been to joes at least 20x since its in our neighborhood and our last 5 experiences have been horrible.  so disappointing. this place used to be great!",-1

"the only good thing about this place was the excellent tasting and unique cocktails.  the buck stops there.  i came here last night with a group of ten and although they don't take reservations they ended up reserving a large table for us, which was pretty nice of them.  all the cocktails i tried were unique and tasty but overpriced.  the sushi was really bland and nothing better then ra.  i was hesitant to try the lobster ceviche because of the whopping $21 price tag, but i figured it would be awesome and a generous portion.  when the ceviche arrived it had  three measly lettuce cups and virtually no lobster at all; the few tiny pieces of lobster i did find were tasteless.  i was so disappointed, and actually pretty pissed.  what a scam and ripoff.  i'm not a cheap person but that was just plain robbery.  i didn't even eat a full cup and didn't touch the rest; when the waitress was within earshot i commented how i didn't like the dish, but she never said a word.  i work in the food industry and you should be able to tell when a dish isn't being eaten because the customer doesn't enjoy it.    our waitress was pretty attentive and friendly but she wasn't present very often.  the whole ""no split checks"" thing is bs!  it is not hard to split checks and unless they hand write all orders, the p.o.s system is clearly able to do it.  forcing groups to share one tab isn't convenient for anyone, including the server, and it just pisses people off.  also the booths are too low for the tables are feel really awkward; good thing we were the first to arrive and got to nab the chairs!    total bill was $659.00 for ten people.  this place is not worth that type of money at all.  such an utter disappointment.",-1
"scale of 1-10 (multiple visits): 10 food 9 *drinks* 8 service 9 atmosphere 7 value  my original review for here was a ""meh, mediocre"".  since then, there have been some menu adjustments, i've explored more of the menu, and i've generally gotten my head out of my ass.  the place is still pricey if you're looking for affordable and don't know what to order.  if that is the case, then let me direct you to the green papaya salad (w/ shrimp or tofu), the sugar cane pork, or the spicy wontons.  if available when you're there, the pesto edamame and the pad thai are also excellent ways to not break the bank.  (the pad thai can even leave leftovers if you're not super hungry.)  the bacon-wrapped _____ are also delicious, as is pretty much anything in the ""fried"" section.  i know a number of people that don't like the hong kong flat rice, but they're just silly, because i think it's great.  the service is friendly and very well informed, though there are occasional timing issues.  that's totally okay though, because their pours seem generous, making the somewhat-steep cocktail prices not really that bad after all.  all in all i admit that i was wrong giving sens a (weak) 3-stars last year.  i should have given it a (strong) 4-stars all along.",-1
"dang!  i wish i had seen the reviews prior to visiting this restaurant but...it was not my choice, actually.  what completely freaked me out was that the bill was $85.00!  $85.00 for a meal for two!  for mexican food!?  excuse me!!!???  the atmosphere was nice, the waitstaff was average, and the food was sub-par.  actually, the fish tacos were the worst i have tasted but my date loved the carnitas.  the pitchers of margaritas are largely filled with ice.  and everything is waaay overpriced for the flavor and quality of the food.  i won't return.",-1
"to all you scottstitutes,  we've noticed that ever since westgate opened, you've been quite the fixture at your modest, trendy over-priced hellhole of a strip mall. we really do appreciate your company, and we especially appreciate all of that fancy scottsdale money you keep throwing at all the local businesses. but i'm getting the feeling that you're still not ""getting"" it. there seems to be some misunderstandings and misconceptions about westgate, and i would like to take this opportunity to clear some of them up for you.  1) i don't care how expensive your meal or that new pair of pumas was, you're still on the west side. hence all the chains. that 40 dollar bottle of face cream your girlfriend just got could've been bought at arrowhead mall.   2) this is not your neighborhood. don't let the condos and 12 dollar appetizers fool you. one step outside of the parking lot and you're in the fucking jungle, my friend. and the jungle is a ""no popped collar"" zone. i've looked into it.   3) while some of the businesses may seem to have been imported from scottsdale, the uninspired employees who work at these establishments are definitely not. you may have noticed that when you try to park in certain public spaces by the stadium, you'll be approached by grizzled men in ""parking staff"" shirts demanding that you pay them to park in ""their"" area. or that when you complain to the waiter that your meal is being rained on by a leaky pipe, he just laughs and offers you a napkin. this is the west side, sucka. as dracula once said, ""our ways are not your ways"".  4) while the tragically underdressed plebians and their families roaming the strip mall may be unsightly and crude, the fact is they live here.   5) don't bitch about how happy hour is so crowded. this is the only time that the aforementioned locals can afford to eat at all these fine establishments.   6) if the piano bar on the second level charges you a cover, it's probably because they don't think your girlfriend is all that hot. or because you don't have one in the first place. oh, burned by the doorman!  7) if there's a wait to get a table at yardhouse, the last thing you should do is walk back and forth by the patio waiting for a table to magically open up. it only entices those with a table to order more booze and keep their table longer.   8) if you're afraid of clowns or people in stilts, don't go to margaritaville before a game/concert. they can sense your fear and will only use it against you.  9) while it may be tempting, do not make out on the escalator, no matter how hard the mood strikes you. there is a 80 percent chance that some teenager is running as fast as fast as he can to go in the opposite way on the one you're on.   10) if you're going to ask me what time it is, at least have the common fucking sense to hide your watch. if you can't figure out what i am, then you can stand by the restrooms and see which one i go into, like all the other sane people do.  thank you/go fuck yourself, jetta",-1
"my gf and i fluttered over to the wcg the other night.    i was informed that wcg is ""reallllly good but kinda pricey"".    pshaw, i laugh in the face of pricey...   (except at mastro's, then i cry like a little girl).    walking in, i noticed the  oustide of the place was modern and lemmie tell ya, i like modern.  well lets say modernish...yeah.  before we took the plunge inside, i decided to read the gilded framed menu suspended next to the entry door;  while i was reading at least 2 different blue hairs going in had to stop and tell me how fabulous the food was .  hook , line and sinker.  i mean, if you can't believe the old farts, who can you believe?  this place is kinda dark inside. not deliverance or deer hunter dark, but ""i need a night light"" sorta dark.  i agree with the other yelper, this place is a nap-danger for adults.  soup should be served sparingly inside to prevent table drownings.  it was rather nice inside though, i liked it.. just dark.  the booth was nice and squishy too, just the way i like em'.  i had the 6 oz filet, and my dahlin' had the crab cakes.  both were quite tasty, but my mashed 'taters were kinda sub par considering the price tag. (why are masheds so ignored?? why??)  granted we orderd off the date menu, a fixed price bastard that let us choose 1 app, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert to share.  i'd bore the crap outta you if i went into details about every course, but they were all good in a passable kinda way.  i'm writing this review aren't i?  irony upon irony, the desserts you could pick from on said ""date"" menu, even though all desserts are listed at the same price, did not include the white chocolate cheese cake.  black flagged again.  i even tried to substitute and the staunchly refused.  i will get even with them i swear.  synopsis (sp?)  not bad, but once again az has introduced me to another restaurant that i don't want to frequnent often if i don't have too.  i really wanted to love wcg, but i think i'll stick with tgif's.",-1
"not sure what exactly they serve here. i certainly wouldn't call it frozen yogurt...  i guess if you mixed a slurpee, ice cream and yogurt and made them taste like pasty, icy soft-serve you would have mojo's version of ""frozen yogurt"".  it doesn't help that it's ridiculously over-priced and you really have no way of knowing that the yogurt is going to cost you $7-13 (compared to $2-4 at golden spoon) until you get to the register where they weigh your self-served yogurt & toppings then empty your wallet.  also definitely not a fan of the self-serve toppings. how many booger/staph/fecal--tainted fingers do you think have been all over those serving spoons or even in (kids' fingers) the toppings?",-1
"visted twice in the past few weeks.  first visit was for happy hour, and i tried three items at $5 each: the house margarita, the churrasco (steak skewers) cooked medium-rare, and a tex-mex take on eggrolls.  loved the margarita... one of the best i've ever had!  really liked the eggrolls (pork, carrots, black beans).  can't say the same for the skewers, though, as they weren't cooked enough- chewy texture and still pretty bloody, actually.  yes, i ordered them cooked medium-rare, but i've ordered steak burgers at the same temperature before at a few other places and all came out very edible.  these weren't.  if i were to order them again, and i probably won't, i'd go for medium to medium-well.   on the second visit, i had their cheeseburger, cooked medium-rare, with smoked gouda (wow!), sweet potato fries as the accompanying side, and (subbed) chipotle mayo.  i found the buns used very, very tasty- loved the grilled texture.  last, but certainly not least, the sweet potato fries were superb!  these were light, non-greasy, no cinnamon-sugar coating, and easy on the salt.  i loved it both ways- at times plain, and other times dipped in the chipotle mayo.  should i ever have a craving for spf, i'm heading to cafe carumba!   very friendly service and clean women's restroom.  i'll definitely be back!",-1

"i'm fairly certain i've had a good dining experience here, though i'd be hard pressed to come up with exactly when that was. i was here the other night, and it was pretty bad. unfortunately, this result is more the rule than the exception for me. i swear this place is like the tara reid of restaurants.  the place is pretty nice... comfy chairs, loungy sofa style seating, lovely patio, clean and open dining area (with hideous gaudy bedazzled dog statues placed strategically so you can sit anywhere and see a faux diamond encrusted canine anus while you eat), and a nice long modern (for 10 years ago) bar. the exterior walls are mostly glass so if you're at all self conscious, you might feel like you're on display.   this was a mid-week night and it was pretty dead. there were literally more waitstaff than tables seated, yet the table next to us had one of their orders completely forgotten. then the same waiter kept asking what we wanted to drink and while we were ordering, he would walk away for 10 minutes. the service didn't get much better from there. when we finally got to order and then eventually get our food, it was mediocre... definitely not worth the lofty prices. in fact, the burgers used to be considered quite good here - the burger hasn't changed much, but i guess maybe the bar has been raised since they designed theirs. this place just needs to revamp a little bit i think. they also need some new staff.  like tara reid, this joint is an old diseased coked up used up whore that hangs out with the under/upper crust of society, can't act or even perform basic functions half the time, pretty much everyone has been inside at some point, half the people come to watch the train wreck while the other half comes to be on the train, and on the right nights is fun to party with.",-1

"we ended up at elements friday night with my in-laws on their last night in phoenix, as we thought it would be a nice way to end their trip. our server was absolutely fantastic - she did a good job of answering questions, helping with selections, and making sure we had everything we needed without being in our face. since we had a later reservation (8:45 pm), the restaurant was pretty full when we arrived, but as the night progressed, it emptied out. this time, noise was not a factor which was a relief.  my father-in-law ordered the special that evening which was similar to ahi tuna...he loved it. the rest of us ordered the scallop dish...it left us a bit underwhelmed. the scallops were on the bland side, although they were cooked pretty well. they could have used some seasoning to make them really good. our desserts (chocolate torte and chocolate peanut butter decadence) were delicious and totally redeemed the meal in my mind. a bottle of wine, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts, set my in-laws back $230.  i still think elements is a great place, but my husband and i were a bit let down that it wasn't as phenomenal as last year when we went for dinner.",-1
"their bone-in-filet is amazing! it ruined every other steak that i have had in the past. the outside was crispy & salty while the center melted in your mouth like butter. the lobster mashed potatoes were creamy with huge chunks of lobster. asparagus was cooked to perfection.  finish dinner off with a butter cake. i often will skip desert from other places just to grab a cake to go.  when you go there, ask for your waiter to be tobias. he was wonderful and did a wonderful job with a++ service.",-1
"i went to last night's kick-off preview of the lady with all the answers.    although i knew that i was going to see a show that was based on the story of ann landers, i didn't know much more about it than that.  nancy dussault did an incredible job in this 'one woman show.'  i truly felt like i had an intimate evening with ann landers!  as much as i entertained myself growing up reading ann landers' column, i never really thought about her own life... although she was 'the lady with all the answers,' she had a life also - and you'll learn all about it when you see this show!  i don't want to spoil too much for those of you that will go see it.  (it's showing through november 30th, so definitely go if you can!)  i will however say that the acting is fabulous, the set is extremely well done, costumes believable, etc... i'm sure it's tough for one woman to hold the attention of a theater full of people, but dussault did an outstanding job with it.  i will admit, it was slow at times, but overall, impressive, believable, and fun!    as i walked out of the show with my friend, we discussed the show a bit.  we both felt like in the (just less than) 2 hours we spent at the herberger, we really got an inside look at who ann landers was.  we laughed, i almost cried, we participated a bit, saw some some fellow yelpers, met some new ones, and just had a really good time.    whether you grew up reading ann landers' column or not, you'll enjoy this show.  arizona theatre company did it again, and i can't wait for the remainder of the season!",-1
"as a huge fan of greek food, i am always looking for something authentic, something skin to the mediterranean snack bar where i grew up, burning my little fingers on the hot dish which held my often craved spinach casserole. i sat on tall chairs with my mother, my legs dangling as i looked around at the small restaurant. the meat on a spit, the bright blues and whites of the decor. the tempe location of mbfgr gets one more star than the chandler location, but then my review of the chandler location was damn near scathing, so that's not saying much. to make an honest comparison, i ordered the same thing: the chicken souvlaki pita. this time i went with the side salad, which was full of bright colors and fresh looking. the food arrived in good time and the chicken was tasty, if lukewarm. the service was friendly, even if our waitress forgot to bring pitas. mbfgr just does not come close to my childhood memories, but then that was new york. i agree with melissa h. that everyone can find something that they like. the food is so americanized. at least they could serve it hot. if anyone has any authentic greek suggestions...?",-1

this is my favorite stadium to watch a spring training game. maybe it's because i remember watching the firebirds play here and well the tickets are cheap. i even get a $2-4 discount with my credit union debit card.   they sell nathan's hot dogs! yum! they also have margaritas and snow cones. you can't go wrong with either.   the views here are amazing although trying to get into the parking lot sucks. great location. not too far from tempe or south scottsdale.,-1

"asian fusion food.  very busy, usually a wait for dinner.  the food is above average, but the decor is very cramped.  with the usual crowd, this is not a place for a sedate dinner, but its central location makes it a nice place to eat before doing something else in the area.",-1

"i accidentally stumbled upon last chance looking for another store, and i had to share my experience on yelp.   i walked into the store and saw a small indoor mall, took the escalator down and stumbled upon a mess of ravenous women who were on a mission to get as many pairs of children's shoes as possible. i heard a loud voice screaming over the crowd (by a worker) ""everyone step away from the shoes and don't touch them until we restock!""   i have to admit that at this point i was scared, but intrigued at what was inside this store that would cause these woman to behave in this manner.   now, i will admit, there were some amazing finds. i saw very high end designer shirts for less than $10. but, i have to agree with other 2 star reviews in that these clothes are pretty gross.   i probably will not return. for those of you who have not been and are reading reviews, the best i can compare this mad house is a 50% off sale at goodwill. but, about 50 times worse. i have also seem similar behavior on christmas eve at grocery stores in mexico (and in a food city in downtown phoenix) by the meat department.   you have to be a pretty dedicated shopaholic to deal with these crazy women.     p.s.- parking is terrible in this shopping mall.",-1

"i was a big fan of lis doon varna, the original restaurant that the building was built and housed for some years before its untimely closure earlier this year. it was the most authentic irish restaurant i've been to in arizona (see: *most*, though it couldn't be labelled *an* authentic restaurant) and i was really sad it closed. i thought i'd give the building's new owner a try and i can't help but compare it to lis doon on every level. the inside is completely the same - they must have acquired all the furniture and fixtures along with the unique building. they seem to have added some random photos and things on the wall (framed ink-jet print-outs of the kennedy family add a touch of class) to make it theirs but it's mostly the same.  the menu is where things get really different. johnny fox's menu is a lot smaller and a lot less irish. the prices (a bit on the expensive side) are about the same but it seems like it's all the usual ""pub food"" you find in ""irish"" restaurants around phoenix. nothing original here and it makes me sad to see things like alfredo sauce covered pasta on the menu. i opted for a cup of the shrimp bisque and the sausage roll appetizer with a bottle of magner's while mom went for the cottage pie (misnamed sheppard's pie on the menu) and house white wine. the bisque was very good and came in a small casserole dish with a handful of soup crackers on the side. the sausage rolls were awesome though i'm not sure what type of ""sausage"" they used - seemed a bit hot doggy but still tasted good. those were filled with onions, mustard and baked in pastry dough and went well with my cider and bisque. the cottage pie wasn't anything special but was also good. definitely not worth its $14 price tag, though. i could make better at home for around $5 in ingredients (and who gets the idea that food originally devised for poor people by poor people can be over $10 a plate?).   service was decent though the waitress was super perky. pro tip for customer service: if you're giving way more than you get back, maybe tone it down a bit. it just puts the customer off. we were also served the wrong table's plates  and the waiter said, ""ugh, *someone* is putting the wrong table numbers in!"" obviously referring to our waitress. very professional. the food also took awhile (the food wrongly served us would have been about the right time for restaurant food, but ours took another 15 or so minutes after that -  i could only assume ours had been served to someone else) though the waitress did pop by to say our food was on its way instead of leaving us hanging.  over all, i will very much miss what lis doon varna was and will not be back to this restaurant. the décor alone is just simply not enough to make it worth my time. i'll keep a look out for some real irish fun here in the desert (though i'm not holding my breath).",-1

"i'm not really sure how this places survives in this economy. it's overpriced with poor service and the food is mediocre at best. stopped by today for lunch and we weren't even sure we had a food server it took him so long to get to our table. he was ""rushed"" through the whole meal.  when we asked him questions about the meal he acted like it was an imposition to answer our questions.  items we ordered:   glass of white french wine, iced tea, bowl of french onion soup, basiled chicken and brie sandwich, chicken salad, creme brulee for dessert.  our bill came out to 57.83.   this meal was not worth that price.   on the menu it stated the chicken salad had basil in it.  when i received the salad no basil.   i even asked the food runner if it had basil and she assured me it did.   i informed the waiter and he agreed they omitted it.    bread is also not automatically brought to the table.   you must ask for it otherwise you're out of luck.   food was also on the salty side.   i would not recommend spending your hard earned money here.   there are better places with great food and service for the price.",-1

"i've got to say, even after all the day drinking we did before stopping it, this place still was a disappointment.   i'll be honest, we only came here because geisha had an hour and fifteen minute wait. crazy.  there were four of us. sitting on the patio. in the dark. bring a flashlight, seriously it's dark. and something to stabilize the table... they wobble. good thing there's no cutting involved.  my buddy and i ordered edamame to start, and then  the crispy spicy tuna and the spicy shrimp and scallops. the scallops is $21!! we were a little hesitant at the price of just one item but to use his words ""oh man, we're in for a real treat!"".  out comes the food. the crispy spicy tuna is four pieces. womp womp. all it is... is crunch. no real flavor or spiciness. just super hard and crunchy.  then the real joke comes. our spicy shrimp and scallops is literally one overcooked jumbo shrimp, two smallish scallops and four rice cakes sitting in a bowl of broth. i'll give them this, the broth was delicious. super spicy and awesome. but the portion size is a joke considering the price. we were laughing hysterically at our gross overstatement of a ""real treat"".   oh and the edamame was never brought out. our server... jennifer? jessica? she was sweet and apologized and graciously removed it from the bill.   the bathrooms are super weird also. the sliding door is like wide open for the restaurant to see in to and i wasn't sure if i was supposed to shut it... strange. each stall is closed, but you can see the urinals in the men's room as you walk in to the women's. very awkward and not too clean.  i won't return.",-1
"what an excellent lunch i had here! rand h. organized a little uye for this place with mike c., robyn n., arlin b. and myself. the establishment is in a rather cramped commercial strip but the restaurant itself is quite roomy, although it doesn't look it at first when you enter. i ordered a ceviche appetizer; this was the best ceviche i've ever had -- i would come here just for this! for my entree, i had the bistecas y huevos with rice and beans; it came with sides of avocado and mexican cheese. i also had a refreshing glass of mango agua fresca which accompanied the meal perfectly. great food, great prices, and great service even when the place is busy - no wonder this place is so popular.",-1
"i'm continuing with my downtown streak of reviews... i finally made it to switch!  this review is for my experience at lunchtime... and let me warn you, it gets busy during the weekday lunch hours, so go early or go late, but arrive at noon, and more than likely you will have to wait.  however, the community table is an option if you go solo or with a small group.  another warning - the parking situation at noon - i think i lucked out and got the last spot in the lot; i happened to see a truck leaving when i came in, but there didn't seem to be any other open spots.  i noticed that durant's next door offered 'humble valet parking' (interesting signage), but not sure if you are dining at switch where you would park in this scenario.  i walked in through the back, and i liked the atmosphere and vibe immediately.  i was told there was a 20 minute wait for my party of 3, so i found myself a seat and did some work while i waited.  pretty sure they have wifi although i was using my verizon card.  great people watching was distracting me too; enough so that i missed when the rest of my party walked in!  anyways, i caught up with them and enjoyed a great lunch...  service was right on, and it was an overall delightful dining experience.  i had the 'super chop' salad - it had a little bit of everything in it (artichokes, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, sunflower seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach & field greens) - and i added turkey for a small extra charge... it was a huge serving and the perfect healthy lunch!  (note to self and to anyone else that may be interested in adding protein to your salad in the future - go with something other than the turkey... i hate to sound picky, but it wasn't amazing).  anyways, my two new friends (kate and angie) are regulars at switch, so they ordered the hummus and lamb apps and shared - good idea!  i tried the hummus and it was tasty - i like how they served it with pita and sides of artichokes and peppers.  it was a tad different than the hummus at fez, or at least that is what we all decided.  we were all very satisfied and too full for dessert... i guess i'll have to come back to try that another time.  dessert and a bunch of other menu items that sounded good.  i also noticed that switch serves breakfast all day on saturday and sundays, and does catering - good to know!",-1
"the view alone deserves an excellent review. this restaurant is located inside the hyatt regency hotel... a circular shaped building that spins (yes, spins) to give you a rotating view of the entire city. it's absolutely beautiful and the ambiance is incredibly romantic.   i ordered the double cut lamb rack and he ordered the angus ribeye. the meat was cooked exactly the way we requested... we both prefer medium and the chef figured out the perfect balance of not to bring it out bloody - but not overcooked either. we finished off with the creme brulee cheesecake, some fancy chocolate cake and a red wine our server recommended. i definitely loved the dessert more... so much so that he had to remind me how many hours we would be in the gym tomorrow. talk about a sugar buzz kill...  the wait staff are friendly and consistently check on you. we didn't have to wait for water refills or the bill to come out. i was definitely impressed.  it is, however, a pricey restaurant (prepare to spend about $150 for two people) but i think it was well worth it.",-1
"a friend and i were meeting up for lunch and the original plan was to go to a different thai place we'd been to before.  unfortunately that place didn't open until 5:00 and we met up at 3:00...fail.  luckily i used my handy-dandy yelp app to find other thai places within a nearby radius and thai e-san was the closest one and had a decent rating.  it's definitely a pretty nondescript building but i figured that a lot of the time those are the hidden gems that most people don't give a chance to.  we walked in and someone was already waiting with menus (i'm assuming he saw us pull up through the windows) and took us to a table right away.  there was only one other group in the restaurant but it was a little late for normal lunch and early for dinner so i wasn't surprised.  it worked out nicely for us though as our waitress was able to check on us frequently and made sure our drinks were always full and we had everything we needed.  the menu is huuuuge!!  there are at least 70+ items to choose from so it's a little overwhelming at first and if you're indecisive like me it's quite the task picking just one thing!  i ended up going with the spicy fried rice with basil with beef as the meat.  i also ordered the thai egg rolls.  my friend got something with silver noodles, i can't remember what it was listed as on the menu.  the egg rolls came out nice and hot and crispy, flavor was good and i love that they have the sweet and sour sauce in bottles on the table so you can apply it as you like.  the main dishes came out not to long after and portions were very generous.  i ate more than i probably should have because it was so good and it looked like i'd barely touched my plate.  even my friend who is 6'8"" couldn't finish his plate.  we both concluded that we were happy the other thai place was closed as this one had a bigger selection and bigger portions so it seems like it was meant to be!",-1
"never one to let the idea of three square meals a day deter me from enjoying a visit to a new city my three plus days in phoenix, scottsdale, glendale, and chandler would additionally lead me to a number of ancillary eats - some upscale and french, some down n' dirty southwest, some new, some old, some hot, and some cold.  beginning first with my love of pastries, the first of these six stops would be at the combined grocery, café, bakery, liquor store, souvenir stand, and pizza parlor that is la grande orange grocery; the sort of place you have to see to believe yet the sort of place where it all seems to ""fit.""  harbored in a small strip mall with plenty of parking plus curbside checkout for those on the go i made my way into la grande orange only half knowing what to expect and having already mentioned the commodities entailed the only thing i could think of when i entered the door was a trip to whole foods if you condensed the entirety of one store into a space approximately one quarter the size.  with cups to one side and cupcakes to the other, wine to my right and coffee to my left my first impression was one of total sensory overload yet at the same once i entered and started to browse i detected a sort of controlled chaos as the various lines moved toward their destination with a good flow.    having already eaten breakfast and had plenty of coffee with pizza plans at bianco for later in the day i took my time investigating the space - children's toys, shirts, travel mugs, cheeses, pre-made salads, locally roasted coffees - before finally approaching the pastry counter to browse the cornucopia of goods.  with many items baked in house and others provided by tammie coe bakery two doors down i weighed the options carefully while additionally gauging my hunger and although any number of the options sounded delectable i ended up settling for two; one my own choice and a sort of obligation at this point and the other a recommendation from the young woman at the counter as ""the best thing in the world;"" a promise i told her i'd hold her to if she was wrong, and after paying the modest tab i made my way to the street with my choices packed up (ostensibly for later, but in reality for enjoyment less than thirty minutes later as i checked into my hotel.)  beginning first with my selection, la grande orange's very own red velvet cupcake, this large specimen wrapped in red wax paper and topped with an ample pile of cream cheese frosting would prove to be one of the better red velvets i've had in some time save for the stellar version at bouchon bakery just one month prior.  loaded with notes of cocoa and sugar plus the faint taste of cinnamon and what i'm pretty sure was clove i really enjoyed the subtle nuance to this cake and despite the $3.95 price tag the portion was substantially larger and the cake significantly more moist than more expensive versions in other major cities.  moving next to the suggestion of my cashier, the tammie coe crumb bun, i really was not sure what to expect of the $2.50 option but what i received, while not the best thing in the world, was without a doubt the best sweet i had on my visit to arizona.  beginning first with the exterior, this golden biscuit looked something like a cinnamon roll meets a scone with a spiral texture encased in crystal sugar, but digging deeper and peeling off a layer the texture was instead somewhat akin to the famous breton kouign amann kissed with cinnamon and topped with streusel.  layer after buttery layer, bite after yeasty bite, and making a mess of the carpet (crumb bun indeed) all the while all i can say is that if you find yourself in the phoenix area this is a must try and given the quality of both selections i was lucky to be staying so far from la grande orange and tammie coe because otherwise i'd have gone back for more.",-1
"it has been 2 years since my initial review and i still faithfully visit here. my current favorites are the jalapeno burger (they fry the jalapenos and they are amazing), the 5 meat pizza, and the oreo pazookie. they also added some new pazookies to the menu and the white chocolate raspberry is amazing. the service is always fantastic, love the atmosphere, and they always have a new list of seasonal brews.  they just started a loyalty card and i am saving up for the free $25 gift card. it is easy to use and i can check my balance on line. i am halfway there!",-1

(i would have drunk more wine btw.) i know that there were a few issues with the orders too, although my order was correct.  maybe it was an overly busy night, short staff or poor organization?? anyway, i would go back if someone else wanted to go there but it would not be my 1st choice.",-1

"the service here has really gone downhill. i love the concept of whole foods and the range of options given. being a vegetarian/vegan, this is one of the few places that you can come for a whole range of options. the produce here is always great. plus,i also enjoy the smoothie bar and the pizza that they will put in a to-go box for you.  however, there have been 2 times now where i have had lackluster service, sometimes even downright rude. i have come to expect this at lesser stores but not at whole foods. one male cashier that we had did not even acknowledge us the entire time he was scanning our items, but instead told awkward inside jokes to his friend who was bagging our groceries. he didn't talk with us through the whole transaction and after the bags made their way into the cart, he shouted ""later!"" like a surfer dude and resumed chatting with his bff. this is no way to treat the customers of your store, especially when we drive way out of our way to come here.  yes, i returned even after the aforementioned experience, thinking it must be a fluke.  so...yesterday we went and again were treated rudely, by guess what? the same guy. this time he was bagging the groceries and did such a poor job that my husband had to stop and re-do it himself on our way out. he was in such a rush that he couldn't bag our groceries properly.  it's too bad. please fire this man.

"i wasn't very impressed with it at all.  all the renovations are nice, and it was nice to be able to sit and have a beer while i watched the movie but everything else sucked.  the service sucked.  the food sucked. the as to the service, they take your order on a little ipad sort of thing, each person is assigned a seat number...i don't believe they actually record the seat down as the waitress continually brought everything to me. other peoples food and drinks...and checks! ugh. also she brought my 15 year old cousin a beer! wtf! we all received our food at the same time, except for my husband...he had ordered a burger and for some reason it took a good 15 minutes to arrive.  drink service was quick.  the food itself was sub-par. i got chicken tenders. they did not have the taste or texture of chicken. they were really weird.   i would say save your money and don't order dinner here. we will be back, but will only do drinks and light snacks.",-1
"stopped in for happy hour after reading some positive reviews.  we were really not impressed with the food.   we ordered what the server recommended and it tasted like microwaved frozen food, reminding me of the sort of thing you might get  at a low-budget corporate event.  excellent service and very pretty space but frankly, the worst food i've eaten at fashion square.  i've eaten at their other locations in vegas and beverly hills and i don't remember them being this mediocre, so i'm not sure what the problem is.  it just doesn't make sense to eat here when you've got a half dozen much better options within walking distance.",-1
"cute store! reminds me of the awesome little french bakeries in nyc. part knick knack store, part breakfast/sweets. i bought an item off the sale/day old rack and it was quite good.",-1
"um, something has happened to this place, and it ain't good. i felt like i walked into a cronenberg film where you don't know if anything is real.  every redeeming quality is now gone. the roaming singer is gone. they have a bar but don't even produce drink menus any more, and the waitstaff can't readily list drinks available. not good when the wife is looking for drinks. the service is awkward and slow, even though they sat us at a table next to at least a half dozen servers who loitered around the kitchen area with the manager. i couldn't tell if they were off the clock or hanking or both.   the only reason we went here is because they take reservations and someone in our party was concerned about restaurants being crowded. the hostess made a point of telling us over the phone that they don't usually take reservations on such short notice, but they would accommodate us. when we arrived, the place was mostly empty. inflated sense of self-importance, much?  the only reason i bothered updating this is because you might be like me: easily conned into going here when you're hungry. well, resist the temptation and insist on going elsewhere.",-1
"can i tell you how much i despised fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit? i should have known the second i realized that bliss/rebar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.  and so it is. we showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. there is no hostess or even a hint of one. we stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? the place was dead.). we were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. um, it's 40 degrees...  and the place was dead. i guess we'll wait. we go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. the server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. that's sure inviting, isn't it.  so we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so i go with the veggie sandwich. that sounds innocuous enough, right? the food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. my ""veggie"" sandwich arrives and it looks like a filet-o-fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. i couldn't help it - i asked the server what the hell it was.   eggplant.  ohhhhkay then.   it was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. impossible. the pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. only jenna jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. my companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. there was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. i wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although i almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.  so, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes mia. you'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. nope. no. nada. had to chase someone down and ask for it. when it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low i couldn't check it out. i was so over the whole experience at the point i didn't even care. i left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours.   just ugh in every way.",-1
"a tad bit disappointing...   my newest pet peeve is waiting for a table when i have reservations. a recent occurrence happened this weekend when i showed up five minutes early for my 830pm reservations and was finally seated at a table at 850pm. the accommodating hostess did present us with two glasses of rose, but when we sat down, we realized we weren't that special because everyone else around us were also served complimentary rose...   the meal was off to a decent start with the lamb riblettes and paprika cured pork belly. the glaze on the riblettes was slightly sweeter than my palette likes, but the flavor on the lamb was really wonderful. i was surprisingly pleased with the pork belly. i have gotten to the point where i swore off pork belly for so long because no one knew how to 'wow' with it. a fatty piece of pork can do well on its own, but i like to think the kitchen tried, and the staff here did an awesome job. i had also never had sarga turo, and really enjoyed it with the pork belly and golden beets. we were again slightly disappointed when a new couple sat next to us and was advised of a drink and entree special for the night that our server neglected to tell us.  the most disappointing part of the meal was the main course. we both ordered fish for our main since we had red meat for our appetizers. the yellowtail looked very dry as it was sat on the table, and its texture was the same. the chilled tuna was slightly better, but unimpressive.  my date later pointed out that the yellowtail served to our neighboring table was both cooked and plated much better.   i feel like this place has a lot of potential, but definitely has more room for improvement. i may give it another go, but i'd have to be convinced it can be done better next time.",-1
"this place looks like would be good, but sadly, it is not. the portions are huge, and the food is very generic. we won't be returning here unless someone else wants to go here!",-1
great fresh salads and fresh new flavors for their slice of the day.  perfect for lunch inside or outside on the nice shaded patio.  plus i love it when you tell your server you're splitting something and they do the work for you and bring it on two plates.,-1
full disclosure - i am not a member and never have been. i tried this gym last week using a 3 day pass.   i will not be signing up.   this gym is extremely busy. it is very challenging to put in a good workout without waiting for the majority of my workout. i even found myself waiting around just for some extra space to stretch before lifting.  one afternoon there was an entire high school football team working out which i thought odd considering it was the 5pm rush hour.   on a positive note this gym might have the most attractive clientele that i have ever seen. it's on par with the lifetime up near scottsdale and the 101 only this gym's demographics are much younger. if i were 10 years younger i would probably join this gym just to walk around and socialize. maybe get in a few sets in between fist bumps with the fellas. fortunately i am wise enough to know that there are better places than the gym to socialize and better places than la fitness to work out.,-1
"this place is a dump. if you need to get rid of some books, just donate them to goodwill or a veterans group, because you'll get more self satisfaction. i dropped off about 40 books today and they would only offer me $3. $3? are you effing serious? nope, no thank you. i'll drop them off at the va.  if you're looking for older fictional books or records, this place has a pretty serious selection; however, if you're looking for something more present and/or relevant, look somewhere else. hell, if you're looking for a 1990's version study guide for the sat, then this is your place!  this place is so outdated, you can see the dust when you walk in...",-1
"love this pizza!!!!!!!!!!!!!  omg so good!  the crust is that like thin but crunchy kind, and the red sauce on the pizzas is absolutely perfect. i like their wide array of pizzas and toppings (even though i can't have any pesto pizza because of the nuts in the pesto, boo)  this place, and classic italian in tempe are the best pizza places i've been in to az hands down.",-1
"i had almost given up on mexican food in phoenix.  i tried this place on a friday during lunch.  i had a combo meal that included a taco and cheese enchilada.  this restaurant is one of my new favorites.  the cheese enchilda was a great choice.  excellent flavor.  the taco was also nice and crispy, and the beef had great flavor.  the chips and salsa were very good.  the salsa was not the best i have ever had, but very good.  i wish they would put the salsa in bowls.  i cant stand eating salsa off of plates.  i will definitely return to this location.  great food and service.",-1
"stopped in for a happy hour experience and everyone is very friendly from the hostessess to the bartenders. very reasonable drink prices between 4 and 7pm with the highlight being the $3.50 18oz pours of whatever you want (i got some newcastle). hot pretzels are always my favorite and these pretzels were 2 for $5 and served nice and hot and with an unusual roasted pepper cheese sauce that at least for me had a nice kick to it and caused some sweating, but it was an enjoyable sweat. very nice tv setup and they will turn on any game you want. only negative is valet parking. i got there early, but probably better to park somewhere else, instead of heading into the main lot after 6pm.",-1
"the clarendon is a hotel with a real level of charm to it.  i've been to a lot of hotels and most of them, most of the higher-end hotels that cater to a lot of business travelers are so dull and lifeless that it's almost extraordinary that you could deliberately suck all of the life out of your hotel's decor.  this hotel does have some genuine life to it and it's the small things that make the difference, like playing music underwater in the pool.  better yet, playing awesome music underwater in the pool like the cramps.  i've always liked staying at hotels in my own city.  it's fun not being home, it's like having a sleepover as an adult without having to crash on someone's couch and wake up the next morning with a fucked up back and shoulder.  gallo blanco is a big reason to enjoy coming to the clarendon.  they make a mean michelada.  throwing dill in there is a great idea, it adds a pickly taste and a bite that just takes the drink to another level.  i guess my only real complaint is that it's a bit overpriced.  i booked the room for 80-some bucks which is, you know, whatever.  that's usually kind of the standard rate for a hotel room in the mid-range, plus it came with a high-def flatscreen tv (no hbo, though).  a lot of high class hotels continue to have shitty tv's in the room and it boggles my mind.  still, when we checked in, there was then a $15 per-night fee that included two bottles of water in the room and snacks at the front desk, which is like... man, couldn't you build that into my hotel room price initially?  so with that and a lodging fee (not including tax) it ended up being over $100.  not nearly as good a price i thought it was going to be when i first booked the room.  this is still a really fun hotel and a place i'd recommend people to stay if they're coming in from out of town.",-1
"i had lunch here again the other day and i realize i was either very high or absolutely starving last time i ate here. this visit i pretty much had the opposite experience. the food was horrible. the salsa had chunks of tomatoes as big as my fist, the burrito was dry and bland. they sat us in a room under a tv and it was so loud we could barely talk. i'll have to go back though... at least give them one more shot..",-1
"ack. i don't know why my brain tells me every once in a while that this place is a good idea.  after spending nearly $30 on my husband, toddler and i, i get irritated that basically a soup and salad buffet is way too expensive.  though they have a good variety of soups, and salads, i can't justify the price.  other items that are available are slices of pizza, sweet potato and baked potatoes, 3 pasta selections hiding in the corner and appear to have been sitting there under the heat lamp for days.  they really need to either cook smaller portions or replenish them every so often instead of leaving it in there to crust up.  they also have muffins and a dessert bar.  again, i don't know why out of all the selections in desert ridge made me chose this place. i'm pretty sure i told myself that i'd never eat here again the last time i was here. so i say it again....i will not eat here again.",-1
"to quickly summarize my feelings of our experience at ruth chris's: thank goodness we had a giftcard that paid for part of our meal! if we had paid full price, my husband and i would have felt more ripped off than we did when we left.  now, we don't mind dropping $145 for a dinner if the food is really good and the atmosphere is amazing. sadly, neither was true at ruth's chris steakhouse.  my husband had the petit filet and shrimp combo for dinner. while he said the shrimp were very good, he said the steak was just ok. definitely not the most amazing steak he has ever ate.  i had the crab cake entree, which was three lump crab cakes. was it worth the almost $30 pricetag? heck no! i appreciated that there was really no filling and it was lump crab meat, it was way way too moist for me.  i don't like my crabcakes bone dry, but i don't like them overly moist. mccormick and schmick's are way too dry, but ruth chris's are way too moist. blah. also, there was too much horseradish or something like along those lines for my taste.  i can't wait to visit my parents in maryland this summer to actually get some good crabcakes.  our mashed potato side that we ordered was large enough for the two of us, but the potatos were meh.  the $1 instant potatoes we buy at fry's are better and have more flavor.  for dessert, we had the cheesecake. i'm sorry to say that the cheesecake at the cheesecake factory is 10x better than what i ate at ruth chris's.  our waiter was very nice...attentive but not overbearing or pushy. the atmosphere was just ok.  we had reservations, but still had to wait almost 20 minutes to be seated...wtf? and for an ""upscale"" restaurant, i was shocked to see people roll in with jeans and sweatshirts on! yuck.  my husband and i said that it is highly unlikely we will ever go back to ruth's chris steakhouse.  high prices do not equal good food.",-1
enjoyed my veggie burger with fries. service sucked the last 2 times. we had to flag down a waitress to get our refills. next time we'll do take out to avoid tipping poor service,-1
"dear holy awesome gluten free menu!!!   i'm 100% excited for a restaurant that's been approved by a celiac association - and they display it right on their door! everything here is awesome - i had the gluten free crush pizza and got the ""vegetarian"" option. i also had the watermelon mojito - with real chunks of watermelon and mint! they have great gluten free appetizers as well!   this is my new favorite restaurant, and although pretty pricey, it's a great date restaurant, or a good girlfriend date. especially for celiacs, vegetarians, or organic junkies.   a must visit!",-1
"i really like the size of this venue.  it's not too big, not too small.  it feels cozy in there.  i have complaints about stadium venues for non-sporting events, because for those events, the arenas are usually more than half empty.  my bro-in-law robert d. took me here to see cedric the entertainer.  we had an incredible time.  we sat right in front, and the view was amazing.  the acoustics were great, and we didn't miss anything due to their perfect setup on the stage.    i've been to a couple of other events here, and each time, we had good experiences.  if you get there early enough, you can even find street parking by the side or behind the place.  the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it is located in a dead zone.  after the show, there really isn't anywhere good you can walk to and hang out at near there.",-1
"i had a burger here, yes a burger at a sushi place kinda weird huh? it was amazing spicy and amazing.  trust me please trust me.",-1
"az88 is located in the civic center plaza in downtown scottsdale.  i've been there a few times for dinner/drinks and have had mixed experiences.  the first time i went it was just for drinks.  it was very crowded, full of the usual snottsdale types (you know, $30,000 millionaires).  but the drinks and service were good, so i was kept occupied.    the last time i went was later in the evening after a concert.  i don't know if the waiter was tired but he just couldn't be bothered to wait on us.  i rarely leave a waiter with a one or two dollar tip, but this was an exception.    the food is nothing to write home about...very typical burgers, salads etc.  and it's always crowded.  i really don't think it's for the food...it's just the place to be and it's very close to the mondrian.  i'd say that the best part of the place is the people watching.  i've never seen so many chickadees working so hard to look and act like paris hilton.  skip it, unless you are desperate for grub or need a good laugh.",-1
"i want to give this place a 1 star rating but my food was actually pretty good.  the service on the other hand was a completely different story.  a couple girl friends and i decided to meet up for dinner on a wednesday night after work.  when we got here it wasn't slammed but it was definitely busier than we expected.  since it was nice outside we wanted a table on the patio and were told it would be a 5-10 minute wait but that we could sit at the bar with a buzzer in the meantime.  the hostess was friendly and helpful.  we get to the bar and make our drink orders right away.  when they were brought out the bartender asked if we wanted to keep a tab or pay as we went.  my friend explained that we were going to be moving outside once a table became available and wanted to know if the tab could be transferred over once we did.  he snapped back that we could do it either way, it was up to us but that it would take longer if we transferred it.  now let me just say that i know reading that line doesn't seem especially rude, but the tone he used was extremely impatient and condescending.  we decided to just pay as we went since it seemed to be such an inconvenience to do anything else.  another thing that apparently bothered him was one of my friends commented that she thought the beer she ordered was supposed to be darker, which she didn't even say to him, she was just commenting on it.  so he grabs a shot glass, pours the beer into it in front of her, slams it down and says, ""see?  that's just what it looks like!""  at this point we were all looking at each other like ""what is wrong with this guy?""  luckily the hostess came over right at that point to let us know our table was ready.  when our waitress came over we already knew what we wanted since we'd been browsing the menus while we waited so we got that out of the way quickly.  we also all got glasses of water.  our food came out after a reasonable amount of time for how busy they were and as i stated above it was all good.  i got the chicken tortilla soup which was nice and thick, had large chunks of chicken in it and was all around a great combination of flavors.  unfortunately  after our food was brought out we didn't see our waitress again for probably 20 minutes.  so we were all sitting around with empty water glasses until she brought our check out.  we were not happy campers.  so while i did enjoy the food i don't think i'll be returning with the prospect of receiving this kind of service again.",-1
"this long series of interconnected parks that runs along the indian bend wash is a good reason for me to buy a bike. here you have a bike path that runs many miles, lots of grass, trees, a stream that connects several ponds frequented by various wading birds, a challenging skateboard area, and other recreational features - most notably disc golf areas. i haven't heard of disc golf until i came here and a disk golfer yelled ""fore!"" at me because i was blocking the path of his frisbee disc while i was trying to photograph the wading and diving birds in one of the ponds (oh yeah - see the pics i took ... woohoo!) this place is quite a schlepp from where i live, but it's worth the drive because i love the scenery here ... and i have a lot of fun using my push scooter on part of the extremely long bike path. i said part, because the bike path runs about 25 miles each way. eventually i'll get around to buying that bike.",-1

"scary things to me: paris hilton has a career.  sarah palin. really. she's like the new anita bryant.  my fathers' overgrown eyebrows. trim, daddy, trim! droves of high schoolers leaving school just as i'm trying to find barrio cafe.   seriously. like thousands of them. and i couldn't find the damn restaurant. what was i gonna do? roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, ""hey, squeeze me fellas, i'm going to a wine tasting at the barrio cafe. y'all know where that is?"" since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me.   finally. i found it. and entered.   cute. cozy. middle of the day, so empty. great, vibrant art. and a very attentive and friendly staff. often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. no ball dropping here. i had la paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. think squirt and patron! and after a couple of these babies i was in el bano squirting out that patron. dee lish however.   i ordered the enchiladas del mar. enchiladas of the sea for my non spanish speaking peeps. you know what? it was good. not great. and the presentation was somewhat messy. i couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). they were lost in the sauce and the cheese. but i devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. my friend had a chickent torta. big and rustic. like janet reno. she loved it!   i will most definitely be back. hopefully i will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl i will pick that barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off.   oh. that's blow my socks off. btw. adios for now mi yelpitas!",-1
