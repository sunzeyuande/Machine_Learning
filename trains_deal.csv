"holy horchata.  i always say, there's no better way to try a beverage for the first time, than to drink an entire gallon of it. and trying the horchata at america's was no exception.   i had no idea what to expect, but immediately fell in love with it. all gallon of it. second best thing to drink, next to beer, with mexican food. so, so good.  the carne asada burrito was one of the best i've ever had. ever. the beef was just so good, tasty, tender, and loads of it. the tortillas were incredible; just right so they didn't take over the burrito, but added to the flavor.  the ceviche was awesome; chopped up like salsa...whatever they do to it works. big time. it's 10:17am and i'd eat a bowl of it now...for breakfast...with milk and a spoon.   i had two different types of salsa and i loved both equally. the only reason i'm giving it 4 starts is that the veggie quesadilla was pretty far below the rest of the food. basically, it was like they put quac, shredded lettuce, and a sliced up cucumber in a tortilla and threw it in the micro. you know how all of those vegetables are all kind of the same color; blah green? that's how i'd describe the taste: blah green.   but everything else was incredible. you can eat like a king for around $20 and by like a king i mean, two burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla, and a couple of horchatas.   next time i'm sitting on the front porch. so all of 7th can watch me feed my face, cookie monster style.",1
"i hate best buy. how dare you even call yourself ""best buy"" when you are nowhere near the ""best buy"" on anything? your prices are inflated to a point that i find offensive and your staff has to be some of the rudest, most entitled (to what, i cannot tell you) group of individuals i've ever met.   was there a couple years back with collin s. to easily get the worst customer service i've ever received while trying to buy a giant hdtv. the main tv salesman straight up refused to help me. i asked for his assistance several times, he ignored me and was just a cocky son of a bitch like helping me was somehow beneath him. it took everything out of me not to unleash a you work for me asshat on him, but somehow i refrained, probably because i am a lady : )  i ended up having to seek a manager who must've slapped his employee upside the head as all of a sudden he stopped being an asshole and was willing to help me. thoughtful of them, don't you think? willing to help me spend $1,000 at their store? that is really just soooo generous of them.  anyways, i do not like best buy. the only best buy i like is in a tiny little town called anderson, south carolina because everyone who works there is polite and i only go there once a year over thanksgiving when i'm in town visiting my grandfather. it's in the middle of nowhere so it is the calmest black friday best buy in the world, i am convinced.  to make a long story short, if you must go to best buy, avoid the one on 20th st & camelback like the plague, and hop on a plane to greenville, south carolina, you'll thank me, i'm certain of it.",0
"my wife and i had dinner here with another couple.  we all had a great time, and loved our food.  we shared two pizzas, and both were great!!  i can't wait to go again, and try other items on the list.  the place has a cool vibe, and great contemporary/modern decor.  as you're pulling up to the parlor, slow down so you don't miss the pull-in for the parking lot.  it comes up on you quickly.",1
"yup, this place is very good.   friendly service... check! fair prices... check! amazing food... check! best lemonade i've ever had... check!  they are also very knowledgeable about their food ingredients, so if you have food allergies or prefer not to indulge in certain ingredients, you will have no problem dining here.  i personally recommend the lamb, it was fantastic.",1
"cabela's store defies any category. if you're at all familiar with the name, you have probably seen a catalog of theirs lying around somewhere on your grandfather's end table. even if you aren't a fan of the outdoors, you're bound to find something of interest (or disinterest) here at cabela's.  inside this massive building you will find anything and everything you need for the outdoors or for the outdoors enthusiast on your shopping list. entire sections are devoted to guns, fishing, archery, camping and more. cabela's is the only store i've been in that has an aquarium full of fish you'd likely encounter in your outdoors excursions. feats of taxidermy are on display. deer, elk, badgers, bobcats, squirrels, animatronic hunters and more. today, i can say i've seen a stuffed and mounted elephant. there is an entire section dedicated to camouflage. i had trouble finding it at first though.  the second floor has household items for your cabin or vacation home, a candy shop and a cafeteria boasting some items you're not likely to find on a typical menu. you can dine on boar, ostrich, and venison or, if you'd rather have a good old hamburger, that's also an option. my friend that i went with opted for the venison bratwurst.   thousands of items from video games to antique guns in the gun library can be purchased. unfortunately, the one item i kept encountering in repeated locations was the official larry the cable guy ball cap with his despicable catch-phrase emblazoned upon it. i am not going to quote it here for fear of being beaten silly if i am ever spotted out in the real world. seriously. i hate that guy.  want to teach your loved ones to use weapons? an indoor shooting range is just the answer you've been looking for. you can also purchase live bait or book one of the conference rooms for your next important meeting. if a boat is on your shopping list, you can easily find one here.  so pack up the family, grab your favorite rifle and fill up the cooler with schlitz so you can head down to cabela's. it's like disneyland for montana freemen.",1
"so i was sitting at home the other day flipping through the tv channels and landed on the food network..weird. it was a bobby flay throwdown for pad thai. after watching the full episode it got me craving the classic dish. i fought off the temptation for two hours (i mean pool season is rapidly approaching ) but finally gave in. so i turned over to my trusty yelp app and tottie's came up as the overall favorite, i can now see why.  so i went for pick up and was greeted straight away. they took my chicken pad thai order (no egg...i know a staple to the dish but i can't stand them) and had it ready within 10 minutes. i went 20 mph over the speed limit the whole way home because the smell was killing me. finally i dug in and it was everything i was looking for. i went with medium spicy and it was perfect. just enough spice compared to sweet. a large portion size for the price and the noodles were perfectly cooked. sorry pei wei you just lost a pad thai customer.",1
"i have been craving indian food lately and after hearing about foi from a coworker and reading the reviews here, i decided to try it out for lunch. ok it is a buffet, i knew that, but i have been to some very good indian buffets. when i walk into any ethnic restaurant and i see people of the same ethnicity of the restaurant eating there i get excited. it must be good right?   this table must have been family and eat for free because i have had better. the naan was just ok, the tandoori chicken, meh (well i have never been a big fan of this anyway because almost anywhere it is usually just dry bland chicken to me). the butter chicken type dish with tomatoes, was ok but looked like they added red food coloring. i enjoyed the flavor of the meatball dish, the palak dish was bland. honestly the only other dish i found interesting other than the meatballs was the carrot ""pudding"" which was sauteed sweet minced carrots, went back twice just for that. the sweet rice was ok, it had raisins and coconut.  i generally prefer it without either.  i may go try it one more time and order off the menu for dinner. give it a fair chance before completely ruling it out.",0
i have to take back my 5 star rating.  this place has slowly been getting worse.  first they took our favorites off the happy hour menu which was the snap peas and asparagus.  next they changed the quality of scallops from really nice big ones to tiny cracked up walmart looking scallops.  the type i find on sale at walmart and would never buy.  they sent me a coupon for my birthday that expired 2 days before my actual birthday so my husband and i gave it another try.  the service was good but the food was lacking.  i made a point of telling my server that i noticed the difference in quality when it came to the scallops on top of the filet mignon oscar.  i asked him to make sure i didnt get the low quality tiny ones so he said something to the kitchen.  they were a little bit better than they have been but still not the quality that i had become used to when dining there.  ordered the filet medium and it came out well done.  first time they ever ruined a steak which really annoyed me but i didnt get a chance to tell the server.  manager came around checking and i just had to tell her the truth.  i told her i cant keep coming back here and justify these prices when the quality is starting to take a dive.  since i had a $25 birthday coupon they took that off as well as the glass of wine that i had.  if i were the manager i would have comped the entire meal happy bday sorry if we didnt meet up to your expectations and to ensure that my customers would return and give us another shot to impress i would give some kind of a coupon to make sure that happened.  at this point i don't think we will be back :-(,0
"it was extremely cold tonight, so jason b. and i wanted to eat something warm. so we decided to go back to cherry blossom for the second time, because we really enjoyed it the first time around.  the second go around confirmed it! this is a great restaurant!  we started with the extremely spicy gyoza pot. which consists of gyoza in an extremely spicy broth! that kind of spicy that makes you talk funny! but the combination of tasty gyoza and the spicy broth was absolutely scrumptious!   for dinner i ordered the nabeyaki udon, iron pot. a well flavored broth with seafood such as, calamari, fish, clams, scallops, and the wonderful thick udon noddles! i like my noodles thick!   if you like ramen, sushi or other types of noodles, cherryblossom is a great choice, there is something for just about everyone.",1
even better now....now with every buffet order they bring you a fresh sizzling platter of tandoori chicken to your table. can this place get any better? my favorite place ever! the staff is super attentive and you are never out of something to drink.,1
"this place kicks major boody!  its new, its huge, its very well stocked, there are various free tastings all the times.   we were the sunday and they had italian wine tasting. with real wine master present, never the less. i tasted and tasted and tasted some more lol probably tasted 1 1/2 glass worth of different italian wines. of course, i bought a bottle too - can not just taste and buy nothing.   their prices are somewhat on the higher end of the spectrum, not as high as aj's of course. but produce seems to be fresh and variety is nice. that theme pretty much goes through entire store.   if i lived really near by i would have gone in there way more often, but for 20 min drive i do not go there too much. all in all, it is great to have such store in the vicinity.  ""i like""",1
"the bar itself, for drinks only, is ok.  it's very alpha-male but ok.....i can live with that.  the food is terrible.  myself and three others ordered different items.  i got the pulled pork...and it was about as good as wendy's.  even the hamburgers were below average.  not just me saying this...three of my buddies as well.  bottom line -- ok for a beer or two but skip the food for sure.",0
"2 stars for now. i know they just opened but...  first of all, a star for the decor and ambiance. it's so cute and colorful and comfy! we were worried there would be a wait (the place seemed packed) but were able to snag a spacious booth overlooking the kitchen. this may seem like a great idea, but i was able to watch food get sent back (3 different meals in the time we waited for ours) and see how long certain plates were left under hot lamps. being able to watch the kitchen in action is neat in theory, but if you're well-versed in the ways of restaurant life, you'll catch these problems easily.  another star for service. our server was sweet but slow...because i think she was overwhelmed. she would disappear for long stretches (as in, i couldn't find her in the whole place) and it took forever for coffee refills because they were out of glasses. again, i don't fault her at all. i think that she must have been slammed. every table in the place was taken.  the food? well. i ordered the scottsdale burrito, and subbed cheddar for the goat cheese. instead, it came with no cheese. the menu promised hash browns inside the burrito...and they were, and they were frozen shreds with no crisp or color to them. they blended in with the egg whites. dammit.  boyfriend ordered the odelay scramble, with a microscopic amount of chorizo. his side of breakfast potatoes was tasty, at least. why couldn't they put those potatoes in the burrito? everything was just underwhelming.   the place has a gigantic breakfast and lunch menu...maybe scale back and focus on making a smaller amount of items, but doing them really well? we both agreed we'd give them one more shot if we're in the area and only if there isn't a wait. otherwise, there are just too many solid breakfast places in scottsdale.",0
"this place got really good reviews so we decided to give it a try.  i don't know if we just ordered the wrong stuff or the sushi chef was having a bad day or what but i really didn't think their rolls were all that good.  we ordered a few rolls from their happy hour menu: philadelphia, crunch, california and some sort of shrimp/avocado roll.  the rice was dry and had no flavor!  i think they forgot the vinegar!    we also ordered the following:  edamame: i've never seen so many of the beans out of its pod!  it tasted about par with other places though.  gyoza: i always thought they were different (but similar) to chinese dumplings but here, it was exactly like a chinese dumpling.  tasted ok.  veggie fried rice: they used really sticky (i'm assuming sushi) rice to make it.  i wouldn't mind it so much if i wanted sticky rice but we ordered fried rice ... usually the rice is a lot looser.  miso soup: really bland and i am one who usually prefers bland food.  seaweed salad: by far my favorite.  at other places it's usually a huge salad entrée so it was nice they had a small side of it i could order.  great flavor.  perfection.  i would at least give this place a try again.  i just can't imagine this place getting such good reviews but the sushi tasting the way it did.  i can only assume it was an off day.  the service was good though and they have booth seats which is always a plus when you  have a toddler!  on the (far) west side, my barometer for good sushi is usually comparing the new place i try to tomo's off of dysart/mcdowell, the japanese food restaurant we frequent most.",0
"sabai thai has become my new go-to place. i absolutely love the dishes, the service, the ambiance, and the overall experience!  this wendy's converted building is quite deceiving. the inside is beautifully modernized and offers a nice, clean, upscale, and accommodating atmosphere. at night, when the lights go down and the candles are lit, sabai thai is a perfect spot to take a date.   they have an excellent happy hour, but their normal drink prices are incredibly reasonable as well. i can't tear myself away from the $4 bottle of sake ($1 off beers/spirits and $5 glasses of wine on hh). i generally sit up at the bar to shoot the shit, but happy hour is good throughout the restaurant.   as far as food is concerned, i am absolutely addicted to the lettuce wraps (tofu easily substituted) and the classic yellow curry, but the sabai fried rice and the eggplant dish are delicious as well.   the staff is incredibly friendly, especially chris and the owner eric who you can see bopping around from table-to-table making sure the guests are taken care of. his wife, holly, mans the back of the kitchen and together they have created the perfect modern thai environment.  in additional to the great atmosphere, delicious high-quality food, great drink prices, outstanding happy hour, warm and attentive service, they also have great hours, especially for an asian restaurant. most thai places close from 3-5 and don't do sunday lunch service. sabai thai's modern take grants us thai lovers action all day long, 7 days a week!  i think even mr. sheen would agree, sabai thai is a winner!!!",1
"had the chicken, potato and rosemary pizza, it was kind of bland. friend had the spaghetti and meatballs and said it was nothing spectacular. pizookie (don't know what they call it here but its a cookie pizza) was the best part. we came right before the dinner rush and as people started trickling in they wanted us out. no refilled water glasses.   food is nothing special, kind of over priced, service was rushed. won't be returning probably.",0
"i was teetering between 2 and 3 stars until i looked at the yelp definition that reads ""meh. i've experienced better."" i had the cheeseburger and wasn't too impressed. i also had the pretzel appetizer which was okay. even though the service was good, i don't see my self running back to this place. $30 dollars before tip for two cheeseburgers, two sodas and a pretzel appetizer. the server just gave me the credit card receipt without the detail of items ordered and charged. the only saving grace was that this meal was charged to the company credit card.",0
"sure, the prices on some items seem decent and there are some good finds available.    however, in addition to much of the furniture being suited for a flat in europe, the instructions in the boxes are pretty vague.  the items are not even numbered and there are not any written explanations for assemblage.  you kind of have to guess what the pictures are trying to communicate as if you are interpreting artwork from the stone age.",0
"2 out of 4 people got seriously ill after mothers day dinner. no compensation. manager inferred  we must have eaten something else that day. no, no dr keg i did not.not that i ever want to eat here again. veggies hard as rocks. i don't know what you people are eating but this place stinks.",0
"yum yum yum yum yum!!!   i love it. and kinda wish i never found it! the ice cream sandwiches are to die for! the kitchen sink cookies are a spin off of what some might recognize as 'compost' cookies... basically the remenants of what a baker would typically have in their cabinet. sometimes that will include chocolate chips, coffee grinds, pretzels, chips, butterscotch, nuts, etc. (on a side note, momofuku in new york is the man when it comes to executing this to perfection). . . but i must say churn does a great job on these cookies and everything else i have had there. i am a fan of the ice cream sandwiches with said cookie and madagascar vanillla and vietnamese coffee smooshed in between.   i love it. and i will continue to piss off my diet by coming back.",1
"so when my friend kevin and i are looking for a beer fix, this is usually where we head. they have decent deals on pitchers and oh so edible salsa (personally i like the hot version) but that is where the love affair ends. and even though we have gone to this spot several times, i wouldn't say that either one of us are fans. we go for the convenience.  i've tried several items on the menu and have to say i've never been particularly impressed with any of them. that's a nice way of saying i've never had anything here that wasn't done better somewhere else. i have spent years learning the nuances of what makes a good mexican plate and if you are looking for something authentic, this wouldn't be my first choice. on the other hand if you are happy with an americanized version and in need of cheap beer, definitely check it out!",0
american junkie advertised no cover and open bar from 8pm-10pm for nye. there was a small line when we arrived but it wasn't moving. the door man said they were only checking in bottle service customers and they will let the general public in at 11pm. we asked about their open bar promotion and they said if we want to get in we have to pay $60. we were very unhappy with their customer service and happily went somewhere else that charged a cover but treated their customers with respect. firehouse and the lodge are better options if you are looking for a casual bar in old town scottsdale.,0
"thank you yelp for my first opportunity to enjoy gammage.  impressive architecture and design (it is also mostly functional)!   the seats are roomier than expected and the rows have just enough room between them to allow people to pass relatively easily in front of you without having to stand up to let them through.[relative to us airways center seats which outside of lexus club and courtside seats are several inches narrower than the ones at gammage and you have to stand up every time someone needs to pass.] having the room to pass easily is nice, especially if you are seated in the middle of the auditorium, since you have to pass in front of at least 30 people just to get to your seat if your, say, running late or need to escape to the restroom.   this is also a negative especially if you are the crowd-fearing  or clostrophobic type, there are not good ""outs"" from the center.    i think it is wonderful to have a location that hosts wonderful broadway performances and a variety of other artistic entertainment/performances.",1
"the food was good, the vibe was also good.  ** except there was a very unfriendly older lady taking my order. she seemed a bit annoyed and was just not pleasant nor warm. *** however, i will give it a second try at their frank lloyd wright location soon!!!.  hopefully they'll be a bit more friendly there!!! i've heard wonderful things about this restaurant from co-workers, so i wouldn't want to give up just because i had a not-so delightful first impression.  :)",0
"thinking about going here for a before-show dinner some evening?  you might want to think again.  gertrude's is set up as a fine dining restaurant but it falls short in lots of ways.  first: ambiance -- gertrude's is located near the entrance to the desert botanical garden in an area that used to be part of the gift shop.  it still looks like an empty retail space with tables and chairs arranged in rows.  besides having the warmth of a high school cafeteria, gertrude's is incredibly noisy.  strike one. note: there is also a more inviting outside dining area if the weather is cool enough.    second: service -- the kitchen is way too slow.  we arrived almost an hour and a half before our show time to find a 1/3-filled restaurant.  our server asked if we had to get out in time for a show and we told her.  thirty minutes later our appetizers arrived.  thirty-five minutes after that i was ready to walk out because there was scarcely time left to eat before our show.  our server kept telling us just a few more minutes.  in the end we got our main courses barely in time to eat them, and certainly with no time for dessert.  strike two.  third: food - spotty.  for example, the pork trio had delicious thinly-sliced leg, but the sausage was blank and the pork loin dried out.  the short ribs were blah.  the burrata appetiser was very small for the price, and the bread (you need to order it separately for about $6) was a berry loaf of some kind that didn't work well with anything else we ordered.  that's right - no free bread.  strike three.  good points:  the price was halfway reasonable for fine dining.  too bad this wasn't fine dining, which is after all about a total experience and not just the food.  a couple of the items we were served were very tasty.  the desert botanical garden itself is fabulous.  that's about it.  sorry.",0
"i'm a huge fan of costco. recently i've started using their pharmacy. i have monthly thyroid meds i've been paying $8.99 at the grocery store for, well costco did it up for a 3 month supply at $11.99!!  now this costco has something no other costco has. they are the country's test store for a self check out process. it's pretty cool and easy to use with someone standing right there to walk you thru it. basically you scan your costco card and then get a hand held machine to scan all your buys with. they even thought ahead to put a holder for the machine on all the grocery carts. theres a dedicated are for you to check out (much quicker). the only downside to the process is theres no boxes nearby to make carrying your stuff into the house.",1
"i think it's awesome that vintage 95 only serves beers from arizona breweries - way to support the local team!  when i found this place on my yelp app, i naturally assumed i'd be getting some wine but i couldn't resist trying the epicenter from san tan brewery, holy mackerel - is this a delicious beer!   to eat - i had the warm brie with apricot, hummus, grilled flat bred.  it was an appetizer but it was the perfect size for a quick lunch time bite.  i can't wait to go back and try some other menu items and hopefully try some wines as well  this beautiful gem has my full endorsement and i'll be bringing everyone i know here, well... the well-behaved ones anyway.",1
"i am sorry , but what can you say about this place other than it sucks!   it is the absolute worse place in the valley. 20 of went to this dump under the lie they had advertised that they were having an italian festival.   the 7th annual!!!   lies..false advertising...what did they really have???? a crap place passing off the italian food that they serve under normal days.   no live music as promised, what was the live music that they would have from 1 to 3 ?? a single accorian player.   nothing else,, is that really anyone's idea of an italian festival??  i never really get this angry about something. but, lying and leading people in the wrong direction does not sit well with me. it was hard to find parking in downtown chandler as it was...nothing even italian about this place.  don't ever waste your time or hard earned money here!",0
"i admit.  i have an ""in"" to these brownies.  i had several boxes of fairytale brownies mailed to my home a while back as part of my college alumni club dealings. long story, but my duty at that time was to acquire an alum donation (yes a donation) of, you guessed it - fairytale brownies.  well, damn them. to hell.   turns out the ceo of fairytale brownies is a fellow alum.  fight on! i would love to meet her to tell her what a genius she is.   each bite-sized ""sprite"" package comes in several wonderfully addictive flavors. despite their plastic-wrapped appearance, they are ever so soft, chocolatey and decadent.  my personal favorites are the chocolate chip and the toffee.  it was one of the more trying episodes with willpower to have just one of these brownies and not devour an entire box -- cardboard and all.  my alma mater thanks me.  and so does my waistline.",1
"i want to like this place.  i really do.  it's near by, it's local, it's efficient, and it's reasonably priced and seems to be a holdover against the big chain burger guys.  it's just not that great.  while the fries were thicker cut - several were burned.  my burger's most prominent taste was charcoal, and i'm not talking about that delicious char grilled taste - i mean nasty petroleum tasting burned charcoal.  i may go back again, but with significantly lowered expectations.",0
"the toucan sam routine somehow led us to the rusty spur. wandering around old town scottsdale, we detected a whiff of barbecue smoke that was hard to locate. nonetheless, we were due for a cold beer, spotted some characters smoking outside of this bar, heard the live music, and trotted on in.  the crowd was a real mixed bag which made for some great people-watching. the dictionary definition of ""sweaty betty"" was cutting a rug to the country western sounds of the psychobilly rodeo band. the band was infinitely entertaining and did not spare us commentary on its disdain for kenny chesney and other feel-good country-pop monstrosities.  best of all, our need for edible smoke was satisfied since they sell beef jerky at the bar. we chowed down on some mesquite black canyon jerky, swaggled our brewskis, tapped our feet, and soaked up the party atmosphere of this fun little cowboy bar.",1
"really? i have been here twice and my main meals were terrible. dry and flavorless, blah. i emailed  tthe owners a long detailed experience at their establishment. they thought i was a critic for a magazine. i said nope just a foodie who experienced terrible service and food. they gave me a free meal and guess what?  it was worse than the first time. we asked for a glass of wine and got a bottle. no bread, no water.  this place sucks!! i will never go back. not sure the hype here. maybe both my times were bad? no, i don't think so. i would be reluctant to spend my money there a third time to make sure it was not a fluke. i guess i just have a bit more sophisticated pallet than the chef. they must not taste their own food. dry, flavorless, under seasoned and boring after the 3rd bite. i could barely get through the meal and had to ask for olive oil just to add moisture to my piece of pork. yuk! no thanks people. i have had way way way better!",0
less expensive food if that is what you are looking for. happy hour has some good items but most are fried. not that there is anything wrong with that!,0
"this is a new wine, beer, and spirits store in the valley, though they have over fifty stores throughout the nation!    the wines are categorized by region, type, and in price.  the store even has a section where the store rep's have selected the highest rated wines for your consideration.  each wine is well represented with a label in front of them explaining the type of wine, character and quality of the wine you are viewing.  when there is a rating given on the label, who rated the wine is also given..ie: wine enthusiast, parker, etc.,,,    there are wine tastings for which you should call to get the details as to when.    this store also sells hard liquor, cigars, and beer of incredible variety!  it should not disappoint!  i was impressed with the selections of everything they carried.  it is like a costco of booze!---lol      pricings on wines range from inexpensive to ""where's your checkbook?!""  i saw a bottle of krug champagne for $998.00 yet there were champagnes for as little as $7.00....bring your aspirin!    all in all, this place rocks!------aaa+++!!!----salute!  and  cheers!",1
"delicious.  attentive and courteous service, quaint location, and did i mention - delicious???  thus far i've only been here for a javelina leap wine dinner, and normally i'd reserve judgement until i'd had a meal or two off the menu.  in this the deliciousness factor wins out and i'm going with 5 stars.  the dishes here are a perfect example of completely unexpected combinations of ingredients blending harmoniously to achieve...well... deliciousness.",1
"even in the 110 degree weather, i do not mind waiting underneath the misters to grab some grub at oreganos.  okay, maybe that is a bit of a stretch, but just drink a few beers and your table should be ready.  the thin crust pizza is worth the wait...a reasonable wait, that is.  but the pizookie (huge deep-dish cookie topped with ice cream) is probably worth the unreasonable waits that haunt this pizza joint.  oreganos is definitely a valley treat and they cover the italian basics better than most.",1
"this is one of the very few chain restaurants i like...  tried this new location on saturday night (they recently moved into a new bigger building next door).   melting pot is an adventure in dining, a prolonged multi-hour dinner experience. i love fondue, and the melting pot are the masters of fondue!  started with cheese, apples, breads, and veggies with a cheddar cheese and beer concoction. moved on to lobster, shrimp, steak, pork, and chicken which we cooked in a veggie broth. finished the meal with a chocolate and peanut butter dip with cheesecake, strawberries, and rice crispy treats.  great service, great food, great wine list, great times!",1
"seasons 52 has a secret vegan menu! it's not particularly extensive, but at least they're aware that vegans are, in fact, not just the stuff of legend. they offer choices like ponzu-glazed tofu, cranberry almond tabouli, and farmer's market-esque vegetable penne. go you, seasons 52, go you.   on an unrelated-but-equally-positive note, michael was the best waiter known to man (honestly, i usually don't even notice restaurant staff), and i'd like to thank him for helping my boyfriend ask me to prom via a shot glass of rocky road cake. high fives all around.",1
"i love to see a concert here. it's pretty intimate for a general admission place, you can go up to the front and get up close to the rock stars. i've seen a lot of metal bands here, static x, type o negative, buckcherry, nonpoint, and ween. i'm still ticked at myself for not going to see nin and alice in chains there.  if you like to go to a concert and actually move around and get into the music, it's really fun. if you like have your own seat and just clap at the end of each song then you should head to dodge theater.  on a cool side note, i met my wife for the first time there.",1
"decided to pop in and get takeout for lunch today and holy cow, i'm blown away. now i will say that the actual restaurant seemed cold and unfinished, but the food was killer! they were out of a few of the sides, but at the end of the day my meal was spectacular!!!! i went with the brisket sandwich with a side of seasonal vegetables. now these weren't any regular vegetables, they actually cooked them in the smoker!! it was zucchini, mushrooms and peppers. super great, perfectly cooked! my brisket sandwich was one of, if not, the best bbq sandwich i've ever had period! the bark on the brisket was spectacular, nice spicy dry rub on the meat. the brisket itself was super tender and had that killer beef flavor you expect from a slow cooked brisket. the bbq sauce was a bit strange, but was pretty good. the sandwich didn't need it at all, super killer sandwich. overall there were some minor things i'd change but hey, they're a new restaurant!!! killer bbq spot on central phoenix. way to go guys!!! (now go put up some decorations will ya?)",1
"dear black cat,  can you pretty, pretty please move to my neighborhood? or make another location in scottsdale? i'd just love it. thanks!  boyfriend and i happened upon black cat a few months ago. we were starving and on our way to a fun- and monkey-filled day at the zoo and tried to stop in at over easy. the line was out the door and we were reaching hangry levels. on a whim (like i'm sure a lot of people), we decided to try out luck next door at this cute little coffee house.  hello, breakfast sandwiches.  huge, fluffy eggs. buttery croissants. thick cut tomatoes. assorted meats for him. tasty, gooey cheese for both. add a huge, slightly chocolatey iced coffee for each of us and it was love at first sight.  we've returned twice since then, the latest being this morning. we just love this place. all employees we've talked to are so nice (the first time we got a punch card, and they gave us double punches. weeee!) and both food and drink product is so, so stellar. we don't live very close but when we are in the area, black cat is it!",1
"my brother and i came to 5th and wine once, and it was pretty decent...especially the fried pickles...so when i was on a date and my date informed me he hadnt been to 5th and wine yet, i suggested we go for a drink. oh my word. what a heinous experience transpired next. we were treated like criminals, and my date never got his drink. here goes:  so we walk in and find some seats at the bar, and take a look at the menu. the bartender came over and informed us of a new date-night promotion they are running, and then left us to the menu. when she came back, i ordered the lafitte brut and my date asked her ""how is your sangria?"" and the bartender responded ""red or white?"" and he then said ""red"". and then the bartender walked away. my date and i looked at each other very confused. then we figured, the bartender must not have heard him correctly yada yada...anyhow, my date mentioned that they allegedly have this great patio yada yada and asked if i would join him on the patio for a moment so he could check it out. so i look at the bartender, and make eye contact, and point towards the patio to signal her that we were going outside for a second, and she nods in understanding. we get out to the patio and we were chatting for a moment when the manager comes out and asks ""is everything ok?"". she looked at me like i was doing something wrong. and i said ""oh yes, everything is fine, we just wanted to check out your patio"". the manager then walks back in and immediately returns with one of the male bartenders in tow. the bartender comes out and very confrontationally says ""is there a problem out here?"". both my date and i were quite taken with the way the bartender addressed us, and futhermore the fact that the manager felt it was necessary to bring one of the male bartenders out to address us after i had already told her we just wanted to see the patio. my date suggested that we go back inside and check things out some other time, while the manager and the bartender looked at us like we were trying to ditch on our bill or something. upon walking back inside, the manager asked me if we were thinking of booking a private party on the patio. (well sheesh lady if i was i certainly i certainly am not anymore!) i once again informed the manager that we just wanted to see the patio.   we got back inside, and my glass of lafitte was waiting. his sangria was no where to be found. i took one sip, it was bitter, or maybe just my taste buds were. i paid for my drink and we left. the only reason i even think of giving this place anything above one star is because the fried pickles were good the first time around. i have no idea why we were treated so aggressively when trying to see the patio. so go ahead and order yourself some fried pickles. just dont try and take your date out on the patio.   you have been warned.",0
"could have been a 2 star rating because of the cleanliness, but realized that another chain burger joint charging $10 for an average burger didn't deserve it, especially when the burger is served with a side of sarcasm. not to mention that they are not community friendly at all. i asked to drop some flyers for the grand avenue festival and they said no, not that they needed to say yes, but when i asked the manager to talk with the franchise managers about being a little more community involved and supportive; the manager barked very rudely ""none of the businesses around here do that""; which was a lie because just next door on college- port of subs and the cupz coffee both allow people to leave flyers for their customers, so did the hawaiian place and almost every other business around. i had to give this a 1 star because arizona doesn't need another over priced, community sucker, who is not interested in creating a community, but just bleeding the money and running. he was so unfriendly and sarcastic that i didn't even want to place my order after that. i'll stick with maizie's burgers anyday! i also heard the grind on camelback rd  next to the fenix eatery at about 40th street was the shiznitz! they said its hands down the best in town....on my way soon.",0
"scrum diddly!  2 of us ate for $21  i had the red chile w cheese-- added the lettuce, sour cream, onion and tomatoes.   we split the honey/powdered sugar fry bread.   tons of food! friendly and quick service. hard to find, literally right off stapley in an odd shopping plaza. don't let that deter you!  it is nothing fancy, just yummy food!!",1
"if you are looking for a fancy place... you better go somewhere else.  if you want great food and great service, come on in.  i was not a big fan of thai food until i met touch of thai. it is a big favorite of people in my office. we usually order the same stuff (soup, catfish and red or yellow curry chicken).  their lunch portions are reasonable size and price.  they are very friendly and don't make faces if you ask them to split the check, even for big parties.  once i ordered lunch to go and i forgot it at the table : ( they took it off my bill the next time i was there : )",1
"i used to be a huge fan of this place, but it was just ok this time around..  a bunch of us went and i ordered their steak for two.. 22oz. thought it might be good.  it was dry and had no flavor.  she had asked at the beginning ""do you guys want a-1?""  i said ""no thanks.""  a good steak shouldn't need any sauce.  i should have asked for a ton of it.. just ugg..  we also got their artichoke, which was actually not too bad.  i love the one they do at cheesecake  factory. if you combine both, you have the ultimate smoked artichoke.    everyone was ok with their meal and one of my friends loved his.  he got the chicken fried steak.  cant really mess that up i guess.  it was pretty good.   id go back, but im not the fan i used to be of this place.",0
"tasty tiny tacos that are inexpensive in a very no frills repeat very no frills   atmosphere. you order at the counter and they run the food to you. between us we tried four different ones that were all seasoned differently. they were all tasty and good. the fish ones came on a very thin fresh tasting flour tortilla and the others came on double stacked corn tortillas .i heard they are oaxaca style. i tried to find out what oaxaca is but the only information i found was that grasshopper tacos are popular in oaxaca and mole sauces are popular there. i've had real street tacos on the streets in mexico but they were jalisco and did differ in taste so i can't compare them . they gave us small sides of thin avocado based sauce , green salsa , grilled onions and an inedible super hot roasted chili pepper that looked like a serrano to me but might have been a jalapeño. unfortunately my husband took a bite out of the pepper and started hiccuping. i just tasted without eating the tiniest piece and my lips swelled up like balloons because it really was that hot . the pinto beans were very runny like soup but tasty and had an unexpected cheese surprise at the bottom of the dish.  a bottled water five tacos and a side of beans was less than $12. before tip.  3.75 stars",1
"this is a great restaurant if you're a fan of chinese food.  i seem to gravitate around the spicey dishes, like chicken and beef.  on their menu, the spicey dishes have a little red chili pepper next to the dish.  their soups are very good, too.  i tend to go there for lunch because i work near the state capitol, so i'm not sure what the menu looks like at dinner time.  the prices are very reasonalbe, but if you do go there for lunch, go early!!  the place really fills up, and there is not much off-street parking.  after noon time, there are always people waiting to be seated.  years ago, this restaurant was located on central avenue in a little, tiny brick building painted bright pink in color.  they lost their lease in that former location, and the building was torn down, so they didn't exist for about a year and a half.  finally, they reopened at their current location at 3rd street and flower.  i'm glad they returned!!",1
"we visited just to see the chihuly exhibit.  the traveling display had been to phipps conservatory in pittsburgh and i thought was would be great to see it in the desert.  it was more amazing than i could have imagined.  first off, i did not realize that there were so many different types and species of cactus.  i wish i was a local, because i would love to be able to sign up for their desert landscaper school.  that would be amazing!!  the lay out and the trails are very nice.  and i can't believe that i am typing this, but the different types of cactus are so beautiful!!  i must have taken a gajillion photos!  also, we happened to go just before sunset, so it was very nice to wander around the gardens after dark.  plus, the chilly glass looks amazing all lit up.  a must see in phoenix!",1
"bee-u-tiful resort! the hype is true. very pricey, but if one can afford it, you definitely get what you pay for!",1
"they're slipping something fierce.  one of their best dishes is the fish taco, which i got just over a week ago.  yesterday however the fish came out extra stinky (old fish), and they tried to cover it up by making it super salty.  now i have to find a new mexican sit down restaurant.  :/",0
"i have a lot of the same things to say.  celebrity is old but has a nice circular stage and great acoustics.  dodge is nice and more expensive but a great place to see a concert.  my beef with marquee has always been that it is a cheap warehouse and it is a bit of a dump.  seeing a concert at a dump can have value too if it has some history or just a cool ambiance/environment.  marquee has none of the above.  i will say that the ketel one tonics were stiff and the bartender was responsive.  otherwise, it's pretty hot because the doors are open and they have a couple of large fans inside and that's about it.  many bands sound somewhat marginal there because the acoustics are just not very good.  however, the concert we saw this week sounded very good so that was a nice suprise.  i usually go to rock n roll shows if that gives you and idea of the type of music and the volume.  loud.  gotta love it.",0
"a complete insult to italian cuisine. the calamari was fairly decent however only served with some trashy ranch dressing.. and that's where the good ends... the green tea had no flavor. the ciabatta bread was cold. not room temp. out of a refrigerator cold! i ordered a special this evening... pasta with breaded shrimp with their specialty ""sunrise"" sauce (marinara/alfredo mixed together)... the sauce tasted like baby food, and the pasta combined with it tasted like water. the shrimp were a good size but there were only a few, considering the $16.95 price... (also, for this price, soup or salad should be included. not $2.00 more. the shrimp were overcooked and  i bit into one and had to spit it out into my napkin... something i never ever do regardless of how something tastes.. it had a foul strong fishy taste that was just absolutely nauseating. i alerted the waitress to this and she seemed concerned but offered nothing in compensation. my family members ordered other non-impressive meals.. the vito's italian sausage sandwiches were also cold, and had      slimy boiled peppers in onions.  my dad's chicken picatta looked like it was made with frozen-in-a-bag chicken breasts from the grocery store.. again, absolutely insulting considering the menu price. waitress was unpleasant and visibly angry about something going on with her co-workers.  completely unprofessional. let's hope that foul shrimp doesn't come back to haunt me in a few hours!",0
"went here for a friends birthday. they have a nice outside patio. that you can reserve. great options for sandwiches & wine. i absolutely love these types of places where it's a deli but also a great little shop with crazy jams, sauces, teas & cookwares.",1
"my #1 gripe with this place is the prices they charge.  $10 for your run of the mill sandwich - no side dishes or drinks or anything.  how many meal deals could i get at subway for 10 bucks?! because they don't taste much better...  their menu listed ""gourmet hot chocolate"" and since this place looked like a cute little cafe, i was expecting something at least on-par with starbucks mediocre version. not even close. it was a powdered mix and hot water!! bleh.  thankfully for me, the girl didn't make it correctly (uhhh?) the first time around, but i told her not to worry about it once i knew it was just nesquick and water.  the coffee was also boring. they forgot the avocado on both of our sandwiches.  2 boring sandwiches and 2 boring coffees cost  us $27.   walking around their property is lovely and we snuck some bites of fresh pecans off their trees!  but, i was extra disappointed when i strolled by morning glory cafe and saw that their prices were cheaper than my  sandwich! i would have much rather eaten there and i think i will in the future because the area is so beautiful.   i would love to visit the farm again, but will never eat at the kitchen again.",0
"i had lunch here with a coworker. i ordered the humdinger, really just because i wanted to say it. it was underwhelmingly average...nothing really stood out for me. it was busy, the service was average and the thick bread sandwich was similar to schlotzsky's.  i could go again or i could skip it. it was just okay for me, dog.",0
"yelp doesn't lie! i was pretty apprehensive about trying this place due to the reviews below, but i had received a $20 discount coupon in the mail which pretty much equaled out to a free dinner for my husband and i. i went in with an open mind and tried to put the bad reviews aside.  the menu seems to be a mix of asian and mexican, due to my lactose issue we decided to go with two asian dishes of pad thai and mongolian beef. we put in our order, and i swear about 6 minutes later our food was out. this is not necessarily a bad thing, but just struck me as odd. are the dishes made to order? if so, how could they be cooked so fast, and it's not like we were the only patrons in the place, the restaurant was somewhat busy when we were there. anyway, this didn't affect the taste of our food.  as for the food; portion size was on the smaller size compared to other asian restaurants i've been to. both dishes had decent flavor but the sauce was just really sugary, it would've been much better if they just dialed back the sweetness. after finishing our dishes it was decided that while the meal wasn't bad per se, it just wasn't a good value. it pretty much tasted like pei wei, and i could get both dishes at pei wei for half the price with bigger portions. or if i wanted to real thing, i would just go to wild thaiger or szechuan palace. i would probably only return again if i had another $20 coupon.",0
friendly service even though the servers' outfits are a little bit over the top.  nice cold beers on tap.  got a chicken wrap to be a little healthier and it was surprisingly tasty.,1
"parking:  it sucks, deal with it, it isn't as bad as some places.  decor:  come on people it's about the food, the place is clean and the chairs are comfy.  service:  well, i've always gotten pretty good service, they can be slow on the bill and sometimes they disappear, but in general i order, get my drinks, get my food and that's about all.  food:  it's awesome, it's hot, it's new mexican chili's!!!!  i love the green chili pork, i also get a side of sour cream to cool my mouth, but i think it is perfect!  the drinks are strong, the deserts are really good, i don't need much more out of a restaurant.    don't have super high expectations, understand the food is spicy, and be prepared to be wowed!",1
"what an awesome store: it's got so much cool stuff, the staff is extremely  friendly and helful and it's right next door to retro ranch and two hippies! i'd love to come back here any time, it's the perfect place to find a funky and unique gift for a friend, or special someone. i ended up buying a vintage hello kitty piggy bank and an old timey card. it's a long story but the piggy bank broke on the way home...im sure that if i'd been able to give it to that special someone of mine she'd have loved it. hmmmph oh well. should i decide to work up the courage to buy her another potential gift i would definitely consider coming back to go kat go. color me a fan!",1
"i love everything about crescent ballroom, and i wish every band in phoenix came through here. seriously. everything is great. perfect. awesome. i love crescent!!!",1
"here this afternoon to try the eggs benedict with spam! that's right spam! oh yeah, it was pretty darn good.  although my dish was good some minor improvements can be made to make it perfect; toast the muffin more, mine was hardly toasted at all and the hollidase sauce needs a little more pizzaz, it was on the bland side.   overall, i really like the food here, both brunch and dinner, love the location and atmosphere, great patio, and pretty decent servers.   ps. dog friendly patio!",1
"i've wanted to check out pho thanh for quite a while now based on on the yelp reviews.  unfortunately, i wasn't blown away.  the interior of the restaurant is very unexpected -- larger and brighter than expected.  the pho, on the other hand, was a let down. the broth is very greasy!  i mean, very greasy!  that's a huge turnoff for me.  i also think it lacked flavor, as i found myself having to continuously add things to it to make it flavorful.  also, the spring roll was just kind of bleh.  i've definitely had better.  next time i'll just make my way down to maxim.",0
"tanzy is a great option for a nice dinner, special occasion, or night out.  i've been there a few times for dinner, each time being a celebration.  i opted for tanzy on my own birthday, when asked to choose a restaurant.  i haven't tried many of their cocktails, but the few i have tasted were top notch.  i hear they have a great happy hour.  i know they have a great wine list, and you can see their collection of bottles in one of the unique walls around the room.  as far as non-alcoholic beverages go, their iced tea is fruity but not too sweet, and pleases our resident tea-lover of the group.    for an appetizer, you can't go wrong with the table-side mozzarella.  a very knowledgeable cheese artist (not sure if that's an official title) comes by and entertains with cheesy skills, and the occasional cheesy joke.  the cheese itself, served with prosciutto and figs or pesto and tomatoes and adorned with one or two of your choice of gourmet salts, never disappoints.  nobody has yet to order an entree that didn't ""wow"", but i have to say the short ribs are particularly popular.    service is always excellent, and i think we talk about the decor with every visit.  atmosphere and attitude top off this experience like the cherry in the brownie sundae (although the red velvet bread pudding is my personal fave).  i can't wait to go back!",1
"can i get a sweet jesus or even a hell ya!!! best hot dog i have ever had!!!  this place is super cute! i love the way it's set up, very open, fits a ton of people, cute little patio out front, they have a convenient drive through and have a great mix of old school/chicago decor, set up in a modern way (if that makes any sense)  the menu is larger then i thought it would be there are salads, hamburgers, chicken sandwiches and of course hot dogs!! i decided to go with the jumbo chili dog, cheese fries and a drink! wish i had room for dessert, or a chocolate shake! definitely going to order that next time! a lot of places over cook hot dogs, or have awful tasting chili they pile on top. it's nice to actually get a perfectly cooked/juicy hot dog, on a delicious seasoned bun, with flavorful chili! ohhh and the fries! i love crinkle fries.... a lot of places stopped serving them! portillos hit home with me with the crinkle fires! nice and crispy, crunchy, the way crinkle fries should taste!  overall great experience! this place is very laid back, casual, family and date friendly! the staff is very courteous and welcoming! worth the lines and the kayos! i recommend going later at night around 9pm is when we went (i know that is late to eat) but there were no lines, received our food in about 5 minutes, sat and enjoyed each others company while people watching and took the long drive home!  this specific location is about and hour away from my house, but certainly worth the drive! i can't wait for them to open up their new location this summer at tempe market place!  great night! thanks for finally making it to az portillos!",1
"rock bottom indeed. at least that is the level of service you can expect at this location.  we went with our usual girls night out crew and sat outside on the patio. we sat for 15 minutes before a server even came over which was ok since we were chatting but we sure got thirsty. a server came over and asked if we had been helped yet and when we said no she said she was likely not going to be our server, but she'd take our drink order. turns out, she was our server for the night. we could have done better serving ourselves at that rate. it took another 12 minutes to get our drinks. so yes, we were there 27 minutes before a beverage hit our table. not a good start but this was my friend's choice as it was her birthday so i didn't complain.   ultimately, it took our party of 5 more than 2 hours to eat dinner at rock bottom. we had 3 different appetizers which we took advantage of the happy hour prices. we had to remind the server that we were to get the 1/2 price appetizers when she brought our check. we had to beg for refills of drinks, ask where our dinners were, and it was like pulling teeth to get service. the food was ok at best but really the service was so horrible that i wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy.    save yourself the hassle. there are plenty of places who do want your business enough to treat you right. it's funny too because the place was packed. they won't be packed with us anymore. we dropped over $130 there. never again.",0
"dick's is one of my top 5 all time favorite restaurants.   the ambiance - intimate, dark, rustic, wood, copper.   sitting at the bar, watching your food being cooked right in front of you.   the rack of lamb is sublime. the ""taos combo"" or anything on the special board, especially seafood, is always incredible. their margaritas, cocktails, wine - all great. bacon wrapped shrimp ftw. they come on a plate with a tortilla on the bottom, rice, beans, and sauce on top, and the bacon wrapped shrimp on top of that. the salad, which comes with many entrees, is awesome. and don't forget the flan, topped with prickly pear syrup. you can't go wrong.   it's a testament to how good this place is that they don't need a sign.",1
"there is no ""premium"" in the phoenix premium outlets. those of you expecting to find the same premium outlets that you find in palm springs, orlando and las vegas are in a for a rude awakening. unless you consider banana republic high end, you can forget it. there are no gucci, prada, diesel, burberry and the likes. in fact, there is really no reason to come here at all. you can go to any other mall or shopping area in the valley and get better selection and service. in fact, just go to casa paloma down the street on ray and i-10 and there banana republic over there is much nicer. i don't really know who they are catering to with this mall but don't be surprised to see this mall die in 5-10 years much like the casa grande outlets. after all, why go here when you can shop at the same stores in the chandler mall which is indoor and offers a better selection and isn't much more expensive. the parking is limited. the design to enter and exit is cumbersome at best. there is no appeal to coming here. the owners of this mall better find some quality stores in a hurry or this thing is toast.",0
"we've been here many, many times. mostly for the same reasons everyone goes here: the gorgeous patio, the margaritas, and the warm homemade tortillas. that being said, when we were here last night and my husband ""checked in"" he was surprised to see only two stars. so we discussed and realized that what really kills this place every time is the service. which is unfortunate, because they usually have a good product.   until last night the food has been pretty good, not spectacular but again we go for the 3 reasons mentioned above. last night though, i think i'd had it. we had our trifecta but it simply wasn't enough. the service was awful and my meal was served cold and tasted like it had been sitting around for 30 min. which is probably the case because it took a rather long time to come out. i ordered the tesoro del mar which is basically a salad with jumbo shrimp. i've gotten it many times and the flavors are usually good. last night the shrimp was stone cold and hard--i had trouble cutting it with my knife.   our server was mia most of the evening, and when she did show up it was to try to get us to order more drinks after we told her we had our fill at the bar waiting for our table. we had to request the tortillas because she didn't automatically bring them out, she was delayed with our check and with taking our bill after i was clearly fed up and wanted to leave.   i think i'm done. after i work all day, going out to eat is a treat. going here again is not worth my hard-earned money or my aggravation.",0
"the complimentary, efficient valet and steak salad are the stars of this new steak house.  the service is the distraction; hostess was insistent that we provide our name for the list although we are clear that our eats will be in the bar.  (they actaully do no follow up with us although we are now on the list - huh?!?)  the bar maintained the same layout as houston's had. however the handful of bartenders never connect and they begin the intimate relationship with a request for a credit card for the tab.   lots of activity behind the bar with napkin folding, glass washing and comraderie (9 to 10 pm) and we flag them down for water, again for eats, for a bill, then to pay the bill - even with debit cards clearly lined up with bill in glass on bar.   a waitress apologizes for a delay with the steak salad and offers a complimentary dessert. we never see the generous gal again nor was the offer apparently passed onto our flock of inattentive servers.   one of the best steak salads in the 'hood with a perfectly grilled steak and lightly dressed lemon horseradish dressing. our valet responds to a text to grab the car. with a smile from the young man, we escape the rudeness of del frisco's into the arizona night.",0
we eat here constantly for lunch - fast - consistent - awesome mexican food and bomb pastry's too. those cone things... get one... you can thank me later.  they do take debit and good chips and salsa while you wait but i've never had a lunch order come out more than ~6 min wait. refills on cokes and chips and a small little dining area but it's classic chandler hole in the wall with awesome food.  you have to go here,1
"big portions, that's really all i can say about this place.  the sauce is okay, the brisket is okay but nothing is great.  rootboot floats are good, but nothing i can't make at home.  worth one shot if your curious but i'm not going back.",0
"all i can say is, i wish it were my neighborhood store.  an alta dena lactose product, a bst sandwich [bacon spinach and tomato], and beet chips crackling beside me ...",1
"i'm a big fan of this place.  i love the wholesale prices and i save a ton of money here.  i go through so many pet supplies for our pet care business (potty bags, wipes, medical supplies, toys, etc....).  i recommend it to each and every one of my dog owning clients.  the cons are the no air conditioning, and the $25 minimum purchase.  also, i have made numerous trips to find that what i wanted was out of stock.  however, they usually get it within a week.    overall, a great place with great prices.",1
"enjoyable meal!  i mean this is a niche fast food joint and reliably provides what one expects. i prefer the burrito bowl, seems healthier. give it a try.",1
"all i can say about this place is that this place is fast but i think that is because they don't put meat on their sandwiches. maybe this was just a product of coming in there at 10pm?  if you're looking for meat, go to firehouse subs. if you're looking for a lettuce on a bun, come here!",0
"you know, i'm not much of a wino, but this place isn't bad. i love the modern feel inside, with a killer open-air bar that spans the length of the building. yeah, parking is a bitch, but good thing there's complimentary free valet. the wine selection is great (it's no cowboy ciao, but way more than you'll find at most spots) and the pricing is decent. there isn't anything in the way of entrées, but who cares? the bruschetta selection is better than anywhere else in town, and a serving of those is enough to fill up my belly anytime.",1
"i stopped here after work on friday with a groupon that expired the same day.  big mistake.  i entered the restaurant at about 5:15 pm and placed my order.  nothing said or done for another hour.    i ordered the mutton stew which was bland.  it was more like a soup with mutton (lamb) and potatos - nothing more!  when i placed my order the restaurant was half full.  within the next 15 minutes it was packed with patrons and their expiring groupons.  i had an exhausting week at work so i honestly did not mind waiting for my food.  however, i had noticed that my order was misplaced.  after 45 minutes i had to ask if they had my order (everyone else got their food).  within 5 minutes i had my food and was ready to go.  i felt bad for the person taking orders.  he was clearly overwhelmed.  the fry bread was delicious and the prices are reasonable.  i will likely give it another try in the future.  good food is worth the wait; the mutton stew is not!",0
"i'm pretty sure robin williams was staying in our room right before we arrived bc our room was covered in pubic hair.  there was a dirty, pubic hair filled towel hanging up in our bathroom our sheets had pubes everywhere the walls were filthy with black stains (see pic)   the life guards are so intense. i felt like i was getting yelled at the whole time and i wasn't even doing anything. they just feel like shouting about the rules constantly. total kill-joys.  the breakfast buffet was actually surprisingly goodand the customer service was wonderful, the staff is super friendly.   special shout out to their pillows. amazing pillows.   i won't be back though.  ps...i originally gave this review 2 stars until the hilarious heather c. pointed out the below. she is so right! and i can't stop laughing.

"i am such a fan of portillos after having it at the first location in sdale and this location is just as great. the employees are all so welcoming and jolly :) i think i love everything on the menu  but if you want something sweet, get the cake shake, it is heaven in a cup i am having a salad tonight, the grilled chicken caesar... :) as much as i wanted the drenched italian beef, i ate so much this weekend that a salad is much needed   oh portillos, you shall see me all the time",1
"i like the great selection/variety of choices, and  i am down for good soup anytime of year, even when it's 110+ degrees outside.  i had the mushroom soup (based on employee's recommendation), and it was delicious!  would definitely get it again.  the sandwich on the other left much to be desired.  when i first saw it, i literally thought they made a mistake and gave me a kids' combo or something because the sandwich looked like something my mom would make in one of those sandwich press machines back in the 80's.  no kidding.  the sandwich didn't have much on it, and it didn't have much flavor.  very over-priced for what i got.  i would probably just stop in for a bowl of soup in the future or maybe try a salad next time, but i won't be duped into another one of their sandwiches, sorry.",0
"i'm never really thrilled when someone suggests maize's...even though it's attached to my building.  not even on burger night when they advertise $5.00 burgers...which, btw, is really a $10 burger because you have to order a drink to get the special.  ok.  but $2.50 for iced tea, another $1.00 for cheese, and really, you're going to charge me another $1.00 for a salad instead of fries??  the burgers just aren't that interesting or flavorful!  i'd much rather go down the road on central to a different burger night special and get something delicious.",0
"we stopped in here after a brisk walk from the light rail and were immediately greeted, even before stepping in. inside, it was busy. virtually every table was sat and the bar was full. maybe it had to do with the building itself, but there was nothing about tmi that made it seem new or recently-opened to me. the vibe felt like it could have been here for years.  although we were only out for drinks, the food looked really tempting. i remember seeing the coronado coney on the menu and rethinking having dinner #2. i skipped it, but i'll be back, don't you worry.   i had some draft nimbus and noticed that their entire draft selection was either local or westcoast, which later was explained to us as no accident. some dogfish head, stone, or some imports would be delicious additions, but it's not like you can't go anywhere else and get it.  after finally making our way to the bar, we chatted with the owners and tried a previously mentioned luscious dessert/drink made with an imperial porter and raspberry vodka. the owner was playing some oldschool outkast from his laptop behind the bar, and i sampled an ipa out of colorado (?) that i definitely want next time.   i'll be back soon.",1
"small little bakery serving up light, spongy japanese style cakes, pastries, and bread.  they also have gourmet jams and jellies such as meyer lemon marmalade.  the strawberry cake i had was excellent.  it was very light, not too sugary, with slices of fresh strawberry.  i sampled a few other desserts, and liked the green tea mousse the best.  we went here on a sunday afternoon, and there was a limited selection of dessert, but what they did have was quite tasty.  they also have drinks such as iced coffee and shakes that i'd like to try out next time i'm here.  the tiramisu shake sounds intriguing!",1
"i hope this was an isolated incident, because i really love pappadeaux's.  it's not someplace i go regularly, rather reserved for special occasions. it's a little on the pricey side but certainly in line with the usual value they offer. the food, service and ambiance have always been top-notch and i've been saying for weeks now that it's where i wanted to go for my birthday dinner.   despite the fact that they're a chain (huge in texas and elsewhere, but only 1 single location in phoenix), i feel like they operate like an indie and get it right on most fronts.  my favorite dish is the crawfish platter (a ginormous platter piled high with authentic dirty rice in the middle, flanked by breaded, fried crawfish on one side and thick, savory crawfish étouffée on the other side).  last night's birthday dinner was unfortunately an absolute bust.  i was excited to show my boyfriend the amazing wonder of pappadeaux's, as he'd never been there before and i'd been talking it up for weeks.  we were seated right away (which was atypical because they're always packed), but we did get an annoying end table right on the corner so there were constantly people pushing past us and bumping into my chair.  whatever, luck of the draw, and i was happy to be seated right away.  our server erich came over and took our drink order.  i ordered a coke and water.  i got diet coke, which tastes like poison.  waited a few minutes trying to flag him down (admittedly this guy had at least 2 other tables he was waiting on) and i pointed that out to him and he launched into some weird back and forth about how it should be coke.  you're tellin' me buddy, that's what i ordered.  he took it away and a different server brought me a regular coke with a smile.  very nice.  thank you.  then erich returned and babbled awkwardly about the mishap. it's fine. this happens a lot. most people drink diet poison - i get it.   he took our orders and said he'd be back with some bread.  the bread and butter was dropped off pretty quickly, which is when we realized we had no set-ups.  it's kinda hard to spread butter on your bread without a knife.   we waited a few more minutes looking for him to flag him down again.  he grabbed set-ups for us and said something about ""i wish we could assure that all tables could have set-ups when they're bussed but that's nearly impossible...""  ok, whatever, i just want utensils and a napkin.  thank you.  the food this time was ok.  normally it's stellar. maybe i was already annoyed by what i considered ""strike 1"" and ""strike 2"".  both crawfish entrées were great.  the dirty rice was definitely subpar --undercooked and very dried out/chewy.   erich asked us if we needed anything. i asked for an extra tartar sauce and a spoon for my étouffée.  he brought them right over.  at that point, at the beginning of the meal my coke was still full. like most people, i drank it intermittently while i chewed and ate and it was soon gone, but i still had half a plate of food to eat.  no sign of erich.  no coke in my glass. so i just continued eating and finished my plate.    at the end of the meal, erich re-appeared and asked if we needed anything.  my other half motioned at my glass but at that point my food was gone and i just wanted to leave.  erich then realized that maybe i wanted a refill and asked if i did. i said don't worry about it and asked for the check.  then we waited some more.  the check came and i swear to you the fastest thing i saw the waiter do all night was process the check and get us out of there.  what bugged me was that i could see many other tables around us being served and having a great time with their servers, lots of smiles, hospitality and ambiance. i felt like we got the shaft.  i have to say that in the past i've always had impeccable service, amazingly fresh food and a top-notch experience at pappadeaux's.  perhaps this was an off night.  perhaps erich had too many tables.  perhaps we shouldn't have even left him 10% gratuity.  three dings on service, one on food and one on the crappy table.  i'll have to think long and hard before spending my money there again.",0
"i went to ncounter because of yelp.  waaay overrated in my opinion! after you order at the counter, you have to fight for a table if you have more than two people in your group. there was relatively fast turnover, but it's annoying having to cherry-pick someones table hoping they'll leave after their last bite. but, being a saturday morning, being busy wasn't a deal breaker.  when i received my omelette, the cheese was partially melted and rather tasteless. the eggs were rubbery like something you'd get at a cheap buffet. the potatoes were ok, but didn't compensate for the rest. overall, the portion sizes were small and the food was just mediocre. i'm not a picky breakfast person, but i would rather go to denny's or ihop than come back to ncounter.  if you're looking for good breakfast in tempe (near mill), you're not far from harlow's, essence bakery, cafe boa or even u.s. egg.",0
"we attended the grand opening of sit...stay last night. mostly because my toddler's new obsession is hot dogs and how could we not indulge her on national hot dog. plus, we're big fans of short leash!  i could write a novel about our experience (a good one!), but i'll try keep it short and to the point.   positive:  - while service was on the slower side (totally understandable, it was packed!), the servers and owner were incredibly friendly, accommodating, and so gracious. they thanked us multiple times for coming out to support them and apologized beforehand for any bumps we may experience.  - the menu! it took me a few minutes to realize they have a completely new additional menu available. while we stuck to the regular dog offerings this time, we'll be back to try some of the new items.   - the food, of course. normally i go for the igby, but gave the devil dog a try instead. it was awesome!   - they split our table's check no problem. we ordered four dogs, a kids dog, and a polkadot casserole (?) and our check was $51. not bad. obviously pricier than the truck, but we don't mind paying a little extra for the sides, ambiance (a/c!), full service, and bigger selection.   - design and location. it's super cute inside. you can tell they spent a lot of work making it reflect the short leash brand.    now i totally understand it was opening night and there would be a few wrinkles needing smoothing out. here are a few of the minor bumps we experienced:   - i asked for mushrooms to be subbed in place of the red peppers on my devil dog, but didn't receive either. they were swamped and i didn't want to be ""that"" person, plus the dog was pretty killer anyway so i let it go. no biggie! next time i'll speak up if needed.  - they forgot the chips with one of our kids dogs, but the owner had them out pronto when we asked about them. again, nothing big! though they were very apologetic, and we appreciated that.    - the macaroni and cheese was....different. the penne was really large and the cheese sauce was very....gummy? processed? i'm not sure the word i'm looking for. it left a funky film on our teeth, and my daughter didn't eat more than a bite (when she normally loves homemade mac and cheese). would love to see this improved!  - the salad vinaigrette. the green salad that comes with the dogs was really underwhelming. the dressing was light but also pretty flavorless, which made my salad taste pretty ""green"". nothing wrong with that, but i think a simple green salad should have a pretty flavorful dressing paired with it.   all in all, it's been pretty awesome to witness short leash grow as it has over the last few years. the owners and staff have always been so great when working the trucks...they truly deserve this. everyone was so excited to be there, and we were excited to be a part of it! we'll definitely be back soon.",1
"north scottsdale really needs more restaurants like this. as the name says, this place is all about beers and burgers. the service is great, and the burgers are consistently delicious. i really like their decor, even though they have a gazillion tvs. definitely great atmosphere for watching a game. the outdoor patio is dog-friendly. they even have a water dish for pups!  they used to have it set up so you walked up and ordered your food then seated yourself. this system created a huge line of people, despite the numerous open tables. since they have switched to standard table service, we have gotten our orders in right away and been served our food much quicker.  the best part about cold beers and cheeseburgers is the happy hour, which runs from 3 to 7. yes, $10+ dollars is a lot for a burger and a side. but during happy hour, you can get the cb&cb burger (essentially a cheeseburger with garlic aioli sauce) with fries for $6. all drafts are $4, and by drafts i mean 19.5 ounces! it's by far the best drink special north of the 101. they offer several beers from four peaks, papago, and santan, as well as the ole' standards. dos equis is $4.50 all day!  the sweet potato tots are to die for, but you can't substitute them for the fries during happy hour. we figured out it's cheaper to order a side of sweet tots (it's large!) and split it between the three of us while still each getting the cb&cb burger with fries.  during az beer week they had beer tasting on the patio. for $10, you got 8 generous samples and a 19.5 ounce draft of your choosing. i hope they do this again next year!",1
"went here for lunch, big mistake.  the nice is decked out nice for a strip-mall but the food just was not happening.  2 stars because the service was excellent.    i got the fettucine alfredo with chicken.  the sauce was watery.  alfredo watery?  really?  the chicken was a good flavor, but the running sauce just takes away from the chicken.  and the parmesan cheese is on the table not freshly grated.  no thanks!",0

"food is okay but not worth the lengthy wait on weekends. if there were more breakfast choices around this area, tbc would be empty.   i've ordered breakfast on two occasions here and both times it came out cold, plus the order was messed up.   the outdoor patio on the side street is nice but the scottsdale road side gets quite noisy with the traffic.  wait staff and hostesses are nothing fabulous, not overly friendly considering the price and the wait.   maybe i should down a couple malibu drinks before i come for breakfast and it would be a better experience.",0
"on my first visit to az when i was still living in la... i was brought here for a hike. i remember thinking, it couldn't phase me, i'm queen of the stairmaster at the gym. lol. ohhhh was i wrong. this far surpasses any stairmaster at any gym. i couldn't make it to the top that day. this mountain especially with the crazy az summer heat kicked my ass!   after moving to az, i was determined to conquer it. on my second attempt, i was able to make it to the top. over the last two years, i've probably hiked this over 30 times, and believe me it does not get any easier each time. but once you make it to the top and see the view you'll see that it's sooo worth it.  now, my next goal is to go up and down twice. so far, i've been able to go up and down 1 1/2 times. it's a great workout.   and yes, i take all my la friends that visit up here and get a kick out of watching them dying trying to climb it. it's definitely different from what we're used to out there.",1
"my standards are pretty low while extremely hung over wearing the same clothes i participated in crazy drunken debauchery the night before. but i still left bagel nosh feeling like i wished i had gone to ihop next door.  i ordered the $7 arizona classic: an egg sandwich with bacon and cheese on the bagel of my choice. the quality was pretty much on par with a mcbagel mcsandwich but was twice the price. the bacon was more like bacon bits and the egg was thin and tasteless. there was nothing wrong with the service, but the prices were way too high for what i was eating.  my friends had ordered a bagel with spread that looked better. so i guess the rule of thumb here would be to order a bagel only. i would definitely leave other breakfast food concoctions to another restaurant.",0
"vietnamese and thai are some of my favorite cuisines in the world. they are ""healthy"" and have fresh veggies in most dishes, carry a nice amount of spice, and have enough interesting marinades and flavors to remain interesting over and over again. cambodia, being between those two countries, has to be the same, i thought to myself. well, yes, there are many familiar dishes and the use of a lot of the same ingredients. so on to sekong by night i go.   knowing where sekong by night is, my initial inclination is that this restaurant isn't going to be around too long. the space has been the scene of many restaurant deaths, the signage is terrible, the parking lot is awkward to get into, and even knowing exactly where the place is located, it's hard to see from the east on indian school. try it. forget all of those negatives, just give it a shot because if you like southern asian cuisines, you'll have a good meal here. i tried the grilled beef sandwich that was featured by new times' chow bella blog and enjoyed it very much. it was a tad bland because they do not use jalapenos like the vietnamese do in their bahn mi, but still enjoyable. served on a french baguette, with pickled carrot and daikon root shavings, marinated meat, and cilantro, it was almost identical to the bahn mi. then came the differences, beef instead of pork (apparently cambodian dishes are almost always beef, vietnamese are almost always pork, and thai are almost always chicken) and a soybean paste. mmm  service here was very nice. i spoke with both the server and the owner for some time and they were very nice people with good english skills which was a pleasant surprise. my sandwich with a 40% tip was $5 out the door. not too bad of a price for a lunch in a place that is nicely decorated, very comfortable, and close to the city.",1
"so the guys are a little older.  what dont you people understand about free drinks?  i walked into this place on friday night and was offered a shot of patron before i even got through the entry.    god bless barcelona.    this place has been reviewed so much so i'll stick to the basics:  its huge. lots of comfortable couches/tables/standing room. dance floor thats really really packed. cover band.  think zowie bowie but lame.   older crowd, but not creepy-old and not too-poor-to-buy-girls-a-drink old.   great table/bottle/vip service awesome, spacious, asthetically pleasing, modern bathrooms with an attendant.  no lines. no cover for girls, $10 for dudes.  in summary, aside from the really bad band (if you can even call them that, they just sig over popular music...music that i like, but the singers are so cheesy and weird it freaks me out), i loved barcelona.  definitely worth the 15 minute road trip north from old town.",1
"i went here for restaurant week with the bf last friday night. it was really good. we had a really good server who was friendly and efficient.  for our appetizers, the bf got the bacon fat popcorn and thought it was fantastic.... i'm not a huge fan of bacon, but it was ok in my opinion. i got the mirliton salad, which was delicious! it has such a variety of textures and flavors, it had popcorn, chayote (which i had never had), cheese, cucumber, onion and really tasty dressing. i would definitely order that again. for mains, the bf got the pork tenderloin, which was absolutely delicious! i was so mad that he ordered better than me (like usual). it was the pork with mashed sweet potato, chevre, and figs with apple jus... it was so delicious and full of flavor. i ordered the chicken which i absolutely would not order again (that's where the star came off). it was chicken with a corn risotto and an onion and mushroom hash. it was all kind of smokey.... but not in a good way, and did not have a flavor that i liked. the risotto was not sweet like i thought it would be... and all the flavors kind of blended together so you couldn't taste the components. i make a better risotto at home, so i was very disappointed. luckily for me, the bf shared some of his pork with me. so for desserts the bf got the pig in the orchard, which is a bacon bread pudding with a cinnamon -y ice cream. this was good, but my dessert beat the pants off of it (woot!!). i got the pot de creme. this was the highlight of the meal! it was amazing... it was a whiskey, coffee, and chocolate pot de creme and it was so rich and delicious.... if i could eat it everyday, i would, and i would be fat and wouldn't care..... so overall, it was good and i would definitely come back however i would definitely not order the chicken again.",1

"so it's saturday night. the girlfriend and i are watching our colleges play some top notch basketball while having a few adult beverages. after one school wins, mine u of a, we decide it's time for dinner. well what  goes better with basketball and beers than pizza? we were proven very wrong......   so we ordered crust because her sister had a great pizza a week earlier  and it was close. we decided the classic hawaiian pizza would hit the spot for us tonight. we called in and they said it would take around 20 minutes which was perfect.  we arrived just in time and bought our $25 pizza as it was coming out of the oven. we got home and opened up the anticipated box too see our classical favorite....needless to saw we were shocked.  crust's take on a hawaiian pizza is the biggest miss i have ever seen in a classic pizza. don't get me wrong i appreciate a new twist on an old classic but this was sheer laziness. first off it's a square not round pizza this in my mind was a plus due to the thickness and crispiness. however that was the only plus to the whole pizza.   for those of you that went to public elementary school do you remember pizza day? its was a square greasy piece of pizza with cubed pepperoni. well the hawaiian pizza at crust isn't far off.  the pizza came out with 8 large slices and a medium thick crust. the cheese and meat looked like deli slices you would pick up at safeway laid on top not even covering the pizza. the final touch was canned cubed pineapple on top of the deli meat and cheese.  if you are looking for a $25 pizza your toddler can make but want to call it a scottsdale fusion then i suggest you run to crust. if not then i  would suggest papa johns....they deliver....",0
"good place. i have been coming here for years. it's even better now that they expanded and purchased the coffee shop next door (which is now the pita house bar).  the food is good, the patio and new bar are are set-up well. service is reasonable and the staff are very friendly. good solid food at a fair price.  i have yet to try one of the hookahs on their outdoor patio, though i intend to imbibe one of these evenings real soon.",1
"my visit to va bene was a tale of two meals. since a salad doesn't come with your entree, i ordered a caesar salad, big mistake! the salad was awful. the salad was small and the dressing tasted almost like mayo. i had my wife take a bite to make sure i wasn't wrong in my assessment.   when the server asked how the salad was, i honestly told her the salad wasn't good. the look on her face was priceless. i sucked it up and ate my salad. i hate to see $9 go down the drain.  my meal was better. i had the rigatoni, sausage, peppers in a cream sauce.  i liked the dish quite a bit, but i was still a little scorned from the salad fiasco.   entree 4 stars salad 0  stars  the service was decent. the inside was nice and had a nice atmosphere. i can see why people like this place.  to me, this place is more flash.  i don't plan to head back to this place. if you do go, i'd avoid the salad. i think other italian places in the area give you better food at the same/cheaper rate and overall provide better value for your dollar.  just my 2 cents.",0
"just another nuevo-trendy place with average food at best.  six bucks for ""made-to-order"" potato chips which, after quizzing the waitress, we came to find out are just potato slices that they fry when you order them and not before.  even more comical were the $6 deviled eggs.  yep, you read that right - this joint has managed to make that old picnic staple into an ""in"" entre.  nothing spectacular about them at all - just 6 deviled eggs in a little wooden tray.  at least we only had to pay $5 for ten ounces of a mediocre beer (stella) to wash it down.  not that it was all bad.  it's a comfortable place with a decent decor.  but in short, if you are concerned more about buzz than quality or value, this may be the place for you.",0
"great service, good food, at the best price!  :)   i've been to this restaurant several times and can recommend the following items:  basil fried rice: flavorful and delicious, different from the generic fried rice at other restaurants  salmon: seared so that it has that crispy glazed edge.  one of my favorite items.  might ask for sauce on the side though because they give a lot.  crab angels: always delicious, crispy, and warm!  overall, the restaurant is a bit far from the phoenix area, but it is well worth the drive.  there is a lot of seating, which makes it a great place for parties!  friendly staff is always a plus as well.",1
"get. in. mah. belly!   oh where to begin the ode to in and out? how about the fact that the meat is fresh and the french fries are freshly cut? oh, i missed you in and out! and all the veggies are fresh too? and the milkshakes are just flat out delish?   be prepared for many people to share your space, as most likely they share the desire for these delicious burgers. for the same reason, there is usually a line. what is nice about all of this, is the fact that even though it is super busy, the service is still great! people are friendly, and the food is still fresh when you get it.   if you're looking for chicken or tofu, this is not the place.   and if you don't feel like going inside, consider the drive through. as you are patiently waiting, there is a massive window allowing you a front row view into the kitchen. makes me feel a bit like a stalker, but surprisingly entertaining. you will feel as though you are waiting for your last meal on earth...but then again, it may as well be.",1

"we were toally delighted with our brunch at local breeze today...honeslty, it was so wonderful i was really caught off guard.  we sat on the patio in the light rain, and enjoyed the heater and the wonderful service of more than one server and multiple visits to check on our meal and our comfort level.   i ordered the spicy chicken omelet (chicken sautéed with white wine, chilies, horseradish and tabasco smothered in cream cheese sauce) and my fiance ordered the atomic burger (pepper jack cheese with atomic horseradish) and we both had a side of spicy cottage cheese.  the cottage cheese was my favorite...but the omelet and the burger were both delish.  niether were too spicy, which was a tad dissappointing, but both were filling and done quite well.    we also enjoyed a bloody mary that was made very well by preston at the lovely outdoor bar.  i highly recommend this restaurant and have always loved the location and the space (which was a nursery at one time, i am told, and has a wonderful patio).  the best thing about this place is no wait!  why (oh why) do people stand in line at matt's big breakfast (which has a basic menu and a simple taste experience) when they can get the best 2 eggs, bacon and toast around town on a patio with an awesome restroom (yes, it's the most adorable restroom ever!) here at local breeze?  it just baffles me why folks stand in line for that experience when they can hang out with a cocktail and play bean bag toss while enjoying good music and comfortable seating - even a fire pit!   i regret being so honest and delighted by this place - i know it will come back to haunt me when i have to wait in line next weekend.",1

"(updated 10/25/07) we need a 6th star for this place.  forget about capital grill, this is the place to go if you call yourself a foodie or want to be one.    the tasting menu at binkley's is the way to go.  it starts off at $60 for 4 courses, $65-72 for 5 courses and $77 for 6 courses.  a steal, i tell you, compared to french laundry's (where kevin binkley used to work) $200+ tasting menu and it's almost just as good plus you get to pick your dishes and you don't have to deal with 2 month advance reservations.  the drive to cave creek is so worth it!  even more amazing is that they give you a ton of really creative amuse bouche (little morsels to amuse your mouth) before your first course even hits the table and then more throughout the meal.  we got at least ten tonight.  what a deal!  just to give you an idea of the amuse bouche craziness, this is some of what we got in the last two meals (check out the pixs above if you wanna see what tasty looks like): - parsnip soup - baby zucchini with organic tomato-caper relish - tomato water with sriracha jelly & celery salt (on strobe light) - romeseco with parmesan foam & eggplant chips - house pulled mozzarella with golden raisins & almond - sausage with artichoke chip - green apple sorbet & grapefruit sorbet - puffed wild rice crispy treat  wine pairing is available and highly recommended.  dan the sommelier is super cool and used to be a humanitarian photographer traveling all over 3rd world countries.  the staff here have really interesting backgrounds and manage to strike the balance between being professional and friendly.  make sure to ask for the tasty potato chips (usually just served at the bar). if you can imagine those colorful terra chips reaching ""be all that they can be"" level of goodness, then you'd know what i mean.    menu changes daily to keep with seasonality and what's fresh.  hope they keep the divine burgundy truffle pumpkin agnolotti for a little longer so that i can have it at least one more time.",1
"the name just about says it. the place should be kept a secret to avoid a big mistake by going there and wasting your money.  a groupon came available and my wife and i jumped on it since we enjoy mexican and we see this place every time we head to the store further down chandler.   since we had a groupon, we had to make a reservation. we arrived and still had to wait about 10 minutes to get seat. not a good start. we were greeted, informed the server we had the groupon and told we can't use the groupon for the taco special. we didn't plan on it since we rather have entrees, but noted.  we ordered the chips and guacamole and were pleased with the dish. very good!  i ordered the combination plate, 2 enchiladas, rice beans and a taco.  my wife had the fish taco plate. when my food arrived, my enchiladas were dry, bland and the worst enchiladas i've had in my lifetime.they were awful and couldn't envision anybody liking them. enchiladas should be flowing with sauce and meat and cheese. these enchiladas were anything buy. the beans tasted they came out of a can. hard and not flavorful rice was okay. the taco was the best thing on the plate and that was really average at best.    i wasn't looking for much, just good mexican food! you won't find that here!  my wife's order came with just the tacos. no rice no beans. took many minutes to correct the problem.  i was able to get a refill early, but my wife never got her water refilled. she was never asked checked after the food arrived. we tried to flag down our server with no luck.   the check took a long time to get to us. overall, the service was poor. the server may have been new, but even the basic servers tasks weren't done well.  a general observation was the owner/manager was going around and talking with others that he seemed to know. take a second and stop by a new person/table and get real feedback. i would have had a few helpful suggestions.  with all the issues around this place, food and service, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  there are many places in the area that serve better food!",0
"i never have a bad time at casey moore's, i dig the casual laid-back vibe and i love drinking my cider.   my only complaint: i really wish they would put some music on the patio though. perhaps this is because they don't want to disturb the neighbors, but it doesn't have to be loud....it can be a guy playing the harpsichord in the corner...i don't care. anything. something atmospheric would be nice. maybe some electronica. cos on a down night it can get really quiet out there.  other than my phobia of taking a drunken tumble down the front steps in front of everybody i love this bar.",1
"the only reason i'm not giving it a one star is because of our wonderful server cheryl. she totally rocked. attentive, humorous, friendly, and constantly refilling our h20, she did her job well. but for the others....  first off, when i made my reservation for a party of 15, they took a reservation for 6. i corrected them ""fifteeeen, as in ten plus five"". they still got a table for only 6.  the greeter was unfriendly, she told another employee that ""the party of 6 is now 15"" with a rotten attitude, and t he other employee's face turned into ""wtf you kidding me?!"" face.  so they put some tables together for us. sat down and ordered. manager came around checking on us.  i got baked rigatoni, tasted like nuked plastic (plasticy cheese that solidified the pasta)  garlic bread and breaded fried calamari w/ cheese was pretty good though.",0
"a good place to take a break from the hustle and bustle of tempe marketplace.  i've tried a few of their teas (always iced).  i find them all incredibly refreshing, especially during the hot summer days.  they brew each cup when you order and even when iced, there is plenty of tea flavor.  i actually never thought i would enjoy tea this much.  the seating, although limited, is comfortable enough to stay and chat with friends.  i always try to make a stop at tea infusion when at the marketplace.",1
"as i mentioned in my previous review, maizie's was my favorite spot with the first urban wine walk.  so it makes perfect sense that if the uww returns, so do i.  well, return to maizie's that is!  we started there this time and enjoyed all three wines they were tasting.  their pizza and bruschetta bites were great.  and after we quickly inhaled the samples, we decided to get more food.    the menu is pretty huge and everything sounded and looked delicious.  yes, we were eyeing everybody else's plate as well; the bar seats are good for that!  after ooh-ing and ah-ing over what we saw, we decided to split the spinach and artichoke dip that came with chips and pit bread.  it was great!  the best part about maizie's is that they just seem to do things right.  friendly, casual service so you feel like you're among friends.  all sorts of specials listed up on the boards so 1) you don't have to feel dumb asking and 2) you don't have to feel even dumber when you forget and have to ask again.  beer of the month (always fun to try), 20% off beer or wine to-go (what is this, vegas?), happy hour specials (you had me at ""daily""), the list goes on and on.  good food, great energy, small, cozy inside and an nice patio space too.  i have only been twice now, but have have fabulous experiences each time.  a few more times, and they win the fifth star, easy!!",1
"discovered this place with a yelp search; highest rated spa in the whole scottsdale-slash-paradise-valley area..... and that says something!  the facilities, themselves, are amzingly gorgeous... but what sets this place apart is the amenities!  couples suites, for massages, where you can take a post-shower outside and look at camelback mountain... relaxation rooms with beds, curtains, candles, tea and more... saunas... hot tubs... even a little bazaar with a library of sorts!  insanely amazing!  better still... monday through thursday all day long is a massage happy hour special right now... 85 bucks for an hour massage!!!  add 20 percent gratuity and tax and the 112 dollar bill still kills every other price in town (trust me... i called around, like a mad-man, for a couple hours).  my only complaint... which is what keeps this from a 5-star rating... was that they now close at 7 sunday through wednesday...... despite their website saying their open until 8 (a problem i let them know about and they assured me it would be fixed by morning)... and even my massage therapist letting me know that i have until 8 to hang out and enjoy the spa....... imagine my surprise when, at 7:10, the security staff wanted me out of the locker room since they'd already been closed for 10 minutes under their new hours..... grr...... relaxation-mode is kinda killed when you now have to take a power-shower and hurry getting dressed with staff members hanging around turning off lights and locking doors around you......  once they get that sorted out... i'll definitely be back to update my review... presumably to 5 stars if everything else stays as phenomenal as it was last night!  cheers!",1
"first, i came here with a coupon from one of those entertainment books my daughter's school sells.  many items were excluded including the lunch specials and the menudo.  apparently, to be truly mexican you have to enjoy eating a cow's stomach in soup -- menudo.  so eli m. and i vowed to return one day.  ah, yes, i am not even a little mexican, but suffer from a proclivity to try unusual foods others turn up their noses at.  enter groupon.  having purchased a groupon that excluded the lunch specials, but not the menudo, eli m. and i, with some friends in tow, made our return.  i told eli m. that menudo costing less than $7 seemed a little dubious given the extensive perpetuation process he described, but we didn't let a little thing like that deter us. as the menudo was cheaply priced, i also ordered a chorizo burrito a la carte.  i was trying to max out the groupon, and soup, regardless of the contents, didn't seem that filling.  eli m. doesn't eat much and was satisfied with just a medium sized bowl of menudo. in terms of taste however, he said that it was okay.  he said it was too greasy, which is what our friends also said of their food.  moreover, they have pepsi instead of coke.  and the location is a bit out off the quick lunch radius.  so, it looks like eli m. and i will max out at two visits to susie's.  thanks for the menudo.",0
little hole-in-the-wall pizza and sandwich place that reminds me of the way scottsdale used to be before it went completely upscale. the pizza and meatball subs are delicious and reasonably priced and the staff is friendly. definitely a great place to go and they even deliver if you live in the area.  highly recommended!,1
"another run-of-the mill americanized thai restaurant that seems to be the norm around az.  rubbery meats, american broccoli, boring carrots and zucchini. no spice factor, few herbs and fish sauces, no authentic dishes, or dishes done authentically. where's the roasted duck red curry, larb salads, asian/thai vegetables, whole-fried fish, papaya salad with blue crab? oh, i forgot i'm in central phoenix. geeze, i'm such a food snob. if ya'll think this is good, your mouth will melt when you get the real stuff.  on the plus side, it's a nice, small restaurant and was very busy at lunch. to-go orders don't get the house salad they serve but you do get a little eggroll wrapped in foil.  my search for  true phoenician thai food with bold, complex flavors continues.  any leads would be greatly appreciated.",0
great movies shown here.  i saw nbt here.  i'm awaiting the showing of the new hunter s. thompson film here.    good theater room too.  never really crowded.  just a pleasant movie experience overall.,1
"it's a little on the pricey side but you can be assured that your meal is free of gluten and that's worth a lot in my book!  the owner of this establishment works well with the gf community to ensure his staff is trained in cross contamination.  the other thing that's great about picazzo's is that almost everything on the menu can be made gluten free.  i always get the diavolo pizza gluten free, gf of course!  the pizza is covered with caramelized onions, red and yellow peppers.it also includes the most amazing andouille sausage and pepperoni.  i have never had a bad one!  their appetizers are good as well.  i can get great salads, cheese bread and hummus with pita that i can actually eat!  life is good!  they even have a selection of gf desserts.  what's not to love?  this location always has pretty good service and consistently good food.  it's so nice to go out and not have to worry or explain your dietary restrictions!",1
"first, no atmosphere.  after working at the clarendon for as long as i did, i recommended fattoush quite a few times and never heard a bad word about it. but, honestly, i rarely stray further west than 15th avenue as general practice. lucky for me, i was broke and at the will of my paying lunch partner, and he took me here (it's ben from the clar, fyi... here's proof that he's as into non-chain and local joints as most of us yelpers... and we drove there in his p-i-m-pin prius... owoooo).  we had virtually the same thing and were both very pleased with it. the humus is very, very good. incredibly smooth and flavorful.  lentil soup also gets incredible thumbs up.",1
"lackluster, flavorless breakfast. do not go out of your way to come here. i was shocked at how many people were waiting to eat here. i ordered the poached eggs with toast and potatoes. they overcooked the eggs; a place with the word egg in the title should be able to properly poach an egg. the potatoes were very basic and sad. the bacon my dad ordered was fatty and kinda undercooked. the big killer is that the prices were more expensive than a diner yet the quality of the food was the same.",0
"we stopped here during one of our many old town scottsdale bar crawls. imagine at least 50 people dressed in santa (reindeer, snowmen, mr. and mrs. claus) suits invading this place.   many of our friends rode the mechanical bull to loud cheers from the crowd. one of my friends was lucky enoguh to meet and flirt with the manager. she was treated to a huge yellow cotton candy feast and a dish of blueberries. i should be so lucky.  saddle ranch has a large interior with an outdoor patio (for the smokers, but not for the people who want fresh air because of the stinkin' smokers).  we'll be back, so stay tuned for the next bar crawl and our crazy antics. you should be so lucky.",1
"brought two of my nieces in here for breakfast this morning (they got to stay the night with us after our mother's day bash - and wanted to ride somewhere with the top down).  we had high hopes, based on previous recommendations!  the food portions are big here (particularly the ridiculously over-huge pancakes)... but the taste is just okay.  even the giant sausage patty and thick strips of bacon were all pretty bland.  we didn't really get ""service,"" per se...... we just got some guy who asked us what we wanted, brought it to us, and we never saw him again.  maybe yesterday's mother's day breakfast business just sucked the life out if him?  i dunno... but the most we heard him talk was, ""thanks for comin' in"" yelled at us as we walked out the door...  prices are also pretty high.  i know you're serving big portions, but i don't think i'll be in again, anytime soon, with kids.  i have 13 nieces and nephews...... and today, i luckily just had two of them...... because 3 people eating breakfast in a dive diner (don't argue - the only decoration is license plates) shouldn't run over 30 bucks, especially with 1 eating off the kids' menu...  i get the idea...... little diner... big food......... but you still need to season that food... and then serve it with a smile...",0
such a jewel here in phoenix.    the heard museum has one of  the best native american presentations.     it is well thought out and exhibits continue to change to wet your appetite for another visit.    it is a must visit whenever you are in phoenix.   i highly recommend that you visit the heard museum.,1
"while most restaurants are closed christmas day, rustler's roost keeps on roostin' with an attractive fixed menu featuring several notable dishes. be sure to call ahead for reservations and make sure to confirm the morning of (they mixed up our time with our party size).  we arrived about 20 minutes before our 7pm reservation and hung out on the upper level near the bar. from there, you can look down at the stage, dance floor and tons of families eating with kids having fun taking turns going down the slide adjacent to the stairs. even some young-at-heart adults were using it. once seated, we admired our fairly scenic view from atop the arizona grand.  the menu that night displayed several sizes of prime rib, a new york steak, several seafood options and a turkey dinner. three of us opted for the new york steak and my future mother-in-law had the turkey. i enjoyed the flavor of the medium rare cut, albeit chewier than i like. a dab of a1 sauce was a nice complement, or even the sauce from the cowboy beans given to us to share. the turkey plate was the most attractive of all incorporating your usual thanksgiving fare.  though i'm used to a christmas dinner hosted at home, rustler's roost was a highly suitable alternative that could become a family tradition.",1
"my friend and i stopped by this restaurant last month after eating at the restaurant next door several times and wondering about this place. we've know been there twice and it is my new favorite thai restaurant.  the place is cozy and have unique salt and pepper shakers on each table which is a nice touch. the service has always been prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable.   our first time at the restaurant, we both had pad thai with fried tofu from the lunch menu. it came with salad with the most incredible peanut dressing. i literally could have just eaten the salad and been happy! yum!! the meal also comes with a spring roll... all for $6.95! the pad thai was very good and it was some of the best tofu i've had, but the portions were so generous that i only managed to eat half of my food. not complaining! this is great.   the second visit, i selected the mango basil with chicken lunch special. i also ordered the house specialty drink, thai tea. both were fabulous!! i never would have guessed that mango and basil went together, but it was amazing. i forget what my friend selected the second time around, but she also enjoyed her meal.  i've never been to thai patio for dinner, but you simply can't beat their lunch menu and pricing.   if you like thai food and live in the east valley, try this place out. i can't wait to go again! just writing this review is making me crave it.",1
"we got to experience macayo's because the local italian restaurant is closed on sundays.  how to express the feel...?  not very busy on a sunday afternoon around 4 pm...overpriced and certainly light-on-the-tequila margaritas...plenty of chips and salsa being delivered to the table...entrees that took way too long to be delivered...portion size and presentation leaving much to be desired...and the waiter kept our water glasses full.  would you be satisfied with an order of rolled tacos which list on the menu as coming topped with  guacamole?  when the cheese is sprinkled on so lightly that you can count the shred strands on each one?  when the guacamole is served in a 2-ounce solo cup on the side?  i think not!  another in my party ordered a chicken soft taco and a bean and cheese burrito...the chicken was in shreds, like someone in the kitchen boiled breast, thighs and legs and subsequently shredded them with a fork.  the worst part was no seasoning...save for the salsa served with the chips.  the bean and cheese burrito was a study in rice...so much rice that it was difficult to find the beans and cheese in the burrito.  the fourth in our group ordered the nachos supreme.  the chips are advertised as coming smothered in beef or chicken (he chose beef), cheese, refried beans, tomatoes, sour cream and guacamole.  again, the guacamole came on the side in a 2-ounce solo cup as well as the sour cream.  they were not requested on the side...but they came that way.   as i am in search of the best guacamole burrito on the planet, that is what i ordered...a burrito that is guacamole, sour cream, bacon, cheese and raw onion.  the burrito i received...got the guacamole...got the cheese...got the sour cream...missing the onion...and some really fatty bacon.  it has been a long time since i had a guacamole burrito that chewy.  margaritas were just a flat-out mistake.  i guess you have to know someone behind the bar to get much more than the faint whisper of a tequila bottle being passed in front of the glasses.  when they are delivered, they look incredible...the glasses filled perfectly...the salt on the rim done so well you could take a measuring tape to the glass and find perfect consistency all the way around.  while i enjoy the look of a well-presented margarita, i wanna feel and taste tequila in it!  maybe this works for the family 'hispanic eatery down the street'...it does not do so well for me.",0
"first admission: we ate a lot of sushi, sitting comfortably at the modest sushi bar with attentive, over competent chefs.  then a waiter with hair to his shoulders (not tied back) ducks behind the sushi bar to get a dish. the 2nd & 3rd times, the waiter, with the unkempt hair - behind the sushi area, essentially ended our meal. tucking his hair behind his ears then grabbing for a plate. gross and unacceptable.",0
"i sound like a snob, but after being in thailand twice and experiencing the glory of thai massage, at about 5 bucks for an hour, i couldn't bear to pay more than that with the possibility of being disappointed. alas, in our great country, no massage is cheap.   for a birthday treat to the wife, i booked us a thai royal hot stone foot massage. o...m...g.... it was glorious. 90 bucks for the both of us, for an hour. i never hear of this place, so i was surprised that they were so busy with clients. we were greeted upon entering by a superbly friendly lady and given the basic run-down of what to expect. i thought ""come on...we've had the real deal. you can't possibly expect us not to know what to expect"". but this is a thai foot massage with flair.   we didn't have to change, but had i known how extensive even their foot massages were going to be, i would have worn far less cumbersome clothing.   in the massage area, we were shown to reclining lounges an dangled our legs off the end. it starts with a warm water foot bath, followed by a coma inducing rub down of the feet and calves. i started snoring. was woken up by the startling feel of very hot stones being rubbed on my feet and calves. although they were hot, it felt so great!  they add in a 5 minute face and scalp massage (my eyes roll to the back of my head for these), followed by a nearly full on body massage and stretch. and this is just the hour long foot massage. the 90 minute or even full thai massage must be wicked comprehensive!  i arose drooling around the mouth, disoriented, with a s**t eating grin on my face. the wife was equally gelatinous. if sheriff joe was around, we might have gotten arrested for ""relaxing too much in public"".   i can't wait for the next one!",1
"we have eaten here a few more times and each time we have been, we have liked this place more. we mostly go for dinner. the masala in the dosa is very bland and not enough. the sambhar could be a tad more spicy. but, overall we like this place. he loved the gobi manchurian that they serve there and the naans were awesome. better than any north indian restaurant naans that we have eaten and mind you this is a south indian restaurant. my vegetarian and vegan friends love this place.",1
"the toppings, set up, etc are creative, but definitely not the best tasting burgers i've ever had.  their fresh donuts with salty caramel sauce was ok, but some were crunchy.  sweet potato fries were decent but more on the limp side.  all in all, won't go kicking and screaming if it came to it but wouldn't suggest the place.",0
this local coffee shop is just a few blocks from where i live. i'm not that hard to please. i simply want good service and fabulous coffee. i get both at this place. love the free wifi. sometimes i go here just to get away and catch up with online stuff/emails. give it try. ~x~,1
"i just don't get the fascination with this place. they don't do a bad burger but they also don't do anything special either and still charge too much for it. i don't think their quality is that much higher over say jack in the box or in n out yet it's $10+ for a basic burger and some fries.  sorry but if you are going to charge premium prices don't make a sub-par burger, if i am paying $7 for a basic cheeseburger don't tell me the only way you will make it is well done.   the fires are good but they aren't anything to write home about either, i do suggest them with the cajun seasoning though as it does add a little something.  the one plus they have going is free peanuts in the shell, not exactly sure how that ties into a burger joint but i still like them.",0
"well i wouldn't really call this place a ""cocktail lounge"" like sayyyy side bar but to me it was more like a very well lit pool hall. even though there was no smoking inside it was hekka smokey in this place. i am guessing this place is 21+ thats why people like it oh and cheap drinks!?!?! i'm not sure but this place kind of reminds me of river city pockets with less pool tables?? if this was like the only option available i'd go if you made me, cuz you cant fool me twice. i'd rather just sit home and drink myself to sleep.",0
"it's been about two years since we went to mbfg in old town. after we were seated and already ordered the saganaki, i realized why we hadn't been in such a long time . . . the place is a d-u-m-p!  the only atmosphere that reminds me that we're in a greek restaurant is the startling cry of ""opa!"" when the flaming whatevers are brought out from the kitchen.    once i got past that, i was able to concentrate on the actual food and drink.  apparently, they are changing the menu and they were out of quite a few of the better known, middle-of-the-road type wines and had only greek varieties available. greek wine? would it taste like ouzo? the water, by the way, does not taste filtered, even with a lemon wedge, it tasted industrial strength.  saganaki, according to my friend and my husband, was divine. the combination platter was huge, enough for three people with dolmades, spanikopita, koftes, tzaziki, and hummus.  mbfg is one of the few restaurants in the area that put lamb in the dolmades.  very delicious! the spanikopita was light, fluffy and perfectly seasoned. the koftes was also very flavorful. i am not a fan of their hummus (too sour), nor their tzaziki (too runny).  their pita was on the hard side and a little too greasy for my taste. hubby had the pastitsia which he enjoyed . . . a nice hint of nutmeg sealed the deal. my girlfriend had the greek salad . . . a big disappointment.  it had all the right veggies, but the dressing tasted like caesar . . . a major faux pas for my girlfriend who is the greek food diva!  i have been to the paradise valley location and the atmosphere is much more spirited and well, it just looks brighter.  the old town location is like eating in a cave.  if you can get past that, you can have an enjoyable meal.  i can't speak to the service since it was a very quiet sunday night and our server was quite attentive . . .",0
"well after seeing ""paul's"" glowing review of a place that hadn't even opened yet, i really feel like panning the place.   i guess i'll refrain and give you my straight up review.  but first a note to ""paul"" your a ass clown douchebag. and noting that ""paul"" has never reviewed any other place clearly ""paul"" is aligned with the owners which is incredibly sad and lame!!!!  here goes:  the interior is absolutely beautiful and a welcome change from it's past occupant (the willow house). my latte was quite tasty but unfortunately also very weak. i was there on the first day of their ""soft opening"" and they had yet to install a wi-fi access point (kinda a major thing for a coffee shop in my opinion). i was told that they will supply free wif-fi with a purchase, but that had yet to be setup.  the art on the walls was from local artists which i totally appreciate. the seating was varied in style and they had a comfy couch. i'd give this place another star if it weren't for the obvious attempt at gaming the yelp system.",0
"i went to eddie's house last night with the bf and two friends for restaurant week and it was a terrible experience. first of all, i had made a reservation for 7:30 more that a week in advanced and we waited until 7:50 to be seated. this was a bad omen, because, as it turns out, the whole night was made up of waiting. our waiter (who did not share his name, unfortunately because i would tell anyone to avoid him at all costs) was terrible. terrible. he came by 4 times before taking our order when we were ready after 5 minutes. each time was a weird excuse. first time he came by i asked for a restaurant week menu, he said 'a restroom menu?' why would i say that, then i ordered a glass of moscato and he's like the xxxx (whatever brand it was) and i looked down and it was the only moscato.... i was like ya... wtf? so i screamed what i wanted and he's like oh.... sorry.... i can't hear. then he said 'oh hey, i'll be back to explain things.' explain what? we're clearly ready! 'oh hey, are you ready to order? well let me go take the order of that big table back there and i'll be back to take yours' (real quote) what? seriously? we waited over 40 minutes to order. what's worse, is that we looked over like where the ef is this guy, and he was chatting at the bar!!! what, were we not wearing the right clothes? were we not hip enough to be served? or was it that we were ordering off the restaurant week menu, are we not ordering enough to get service? come on.   so he finally took our order, and we each ordered all three courses at once, because who knew when he would decide to come back. we got drinks, everyone got beer, except me who ordered the moscato. this was good, but was served in basically a thimble, it was the smallest glass of wine i have ever seen. then we waited... and waited... and waited. we ate the whole basket of bread (which was great, but overshadowed by our terrible service). we got our appetizers, we had at least one of each available (a peach soup, a salmon flat bread, and a fetoush salad). the soup was really weird, not bad, just different. the salad was overpoweringly oniony, but still tasted good, although it was supposed to have toasted pita and had one tiny piece... and supposedly the flat bread was good, but i don't like salmon, so i didn't try it. then the waiter came by and said 'oh we're really busy tonight, that's why it's taking a long time for the food) notice there was no apology or accommodation of any kind. he also asked if we wanted bread with dinner, we said yes, but no bread ever came... weird.   we waited and waited and finally out food came. i ordered the chili chicken, the two boys ordered the meatloaf, and my other friend ordered the shrimp. i thought the chicken had a good flavor, but was really dry. the meatloaf was fantastic! it was really quite delicious, with onion strings, mushroom jus, and mashed potatoes... yum. supposedly the shrimp were really spicy, but again, i didn't try it. we ate everything, so again, the food was good, the service was awful.   so then the waiter comes by (about 10-15 min after we had finished) and says, oh do you still want dessert? um.... yes, we ordered it and it comes with our meal.... he says 'oh, cuz i think we just ran out of the pot de creme, but i'll look' well two people had ordered the pot de creme two hours ago!!!! why weren't they left aside? 'oh we had 200 more people show up tonight that expected' well, we had a reservation, so it is not our fault that you cannot staff your restaurant appropriately or turn away customers when you are too busy to handle new diners. it does not make sense. what kind of greedy restaurant is this that they can't refuse a table when people who told them they came to eat there can't even get anything off the dessert menu. it turned out they had one left, then the other person who ordered it said, oh ok, i'll have the peach crisp then....'oh, well we're out of that too cuz like it's made fresh from peaches and we didn't buy enough for all of the extra people....'   maybe if we had been served in a timely manner instead of over two and a half hours, they wouldn't have run out. oh, and maybe if the jerk who was our server had put aside the desserts for us when we ordered it over two hours before the time when we actually got dessert, that would have been nice too. the desserts were good, the pot de creme was the best, the rest of us got a 'tiramisu' which tasted like cookie dough ice cream.... not exactly what i want in a tiramisu, but fine, i guess.   finally, we get the check (around 200$, so clearly we didn't spend enough money to warrant any service) and we right out how we want the bill split between the two couples, the waiter comes by, and the bf starts saying, oh we wrote down the amounts we want on each card. the snarky jerk waiter says 'oh, you mean follow the directions, ok.' so much attitude! so rude. i wish we left no tip, cuz that's what was deserved. never again.",0
"first - the service was prompt and polite. kudos to the wait staff.  the brunch menu looks amazing. the reality was not.  the promise: corned buffalo hash w/ poached eggs, 4 slices of thick cut bacon, and a biscuit with gravy.  the reality: the corned buffalo hash wasn't a hash at all. a hash would indicate the meat and potatoes are in some way mixed.  about 4oz of the corned ""meat"" - i say ""meat"" because it was so generic it could have been nearly anything - was apparently pulled from the stew pot (still quite soupy) and laid atop 5 halves of fingerling potatoes (yes 5, i'm not sure why the odd number).  even more sad, half of the meat was a lump of fat. not just some connective tissue, an impenetrable squishy blob of fat.   the poached eggs were ok.  the bacon was awesome tasting, although too tough to cut with a fork and requiring some serious chewing to really enjoy.  the biscuit and gravy was fairly good. not traditional as it has a very sweet taste. the biscuit required a knife and fork to get trough the crust, but still not bad tasting.  the aftermath: at a cost of $32 for one plate of less than inspring food - i'll only be back if someone else is dragging me and paying.",0
"i don't know what the other reviewers are talking about, but for a ""fast food"" burger i think five guys rocks!  i went here with my husband, who has been raving out five guys ever since he had it a month ago.  he has been begging me to go, but i don't eat fast food very often, so it wasn't on my priory list.  well, we went here before a suns game last week and i must say, it blew me away.  the burger is, by far, the best fast food burger i've had.  it was made to order and i had all the toppings i love.  i got the ""little"" cheese burger with hot sauce (oh so good) and grilled onions and mushrooms.  we shared regular fries and they too were sooo... good!    so, for what it is, five guys is great!  i know my husband and i will be back when we get a craving for a good, cheap, fatty meal.",1
"we went here last night for my friend`s birthday. first time here for me. i have to say, had a great experience! we had a party of 20 and they were very accommodating with a large group. we were outside, and with the heaters, i didn`t mind, actually was a great evening outside! i had the veggie pizza, was delicious! very generous portions and i ended taking some home. wine list was mostly italian wines and good selections. i`m pretty sure i will be back here!",1
"ok so i had really high hopes for this place and felt pretty let down. i've heard tons of great things about the food, i just didnt have the same warm fuzzy feelings about it. it was nice to have good music but i felt it was too loud. i could hardly hear. i did like the art on the wall but unfortunately it wasnt enough to save itself. i am not a fan of cafeteria style set up. and the service was only ok. it just fell short of my expectations.",0
"pete's fish and chips has a reputation for being legendary in the phoenix valley, so of course i had to try it. and, wow, what a miss.  first of all, they had outdoor seating only, which isn't so bad i guess. oh wait, no, we're in phoenix, doesn't it get to be about 117 degrees f outside in the summer? sounds like a blast.  secondly, they have no tartar sauce or malt vinegar. how on earth do you even run a fish place with no tartar sauce? malt vinegar is a little more uncommon but for pete's (lol) sake even mcdonald's has tartar sauce.  third, the fish itself. speaking of mcdonalds, that is what i am reminded of, this is not batter dipped and fried fillets of fish, this is minced and formed, and covered in a crunchy, crumbly breading, like what you'd find on a mcdonald's fish sandwich.  fourth, they only take cash. what year is it?  the red sauce they give you is ok, but it is more like a shrimp sauce, i'm sure it would be great on that. it definitely does not belong on fish.  their hamburgers though, are quite good and very inexpensive. if you go to petes, get one of those. skip the fish, it's awful. i have no idea how this place became so popular on such awful fish and chips. an englishman would burn this place to the ground.",0
"went to house during restaurant week and in celebration of our 22nd wedding anniversary. the whole visit started out weird when we walked in and weren't greeted. there is no one in the front room, you then have to walk through a ""bar"" room with a ton of empty tables. bartender was busy chatting it up with waitress to say hi. we found the host station only to be ignored by a host who obviously cannot multitask. after standing around awkwardly for about 5 minutes, we were ""greeted"" (stared at until we said something). we requested to sit outside, but given that it was our anniversary, we would appreciate a table not right next to the family with the baby.  we were told ""i'll try, but it won't bite.""  swell.  we were placed at a lovely table (away from the baby as one could get, but it's a small patio...and the parents seem oblivious to the wails) that had misters pointing right at us from the ground. surprised the plants weren't frostbit, as we had to continuously move our legs they were so cold.   our waitress informed us that for restaurant week, the whole table either had to do it, or not, which we found odd since none of the rw offerings, were unique...they were just off the menu. as my husband wanted the mussels app, we decided to go with the regular menu, even though i ate 2 of the three courses from the rw menu and paid extravagantly more than the rw menu.  we ordered two glasses of prosecco (no offer of on the house due to our celebration, but that's okay..even though every other restaurant we've ever eaten at for our anniversary has offered that up) and commenced on our apps. i had the pork belly with dried figs and pistachios. some bites were great, some were lackluster. it didn't have the fatty quality that i adore in pork belly...in fact, some parts were downright dry. and the serving size was huge...it could have been a main course for many.  hubby has osso bucco which he enjoyed. i had a butternut squash ravioli with pesto which was decent, but nothing out of the ordinary at all. we ordered polenta fries with aioli, and when we reminded our waitress, it was obvious she or the kitchen forgot...we waited another 10 plus minutes for the kitchen to make them.  they were outstanding.  desserts were okay....some great ice cream from a local place, and some fig ricotta beignets with three dipping sauces.  the beignets were a bit dry, but the toppings were great.  had to wait forever for our check, and then to get it taken care of. there were many delays between courses and refills of water glass, and waitress smelled of obvious cigarette smoke on her returns. guess we were second-place to her ciggie breaks.   on the way out, there were no thank yous...just another stare from the one thing at a time host....guess he was busy holding the door open for us so he couldn't say anything....",0
"they should rename this place to lame tuesday or douche tuesday.  they serve foo foo slushy drinks that are mediocre at best. the place blasts the most annoying music so loud, that the coffee plantation shakes at night.  i usually get ""want to fight eyes"" from the steroid club that's hanging out on the patio every time i walk by.  i want to reopen this place as ""the home depot"", cause it has the most tools you have seen under one roof.  to add insult to injury they charge a cover on  weekends, like paying 8 bucks for a 24 ounce cup of ice and shit isn't bad enough.    the only redeeming deal they have is $1 for a shot of 151 rum in your cup... of course it isn't bacardi 151, but some grain alcohol off brand.    if you are here spend like $10 on those extra shots, because it will help keep you from slashing your wrists in the bathroom.  another upside to this place is that after a night here, if you vomit on a a really big piece of a paper and leave it out all night, you might be able to slang it at an art gallery as modern art.  ""this place is good... for me to poop on.""",0
"somewhere between and two and a three.  the food is not good.  there is a happy hour and a reverse happy hour.  the price points are good.  $6.00 dollar drinks, $5.00 apps.  problem is, nothing tastes very good.  the presentation is beautiful.  the restaurant is beautiful.  there is even a live band that is pretty good (except everything sounds like dave matthews), its just that the food is made to be non-offensive.  the salad with green goddess dressing, tastes like iceberg with mayonnaise.  the fried calamari is crispy but needs some realy dipping sauce other than the same green goddess type dressing.  the char siu bao is just gross.  the burger is decent and comes with some sweet potato fries.  had some duck cubes that were just cubes of protein that looked like they were dipped in hoisin sauce.  the desserts and tiki drinks fared better.  stick with maitais or hot buttered rum.  all of the drinks are sweet concoctions, but they claim to have invented the mai tai, and the hot buttered rum comes in a fun tiki glass. the desserts however were great.  pineapple upside down cake, snowall (vailla icecream, coconut shavings and chocolate sauce) and bread pudding were all top notch.  took us $60.00 bucks to get out of there for two for happy hour so it still adds up.  hit or miss, better off going to hulas.",0
"great place to go if you want to stand around like sardines in a can, getting your drink spilled all over you.   i would suggest venturing in if only to watch all the drunk chicks pass out in that hanging swing though.",0
"updating my review because i'm totally pissed off! your hamburgers aren't good enough for me to constantly be super pissed off with you guys.  i have come in several times with large parties, small parties, referred people here and i take it all back.   i came in with a friend and we weren't given the table because they were holding it 'just in case' a larger party came in. what? we're your customers and guess what. we are here. now.   are you sure a larger party will come in?  no. are we not worthy of a seat because there aren't 5 us? well, according to stax that's the case.   well f that.   i will gladly go somewhere else and be sure to tell everyone how awful you are. besides, your 'just in case' guests are far more important than the ones currently there ready to pay.   so long stax",0
best happy hour on this side of town. the bartenders are very friendly and service is always prompt. i've never had a bad drink or a bad meal here. i only go in if jennifer is working though! the bar has plenty of tvs too.,1
"it's so hard for a store to balance discount pricing with a designer image.  from the crowds of people who shop there, ""msc"" must be doing something right.  however, it just never seems to work for me, as hard as i've tried.    msc has a huge inventory, with most of it true designer names, and a fair amount those uber exclusive names like chanel, etc.  there have probably been a few hundred designer bags to choose from when i've been in.  the shoe selection hasn't been quite as big.  the store decor makes you feel welcome and happy, and the staff has always been friendly and helpful.  whenever i first walk in, i'm always impressed, and get really excited about what what i might buy.  here's where it turns into a negative experience for me:  first, parking is nothing short of a holy hell nightmare.  then the sheer volume of things to look at is overwhelming.  i begin to feel exhausted after the first 10 minutes.  msc isn't the place to go to look for something specific; say, a fitted blazer.  i find myself carefully investigating probably 1,000 pieces of clothing to ferret out said blazers.  when i fall upon something i like, my brain-on-overload inevitably (unfairly?) finds some flaw to talk me out of it.  ""$35 is too much for a used leather le sac bag with a sticky zipper"".  ""$36 is too much for a used and somewhat worn looking nordstrom brand blazer.  it's not even a designer name"".  ""what?  $15 for a used t-shirt?""  you get the idea.  i always come in excited and leave disappointed and needing a cocktail.  consigning at msc was a bit of a disappointment, too; though i totally understand that the free market dictates what they can sell my things for.  i do way better selling on ebay, but admit msc is more convenient.  bottom line, i guess i need more from a store when i shop for designer apparel.  even used designer apparel.",0
"sadly z pizza is currently the best slice in downtown. it's ""just fine"" pizza and they have reasonably priced daily slice specials.  take note: this place gets some serious lines during the weekday lunch periods (proof enough these are the best slices in the vicinity).",0
"break out the antiacids - well worth the splurge of calories and disaster it will wreck on your tummy and diet. i don't think you can make a bad choice off the menu - they have mac and cheese on a hot dog for pete's sake! the bun - ah yes, the bun, smothered in butter then grilled. (vegan's faint!) the perfect hang over food - sits on asu campus off forest mall on the western side of hayden library. even dr. crow loves it, so the rumor goes. you will definitely want a nap, tums or lettuce after this, but it's sooooo worth it.",1
"love this place so much!  i looked at a purse here for a year...it was out of my price range.... then won a gift certificate and decided to buy that purse!  i get so many compliments on it!  i've also bought a super slinky 'liquid gold' wallet... some earrings... some cards... some trinkets........  yes, i love this place!",1
"i came here with high hopes-perhaps i'd found my next dive bar. but there's something about this place that didn't quite gel with me, and i can't put my finger on it. the drinks are cheap, and they serve a righteously cold beer. but i guess it's the big, vast feel of the place with the off-putting fluorescent lighting. it gives the place a very bowling alley feel. i don't see this as a place where you and your crew would want to hang for very long. however, if you've been out drinking all night, are short on cash and just need to knock back another one or two before calling it a night while sitting in shameful silence already starting to regret how awful you're going to feel in the morning, this place would be perfect.",0
"i've been going here since the week it opened. the food is better than average, somewhere halfway between authentic mexican and americanized.  i love the salsa selections and the chips are good. the food is nothing spectacular but i will go here on occasion just to get decent mexican food.  try it, you might like it... many people do.",1
"when i lived in arizona, i always traveled to their north phoenix location.  recently i was in tempe and realized they opened one there.  the food was just as good and i was so happy to have my favorite torta the nortena steak torta! i can't wait to visit again when i'm in town.",1

"it's been a year since i was here? it's really been that long? sadly, i'm keeping my rating the same. a whole year & it's still not vibing with me well.  ended up here on a wednesday around 11pm.  we couldn't order food. nothing. zip. nada. the kitchen was closed. it's only 11 & we came over here because the vigs have great late night food. lame the bar had people at it so we cozied up by the fire. romantic. the server was really nice. the music mix was great. music is a big deal for me. the drinks were watered down. bad bad bad! why would a bartender serve cocktails in a pint glass & water them down?! yuck!  both times i've been here they can't get the drinks right. i might never go back for drinks.",0
another a-ok experience at the willow stream spa! a last minute memorial day treat with mani's and pool-time at the willow stream spa that resulted in a nicely relaxation saturday afternoon! the staff was accommodating as usual and the prickly pear lemonade was just exactly what i needed in the rising temperatures. as i sat there enjoying life on the rooftop pool i wondered how hard it would be to put one on my roof. maybe i just need to keep saving for consistent willow stream spa days instead.,1
"i ordered their lunch specialty, prime rib sandwich.  a roast beef sandwich from subway probably has about the same amount of flavor as this thing did.  all i could do to try and awaken my taste buds was lather on some horseradish and au jus...  maybe i picked the wrong item, but when i order a 15$ sandwich i expect quite a bit above average, and this sandwich was average at best.",0
"a wonderful downtown restaurant. although pretty small inside, the food has giant taste! the parking can be a bitch on sunday morning but if you love close it's right off the light rail. they have this delicious salad, i believe it's called a mediterranean or something of that nature. they also have a remarkable grill cheese with brie cheese and scrumptious apple wood bacon. yum! and to top that off they have 3 dollar mimosas. and on occasion you might catch news channel 3's ross shimabuku there.........shhhhh",1
"i just started ""running"" about a year ago.  when i say ""running"" that means i'm working my way up to a 5k from being a fat ass.  anyway, after a few months of running in old shoes my wife talked me into going here and getting ""real"" running shoes and not just whatever sneakers were on sale at the mall.  i was afraid i would be talked into a $200 pair by some salesperson who would make me think they would enable me to run for forever without getting tired.  however, this was not the case at all.  our guy there, brandon, analyzed my running on their treadmill thing and recommended some very reasonable kicks.  they were like $50 or something.  they lasted for like a year and i just went back to see brandon last weekend to get something new.  again he recommended a very good pair that i love so far.  they were pretty inexpensive as well.   right when you walk in the door you will probably be greeted by an overly friendly associate like the moment you step out of your car at a car dealership.  he/she will then try to answer your questions or give you to an employee that works in the particular department of the gear you are looking to purchase.  however, if you are just browsing somebody will probably come up to you every 2 minutes to ask if you need any assistance.  anyway, aside from that, it is a pretty good shopping experience.  it also looks like they have some pretty sweet deals and sales if you are part of their ""club"".  a member of my family is so i use his discount which is usually pretty substantial so if you are a mildly serious runner then i would spring the few bucks to become a member.  their selection of running stuffs seems to be pretty large and comprehensive.  i can't think of anything else i would ever need to run.  looks like there is some pretty advanced stuff there but i doubt i'll ever get to the point of actually needing it.  i plan to return every few months for a new pair and whatever other gear i think i need to run like the wind.",1
"i'm pissed. how can you just stop making grilled cheese? its bread and cheese. how? you have bread, and you have cheese, but you cannot make a grilled cheese?  also, why does it have to be 400 degrees? i know you have a.c. this is az in the summer. it's hot. turn it on.  i don't have a really good basis to draw this conclusion because i rarely order this drink, but your dirty vodka martini is quite possibly the worst i have ever tasted. i had to eat a cheese stick with each bite just to stomach it.  your tater tots were good and my blue moon was reasonably priced. at least you have that going for you.",0
"a few months ago, i was fortunate to be in the valley of the sun for a visit.   i live in this cold place up north now. i am cold and i complain about the temperature and the food.  la barquita is the food that most represents what i miss the most in arizona. warm, unpretentious, inexpensive, honest and good.  in september i noticed that they painted the walls and got new linoleum and i thought back a few years before and remember lupe dreaming about new linoleum, since the floor was stained by the previous owner. the new linoleum is a victory for all who love really good food.  oh? and rosita's? someone i read actually wrote a review saying rosita's was better? are you high honey? rosita's is a 3* uses store bought tortillas and microwaved a few of my taco plates too many. they have a big empty bar with a couple of coyote looking guys and one of my friends likes the shrimp tacos so i went there a few times but the microwave thing and the atmosphere are a bit rough. la barquita is a much better restaurant if you have taste buds or some understanding.  where else in town can you get huevos divorciados or birria or gordonoz fritz? this is the place.  i want a la barquita  red chili pork plate! i can't get it here -they always make it with beef and only a few places i have discovered actually make tortillas from scratch, all of them a cold train ride away.",1

"whenever i get a craving for some distant memory of a food, and that craving won't go away.... i start whining.  so it was yesterday.  i had been sitting all day with my cravings for real hawaiian food for what seemed like weeks. i decided to commiserate with a friend who had grown up in hawaii.  i thought it might make it better.  it was worse.  i started off telling her how i sure could use a big bowl of saiman for lunch, and didn't laulau and kalua pig sound good? pretty soon we were both drooling for lomi lomi salmon and manapua.  i was ready to run all the way across town to mesa.  ""oh, my friend exclaimed, why don't you go to l & l?""  i thought she was kidding.  sure, i'll grab a flight to hawaii this afternoon....   ""no, there is one at happy valley and i-17, across from the lowes.""  needles to say, i spent the rest of the day planning my route home.  i would have to go about 10 miles out of my way, but there wouldn't be traffic.....  l & l doesn't have haoli hawaiian food, they have real hawaiian food.  i walked in to hear the woman ahead of me order a loco moco plate lunch.  there was a big poster advertising that laulau has only 1 carb, and a paper plate hanging on the service pass through proclaiming ""linguica special"" in blue magic marker.  this place has it all.  they have saiman (a hawaiian version of ramen but the noodles and garnishes are more fun), musubi (even with spam), manapua (steamed or fried pork roll), haupia (thick coconut cream desert), poi (pounded taro root), poke (raw tuna seaweed salad), lomi lomi salmon (chopped raw salmon rubbed with chili and onion served with chopped tomatoes), bbq short ribs, and all other sorts of hawaiian favorites.  i had a plate lunch.  a traditional plate lunch has a scoop or 2 of rice made with an ice cream scoop, a scoop of macaroni salad made with lots of mayo and maui onion, and one or 2 main dish items.  mine were laulau and kalua pig.  laulau is pork, butterfish and ti leaves with hawaiian salt, wrapped up in taro leaves and steamed til it can almost melt in your mouth. kalua pig has to be simulated because the traditional cooking method used to achieve the smokey flavor cannot be approved by the usda.  traditional method is a rock lined pit.  the pit is then lined with leaves and the meat (a whole pig) is lowered in then covered with more leaves.  it is then covered to keep the heat in.  i have no idea how they do it, but there is probably smoke flavoring, hawaiian salt, and a large amount of ti leaves involved.  the kalua pig is delicious.  i loved every morsel, and today i have a little leftover vacation to the islands waiting for me at lunch time.",1
"went to this location today to meet friends because it was the closest to the middle of our houses.... thanks good egg for totally ignoring the sw valley :/  i drove here not expecting much (always known this location as the crappy one), i had been to this location while it was still under the forgotten step-child the eggery.  i was surprised that they had finally gotten rid of that name and changed the signage to the good egg (not sure if this is recent or not, i haven't been down this part of camelback in a bit of time).  upon seeing the new signage, i thought perhaps there would be a better experience to be had.... no, nope, not at all.  i met my party that was already seated in the waaaaaay outdated restaurant... i mean seriously people, the bakery cases that haven't been used in decades, the wood, the wallpaper, the metal chairs, and all the brass... oh my goodness all the brass....yuck!..... give this place a little attention good egg.  when i sat down i found half of the table wet and no napkins, a little puzzled i asked what the deal was.  apparently the waiter had spilled the water all over the table and used our napkins to try and wipe it up.... i repeat try to clean it up, he didn't succeed. perhaps if he had went to get a towel he could of gotten all the water up, but apparently he never did (as this happened 10 min. before i got there and there was still puddles all over the table.  nor did he come back with fresh napkins...nice buddy, nice.  after being there for about 5 minutes the guy came to ask if i wanted anything to drink... coffee and cream please. and walks away before we can say that we are ready to order... now i am the ding dong who was a half hour late because my ass slept in, so friends were huunnngggry.....he comes back with coffee (lukewarm at best), no cream, and walks away...again.  we sit, and sit, and sit.  he finally comes and ask if we are ready to order, umm.. we had been there 45 minutes and 15 minutes...yeah, i think we've got it.   we order and remind him again of the cream and napkins.  he comes back with cream, no napkins.  sigh.  food finally comes, order is right, but haphazardly prepared.  maybe the kitchen guy overslept too?    i have the monterrey, it is missing tomatoes and you can tell that it was almost forgotten about because the eggs were starting to brown, my english muffin is nearly burnt and looks like it was toasted on a grill that needs some scrubbing, the cook compensated by soaking it in butter. dollar pancakes were shaped like road kill, and the side plate they came on was placed on my main plate.  that's no big deal, i don't care.  but as i am going fork to plate the server takes the side plate off the main plate...umm...eew, don't touch my food once it has hit the table.  i worked my way through high school and college waiting tables, i have a high tolerance for eew, but some things just bug me right away... this is one of them.  dude, if you touch my food while it is in the kitchen, ignorance is bliss, but if you do it in front of me once the food is on the table for goodness sake then that shit just be nasty yo!  i know damn well there is a good chance your hands aren't clean.  practically no food workers wash their hands as much as they are supposed to unless the health inspector is there....sorry people, its true.  friend 1 had an even more crispy looking omelet.  friend 2 got a turkey sandwich.  it was dry, and lacking in well... turkey! it looked as if they had folded up one piece of lunch meat to make it look more substantial.  her salad was pretty lame looking and had the runniest ranch dressing i had ever seen.  what was even worse is that there was one sad runaway strawberry in her sandwich... wtf? check your cold storage bins people!  if friend 1 had been the one to order the sandwich instead of friend 2 then i wouldn't be writing this review right now because i would be supporting friend 1 in the hospital!! friend 1 has a major strawberry allergy.  i understand shit happens, but how does a strawberry get put on a turkey sandwich and the cook doesn't notice?!??!!!  we could of said something if our server wasn't practicing his disappearing act again. only time we saw him after he dropped off the food was when he dropped the check, and kindly paused out of his busy day to say ""everything ok?"" ...kind of waited for a response and walked away.. no ""thank you"" ""have a good day"" ""come again"" ""bugger off"" nothing....  mind you i use the word ""busy"" lightly, there was about 6 tables in the whole place full at 10am, and at least 4 other servers that i saw.   this was the third time i had been to this location... shitty experience as always, you know what that means people.... three strikes you're out! (oh and the water pitcher that half of which was spilled all over...the water was unfiltered grossness...boo :/ )",0
this time i had their orange bread..... mmmmmmm like home made!!   and again a latte! just like the way they know how to serve it!!,1
i'm hopeful.  as more retailers and restaurants open this area has great potential.  i live and work downtown and have already found the cvs very convenient and i have found a few great items at some of the clothing stores here. i can see it earning an extra star from me once more eateries open.,1
this is one of our go-to mexican places. they have a surprisingly extensive menu with a lot of vegetarian options and of course the classics. their chips and salsa are muy delicioso and their margaritas are yummy. the servers are always consistently great. the only thing i don't like is their guacamole...it's creamy almost like a dip and not my guac style.,1
wow this place is awesome!!!!!!  good healthy choices.  cooked up exactly the way i want it with ingredients i pick and choose from!!! we will be regulars at this place from now on ( and we won't have to break the bank to go often).,1
"there are some mighty fine bbq joints in the phoenix area - this ain't one of them.  the good: the people were friendly and helpful. the restaurant is laid out nicely and clean. the selection of side dishes is good. tasty rolls. they carry big red soda.  the so-so: the ribs, what a shame. the texture and taste seem to indicate they were steamed or boiled. they are fall of the bone soft, but lack anything resembling flavor. my spare ribs had a ton of cartilage.  the bbq sauce was not bad, not inspired, but certainly better than the ribs they were on. the potato salad did more of a service to the bbq sauce than the ribs.  the bad: the price! $19 for a rack of less than mediocre ribs!  i'm not likely to voluntarily return here soon.",0
"now before you rush to judgment let me explain....   after reading many stellar reviews, i thought how can i go wrong. well everyone can have an off night. this was an evening of highs and lows that led me to the 2 star review. if i go back someone else is paying, lets just start right there.   i met some friends for dinner, excited by the reviews and the chance to try a new menu we decided on the vig uptown. we arrived to a crowded lot but no bother they have complimentary valet parking! very nice. it was however a little confusing on how to get in and no one directed us. it wasn't until the massive door like something out of willy wonka's opened that we figured out how to get in. the interior is very trendy and artistically pleasing. the indoor outdoor patio is a nice touch. the booths are huge enough room for at least 6 adults. so far you have me at 5 stars.   our server a little mousy thing finally came trotting over to ask us for a drink order and referred us to the drink menu. stating we have several house specials. my friend and i both fairly savvy when it comes to liquor, spot an item that we are unfamiliar with. so we inquire about the queen's english which boasts a pimm's no 1 cup. we are told she thinks it has cucumber in it but shes not sure. she goes to the bar and returns with the following answer ""it's a liquor"". not quite the answer we were wanting so we just order something else. red beer, stella and vodka martini dirty. ; )   side bar my thinking is if the queen's english is on your specials menu you would like to know what is in it, so that you may better serve your guests. but that's just me. now we are at 4 stars.   we ordered the onion rings and traditional wings. the onion rings were very good but i would have like to have been given something to dip in besides ketchup. bluck. the traditional wings were far from traditional but they were delicious.   on to the entrees, i decided to have the the uptown steak sandwich...charbroiled, sliced bistro tenderloin, with wild mushrooms, caramelized onions, arugula, roasted red peppers, swiss cheese and horseradish mayo on a sub roll. are you freaking kidding me that sounds amazing, i've gotta have it. oh and the bonus sweet potato fries....heck yeah! the fries were some of the best i have ever had. bravo! the sandwich fell short. the bread was very heavy, dry and thick. the horseradish mayo was missing in action, the amount was so small you couldn't taste it. the tenderloin was spot on however, the mushrooms we few and far between. i ended up dumping everything out of the roll.   i tried my friends persian chicken kabob and it had no flavor. she didn't like it either.   i wish our server had been more attentive. i can't tell you who she was she never told us her name. she seemed very inexperienced and we had to wait awhile for water after stopping her as she went by.   all in all not good. i really wish these restaurants would quit focusing on a size 2 female servers and start focusing on a server that has experience and knows their job! the girls are pretty but i am not there to check out servers. i want to check out the food and the service.   ps this place is very loud and more of a bar atmosphere, not a place for kids. i saw a few women with babies well under a year old. this is not a kid friendly restaurant.",0
"the last two times i've been to saddle ranch, it's been disappointing. both times, my group and i arrived during dinnertime and asked to be seated inside for dinner. when we arrived, the entire restaurant was practically empty and yet both times, they told us that the wait was 45 min- an hour due to ""reserved parties."" yet like i said, nobody was there and in the time we were there, i never saw one ""reserved party"" arrive. while the wait to sit inside was 45 min - an hour, coincidentally enough, they always have seating available on the patio which is where they seated everyone who were walk-ins. since we were hungry, we ended up sitting out on the patio and the seats inside remained empty for the majority of the time we were there. do they want people to sit on the patio to make it seem like more people are at saddle ranch then really are? who knows, but when it's that hot it's too to eat outside. i understand that restaurants get crowded, but we've now come to saddle two times and have been told it's too full to be seated inside both times and we could either wait an hour, leave or sit on the patio in 115 degree weather. next time i will probably choose another restaurant to visit when it's time to pause the saturday activities and have a bite to eat in a lively setting. instead, i'll keep this place on my list when i need a spot for a rowdy night out and i don't need sit-down service.",0
"i love tottie's!!  i even came to the restaurant for my prom ""date"" night.  i have been to this restaurant several times for special occasions or birthday parties.  my favorite drink there is the thai iced tea, but their regular iced tea is also extraordinary.  this is by far my favorite restaurant.  the owner is very warm and sincere.  she even comes by the tables when she isn't cooking to greet her customers.  the food sometimes is a bit pricey, but the food is worth it.  it is authentic food, not overly processed soggy asian food you get at some other places.  if you are wanting to go to have real food, with quality service and a nice atmosphere, go to tottie's.  :)",1
"i was unimpressed. i've heard great things about this place, but perhaps the hype made me expect more. i went with a girlfriend for a saturday brunch. we sat outside and that patio area is as nice as a patio facing a parking lot can be. we split an order of eggs benedict with potatoes and the morning glory omelet with fruit. the eggs benedict was standard. the omelet was okay, but i've had better in much smaller establishments. for the price we paid, i expected better.",0
"cheap drinks, friendly service and absolutely fantastic people watching! this place has two sides, one has a live band; the other has pool and sometimes a dj. they have different drinks/beers on each side. i've sat on both sides, and you'll see everything from a suite jacket to hardcore biker attire on the men...and t-shirts & jeans to those skimpy little skirts on skinny and not so skinny bodies for the ladies. overall, a really good dive bar, good pizza, and a great place to hang-out.",1
"i was all enthused after reading the great reviews on yelp.  this place is run by a nice family and it is clean.  that being said,  this is not your top-notch chinese food.  if any yelpers have been to ny or san francisco, you know what amazing chinese food is. i ordered shrimp with lobster sauce which came with chicken because according to the waitress/owner, ""we don't use msg so we use chicken for flavor"". good idea not to use msg but my shrimp dish should not have chicken in it because i didn't order a combo dish.  i also found chunks of whole garlic which i had to spit out.  traditionally, shrimp with lobster sauce does not have ginger as a flavoring.  lots of ginger which in most chinese dishes is great but not lobster sauce. my partner had orange chicken which consisted of large pieces chicken on a bed of duck sauce.  did not see any evidence that orange peels were used as is traditional in this dish.  my partner thought the chicken had too much crust.  i tasted it and thought the  crust was fine.  ordered pork potstickers (dumplings) and the dumpling dipping sauce was vinegary.  this is your average chinese place and i can't understand how in the world it could be best of phoenix?!  i am sorry i wasted the gas to get there.   nice people, less than average food.   and service, well, there is one person for all the tables.",0
"as an expat hawaii guy, my family still loves ""plate lunch"" kind of foods.  so although aloha kitchen does not have great food, it normally is a relatively decent and passable place for us to pick up some plates when we are craving plate lunches and are too lazy to cook ourselves.  but in my opinion, this place is slowly getting worse.  the slight price increases are understandable and that is not the problem.  the problem is that they hire all these young kids who are sometimes more interested in farting around than paying attention to business.    so yesterday my wife and  daughter wanted plate lunch stuff so they called in the order and called me at work to go pick the food up.  my wife warned me that i should open each box to make absolutely sure that the order was correct, since the last three times they screwed something up.  so when i got there, the food was ready and already all packed up.  i wanted to check the boxes, but the girl said the order was all there and read the order back to me.  since she said the order was all there, i took her word for it and took the boxes home.  upon getting home, my wife opened up the boxes and two out of four of the boxes were wrong.  yeah, the entrees were seemingly correct, but the salads and sides were all wrong.  boy did my ass get chewed by my wife for being so stupid for trusting  those young dufess kids!!  further, my wife ordered the hot wings for her meal and the wings were not hot wings -- they were more like honey glazed wings and my wife said that they either changed the recipe or made a mistake.  my daughter ordered the bulgoghi, and that order was correct but apparently the meat was over-soaked in the soy marinade and it was super salty, super dark, and the meat was disintegrating due to being marinated for too long.  the order for teri-chicken was ok, but the order for fried saimin was disappointing.  the menu and the history of this dish at this place (like 25+ years) says that one of the condiments on the noodles is slivered char siu (sweet red roast pork).  but there was no char siu in the dish, only slivered, old, left-over, over-marinated bulgoghi....maybe that is why our bulgoghi meal was not very good -- they had a lot of old, leftover, over-marinated meat so they gave it to us and used some of it on the fried saimin.  there have been many competitors to aloha kitchen open hawaiian style plate lunch places but most, if not all of them have gone under.  but as a plate lunch expert and aficionado, i can tell you that a good plate lunch place will be a gold mine here.  not only expat hawaiians and lovers of plate lunch foods, but even the other people will love those kind of menu items.  the problem with the other places and aloha kitchen as well, is that the food is not that good, and the menu choices are not typical of authentic plate lunch choices.  i understand the issue of cost control and menu standardization, but menu choices can be increased by  changing the menu for different days of the week, or, having a new special of the day each day.  oh well, what do i know?  i have only run about 30 large corporations and small businesses successfully, so my ideas and opinions must be worthless!",0
"lovely little space--the cafe is an old repurposed phoenix home with plenty of patio space.  very quaint.  the service was super friendly, and the seating areas were comfortable with enough privacy to have conversation.   i enjoyed their weekend brunch with mimosa's. food was solid breakfast fare with medium sized portions.  most of the dishes had a slight mexican flare (chorizo with the eggs benedict, corn tortillas on the side, etc). my boys got the ""miga"" eggs and their exact review was: i like these eggs, they are delicious. so there you go - positive reviews from a picky 5 year old.  the adults enjoyed their meals too. i do wish their mimosa glasses were a bit larger - but that is probably just the boozer in me talking. the prices were more than fair. overall enjoyable experience!",1
"let me start by saying whatever happened to cooking christmas dinner? i am jewish, so for me christmas= chinese food, but apparently the secret is out. i went here tonight with the bf. we had made reservations for 7:30 and arrived at 7:20. the place was clearly understaffed as the two hostesses were running around like crazy acting as waitresses and bussers in addition to trying to host. as we stood there waiting for our table, about half of the tables in the restaurant left. you would think that this would make for a quick seating....surprise! it didn't. we waited for about 30 minutes to be seated. additionally, several tables who did not have reservations were seated at the same time as us, which would have been fine if there were people working at this restaurant, but there weren't. so the bf and i sit there. the couple (without res) gets water, some small family that was seated at the same time gets water....we get nothing. the waitress comes around and takes their orders. nothing. the family gets their appetizers and the waitress comes and takes their main entree order. nothing. the other table gets their beers and sushi...still nothing! the hostess finally came by after at least twenty minutes and took our orders....we still do not have water. for real. and the place has gotten significantly less busy at this point. so we order the tangerine chicken and the pad kee mao with a 7/10 spiciness. we waited and waited. the other couple received entrees and just about finished them before we got our food. it was like we were in an episode of seinfeld or something. the service was that bad.   we (finally) get our food and i will admit, the tangerine chicken was tasty. it was sweet and savory...pretty good. the problem is it was luke warm...like it had been sitting for awhile. not cool. the pad kee mao was a disaster. first, it had about a 1-2 star spiciness level. not spicy....at all. second, in addition to not being spicy it was bland and kind of tasted like dishwater. third, the veggies were still essentially raw. the dish was terrible. i have had much better (real) thai food for a fraction of the price. we barely touched the dish, but no one showed us any concern or asked if our food was alright. the entire ordeal lasted one and half hours...for just entrees and water. overall, the experience was terrible.   i know what you're thinking....but jennifer, it's christmas!... yes, i know it's christmas, but i don't care, it isn't an excuse. i made a reservation. if they they did not have the space, they should have a) not given us a reservation or b) not let in walk ins when they had reservations. whoever owns this restaurant should have put more thought into staffing for a night that they knew would be busy because they took reservations! it was unacceptable. the place only got a second star because the tangerine chicken was good, but i would be hesitant to go here again because apparently my business means nothing to this restaurant.",0
"after hearing nothing but rave reviews of america's taco shop, it was time to give it a try. i ordered their ""best carne asada in town"" tacos. and i beg to differ. there are plenty of places i have had better carne asada. i'm going to blaspheme according to some, but i've had better carne asada at chipotle, for meat's sake. i thought the meat was overcooked. i have yet to find somewhere that comes close to comedor guadalajara for carne asada. the side of beans was ok.  the staff was courteous and friendly, the service was great. but, i really don't see what the big deal is about america's taco shop. after all the hype, i expected it to be great. but it was good, at best. with a menu as limited as america's taco shop has, they should excel at what little they do offer and that's just not the case.",0
"we bought a ""living social"" coupon thing for this place.  we're always up for trying new bbq!  we got the brisket with the coupon, plus got some sausage links and pulled pork.  plus the sweet tea.  the tea was very good (though my wife thought it was too sweet...it was just the way i like it).  the brisket, while it had a nice smoke ring, had very little smokey flavor.  and basically no seasoning.  the sausage link was ""just a sausage"".  no smokiness, nothing special.  the pulled pork was drowned in sauce, so i can't say if it was smokey or not.  the flavor of the pork was ok.  not great.  just ok.  two stars is ""i've experienced better"".  and i have.  dave's bbq is better.  rudy's is much better.  and joe's is vastly better.  texas bbq house is not bad, but it's not particularly good either.  i've certainly had worse bbq, but there is much better available.  so why go here (unless it's just that it's convenient to where you are)?",0
"i came here for a pre-meeting spot for a workshop. there's an art gallery next door which it's connected to, so you can take a look at the work. it's very quaint with a funky menu written in scrabble letters.there are a few couches and tables to hang out at. i ordered my usual, an iced latte with almond milk. the coffee was high quality and the flavor was right. i noticed they had pour over coffee, which looked similar to a slow drip, where the barrista was consistently pouring hot water over. it looked interesting, and will be what i will try next.",1
"am i stuck in some weird dream?  are we really at a table in the aisle of a wine store with a shopping cart seated at the head of the table? (yes, see photo)  (***update*** yelp decided almost 2 years later that my photo of the inside of the restaurant was ""specific to my experience"" and therefore ""not appropriate for the general business listing""...yelp is too funny...)  did the store clerk really just tell me to not get my good trusted bottles of wine and instead suggest three of the most putrid wines i've ever had?  does the menu really have the phrase ""in season"" in quotes, as if the food isn't really in season but they are pretending it is?  are there really people in this ""restaurant"" (see the use of quotes there?) loudly cheering for the iowa warhawks game?  was i really just served cold duck confit?  am i really eating it?  did they really just charge me $10/bottle corkage fee on wine i paid for at the cash register 5 feet away?  did i really just wait 20 minutes for someone to take my credit card?  2 stars because *overall* the food was good (even if my duck was cold).",0
"as a beer nerd, i really wanted to love sunup!  a couple buddies, and i, stopped in here around 9pm on a thursday night (last night)... and the first thing we noticed was the decor.  very cool looking place!  funny signs, unique paint job, barrels turned into advertisements... and the ambiance was low-lit and quiet with pretty good tunes piping in.  we asked to be seated on the patio where we could smoke a couple cigars and the patio is really cool!  the place is split in half by the patio that occupies the center of their lot... and it's got murals, more signs, and it's covered with misters.  nice!  all beer nerds, we started by ordering a sampler of all their beers... and worked our way through their cask ale and cider too.  i think we tasted almost everything they had!  one or two were pretty good... the cask was decent... and their brewmaster obviously loves hops (just a warning if you're not into hoppy beers).  all in all, though, nothing jumped out as amazing - doubtful any of these beers are going to win any awards in their current states, ya know?  i ordered some nachos and my buddies got some honey-hot wings based on our waitress's recommendations...... but she came back to tell us they were out of wings.  on a thursday night?  hope your shipments come on friday mornings or whoever does your ordering should be admonished...  bummer.  she suggested ordering chicken fingers and she'd have the cooks toss them in the same sauce... so they went with that.  when the food came, the nachos were pretty good... chicken fingers were okay... and sweet potato fries were fantastic (seasoned very well)!  none of the food was anything to rave about... but good bar grub style food that filled us up while we drank.  when we first sat down, we asked what time they closed since we were arriving so late... and they told us the kitchen was done at 10 and they close at 11.  no problem, we thought...... couple hours to grab some bar grub and knock back a few beers - then we can head up the street to another bar to close out the night.  well...... when they say, ""we close at 11,"" they mean 11 on the dot!  despite the 8 customers just on the patio (i dunno how many more were inside, if any), two gals literally came out at 11 and said, ""we're closed, everyone.  you'll have to leave now,"" as they turned off the lights and started putting up chairs around us.  wow!  i was about 3 sips into a beer that just arrived 15 minutes ago... and she looked at it and even had the audacity to say, ""aw, bummer.  you didn't get to finish that last one, huh?""  are you serious?!  yep... they were... and 11:04 we were all out the door and they locked it behind us.  look...... i understand closing time...... but that generally means that's when you stop serving new customers and you usually have at least 30 minutes to finish up.  not here, you don't.  you need to plan on being done by 10:30, at the latest, so you can pay, clean up your plate, finish your last beer, etc...... because they're ridiculous about the 11pm mark.  very unwelcoming.  the beer is okay... the food is okay... the atmosphere is cool... but being kicked out with full beers definitely dropped this from a 3-star (cuz it was just okay, anyway) to a 2-star spot, in my book...... and i doubt i'll ever be back.",0
"i was very pleasantly surprised as i walked in.  it was a hot, bright sunny summer afternoon and what a nice contrast was provided.  this place was dark and cool (my wife said she was freezing, but she always is) and it reminded me of a 100 year old bar in san francisco.  think dark wood, red velvet drapes, chandeliers and upholstered furniture.  the menu is small but inspired.  the portions are small but the prices very reasonable.    the drinks were quite creative with exotic ingredients, but at about $12 each, they should be something special.    why just 2 stars??    the service was just insanely slow.    everything took for-ev-er.   when we were seated, another couple was nearby.  they said, ""get comfortable, you will be here for a really long time""     we ordered 2 drinks and 2 simple appetizers.  my drink took about 15 minutes.  my wife's drink followed about 10 minutes later.  the 2 sliders and a tiny flatbread took close to an hour from when we ordered.  we ordered another round of drinks about one hour into our stay.    meanwhile, the other couple was waiting and waiting and waiting to pay.  they had been there over 2 hours but did not want to be, that's just how long it took.   finally, they went and got a menu,  calculated their own bill, added the estimated tax and just left a pile of cash asking us to explain it in the unlikely event the server ever returned.  she came around and after waiting 45 minutes for the second drinks that never came, i just handed her my cash and said  ""i'm leaving"".    we were there over 2 hours and half of our stuff never even arrived.   that is the thing i can stand the least: leaving a restaurant feeling angry at the waste of your time, the contempt shown for your enjoyment and wondering why a night of your life was wasted hoping for some server to grace you with their glance.     we went home, warmed up some leftovers and made our own drinks.",0
"here's the universal truth: all veggie dogs suck. really, really hard. there are no good ones. therefore, the toppings and bun of a veggie dog must be really spectacular to make it an enjoyable. short leash succeeds at this with all their creative combos and delicious naan. i've tried a few at their truck, but i'll always be partial to the first one i ever tried, the igby. the spicy barbecue sauce, coleslaw and blue cheese makes my mouth water.  at the restaurant, i was finally able to try the green tomato stack, something i've been seeing on instagram all summer. it definitely lived up to the hype, and i'm sure the bacon i left off takes it over the top. i'm glad they had some dos cabezas wine on tap, but it would be great to see their 4 item wine selection expanded.  sit...stay is a great option for downtown dining. if they could somehow come up with a tasty, housemade veggie dog, i'd give them a million glittery stars.",1
"daisies on our table were already wilted when we sat down for dinner at 5:30 and may have been ominous of the inattention to detail that may have evolved here.  waiter apparently cannot recite any of the beer selection and  tells my older friend to look on the drink menu for options. aside from the disrespect, it is truly hard to read the menu in the eve ambience lighting here.  bruschetta is poor and bread isn't toasted. when did their great bread selections drop off? not one of my friends impressed by their spongy bread. salad was good. cheese platter is a bit sparse for $14.  thus the service was poor, food below average and interior gorgeous, except for overflowing toilet.",0
"i was disappointed.  i have not been to a sweet tomatoes restaurant for about 3-4 years due to their higher prices, but i went to join a friend for lunch on friday.  their pricing is still high -- about $12 for lunch and a standard drink.    the salad selection was sparse.  a few green salad types and additives.  dressings were thin and not very tasty.  toppings were sparse -- no cold cuts of chicken, pepperoni, nor any bacon crumbles.  and even the soups were not very hearty or tasty.  i remember them being better some years ago.  i think i will stick with the salad bars at soupersalad!, golden corral, or even sizzler's.  better salads and better prices.",0
"tempe diablo stadium opened in 1969, but the los angels angels didn't start making full use of the facility until 1992. this is a nice ballpark, but the best time to get to the park is early. why? because parking becomes crazy the later you arrive.   it's a great park to attend if you want to watch the team work out and get some pictures and autographs with your faves. the players walk along from the stadium to the huge practice field and vice-versa and anywhere between there is easy access for autograph seeking. word of warning: manager mike scioscia requests the fans walk along with him as he's going from one place to another. this doesn't bode well because people run to catch him and more times often than not someone gets hurt.  other than this, it's a pretty decent area to hang until the players trek back into the stadium for drills on the field.   their team shop for souvenirs is a bit small and gets crowded fast. i found a good bargain in there the day i went and came away with an angels visor for $6.50, which i got autographs on that same day, so not a bad souvenir to pick up to support the team.   the guest services people at the stadium are really helpful and friendly so don't hesitate to ask them anything you may need or are looking for.",1
"i hate to leave a bad review but i have given this ace quite a few chances and have never been impressed. i really wanted to like this place but i just can't. the other dry bar place that is in the valley is just a step above this one. the massage scalpes are ao much better, the environment, drinks they provide and most importantly the blow out. i wld think twice before going here for a special event or maybe try going here first and finding someone you like when you re not getting ready for a special event",0
"allow me to be an asshole for a moment while i write this terrible review. maybe its because it was monday, and raining.. maybe it was because i was in the mood for humble pie and not mexican grill.. maybe its because restaurants in arizona don't have the freshest sea food in the united states of america, whatever it was, i hated this place.   i have this habit of asking my server what their favorite thing on the menu is.. and usually i go with it. i am adventurous, i like surprises.. so homegirl suggested the nachos or the seared ahi tacos.. so what do i do? i ordered a taco plate. since i like variety, i mixed and matched and went with a fish & pork taco with black beans. the ahi tasted wicked old and nasty fishy. i almost spit it out, but i am a lady and that is rude. the pork was very undercooked.. i don't know about you, but i have absolutely no interest in catching trichinosis. i can think of better ways to spend my day than with nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, and abdominal discomfort.. sorry those are not things i am interested in, thanks anyway though. beans were served cold and i swear the rice they served was something out a box from the dollar store. my dog could make better rice than that. there was shit floating in my water and the limes i asked for were so dried out that not one drop of juice came out. seriously? cut up some fresh ones.. its the little things that count.   service was slow, but the chick was nice enough. one of the girls i went with knew one of the managers, who was supposed to hook us up with an employee discount, but conveniently forgot about us at the end.. but what are you gonna do, nothing is free anymore.   i dunno, i just wasn't impressed. the only thing i dug about this joint were the tiles on the wall.. and im certainly not going to return to a place to stare at a wall.   next!",0
"*burp* you know you have to put the guilt aside when it's lunch with your girlfriends.  more so when dottsy suggested matt's.   it was my first time, i remember it like it was yesterday.  or, a half hour ago. sign-in at the door to wait to be seated.  gorgeous day out, so no big deal.  i took a seat on the bench outside and waited for dottsy.  then a lady sat at the other end of the bench and my side flipped up.   i had heard it was small...but not *this* small!  it was really cute and the staff was super-friendly.  i had to pee, though.  apparently, the bathroom was off the kitchen.  ok.  i hope to myself as i make my way past the grills that i am not posing a health hazard to matt's.  i mean, i was wearing a baseball cap, but no net!  bathroom was tiny with no mirror.  that was ok for me, because, as i stated, it was baseball cap day.  the bathroom and its location are the only reason i took a star off. i got the cheddar and mushroom omelet.  came with a side of hash browns and toast.  with a little cup of jelly.  at first, i didn't know it was jelly...until dottsy saw a man put his little cup-o-stuff on his toast.  omelet was huge, as was the hash brown.  the omelet was stuffed.  stuffed with cheese and mushrooms.  i could see the butter on the plate.  oh, man, this was gonna rock!  the hash brown was made from spaghetti-cut potatoes. mmmmmmmmmmmyummy! i ate it all.  everything.  i mean, i waited a half hour to be seated.  and my 20-year high school reunion isn't until july.  so, that's ok that i cleaned off my plate.  right?  right???? oh, and i ran into dallas there.  always a plus!",1
tenderloin sandwich.  boring.  ok piece of meat yet served on a hamburger bun.  no topping or condiment.  thin slice of onion and leaf of lettuce is supposed to dress this up?  skip this sandwich.,0
"after a 5 mile run this evening, good friend and running partner, yvonne, decide we were worthy of a little festive snack. we decided to stop in and order a fallen angel pizza. pizza was perfect! scoops of caramel and butter pecan gelato was just the only way to end a great evening. waitress and service were awesome as always. this is a perfect restaurant for lunch, dinner, dessert, or just a kewl spot to meet a friend for coffee and conversation.lgo...love it! cheers***",1
"wow. like a lot. we drove here from mesa because of the yelp reviews and it being featured in the yelp email, and let me say that it was well worth the drive! my partner thought i was nuts driving all the way to laveen for ice cream, but after our experience here even she admitted i did good!  the owner was there and spent a good 20 minutes getting us to try pretty much every flavour they had. i nearly had a meltdown trying to pick what i wanted. the salted caramel was a perfect blend of sweet and salty, the german chocolate cake was amazing, the red velvet was the next best thing to having the real thing. the sorbet was refreshing and not too sweet. i ended up opting for the cookie monster, because it's blue and cotton candy flavoured, and i have a strange affinity for both. my partner went for the strawberry cheesecake and it was just about perfect. by checking in with yelp we got free upgrades to a waffle cone, and mine was still warm!!!   the owner was extremely personable and answered all our questions. he ran back and forth, getting us samples of the flavours they had in the back. he explained why they use illinois milk instead of arizona milk (it's interesting... ask him about it!).   we sat outside, ate our ice cream and watched as a large group went in... to make their own ice cream! what a perfect, unique date, or something to do for a kid's birthday party.   i will happily make the trek up there anytime for this homemade ice cream with some of the most unique flavours i've had!",1
"some things never change.. unfortunately, ra on mill ave. is one of them.   i went the other night for a graphic design networking event which involved drink tickets and my god, the bartenders could not have been more pissed that i ordered anything other than beer with them. if i would have known a long beach ice tea was such a pain in the ass i would have stuck with $1 happy hour sake & sopporo, but whatever. sushi there is mediocre, i had a few different rolls, and nothing seemed very fresh. i cant say it was bad, but i've had much better in the valley. i think the appeal of this place is the happy hour specials they offer.. they do have good deals but overall i think ra cares more about image than good service & quality food.",0

"my first and likely last visit at this local meat market ( i mean bar). the only reason i went was out of curiosity and a free drink or appetizer for yelp check in.  if you are single, 40's and enjoy a place where you have to scream at someone who is 2 feet away so they can hear you, enjoy  lounge entertainment, this may be the place for you.  i do have to say the waitresses are super cute and there outfits are very easy on the eyes.   i had the dirty martini with blue cheese olives ( you have to ask for those) it was not dirty at all, so she brought me some olive juice which i shared with another patron.  the mushroom and tenderloin flatbread was tasty. the shrimp martini tasted processed, chicken on a stick and tuna was disgusting and were sent back. so, 1 out of 4 appetizers hit the mark? i prefer 3 or 4 out of 4.  on a positive note, the mango mojito martini was very good. that would be the only thing to bring me back. if you go, i hope your experience was better than mine.  or and one more thing.... valet parking for $6 bucks for a center that has only a handful of shops open?? suck it! i will drive a block if i have to rather than get !@#^ in the a$$ by paying some douche canoe to park my car when the place is empty.    cheers...",0

"i used to frequent this place but have not gone in over a year. i went here the other day and the place was dead. it looks like it is going to go out of business. it was i2 in the afternoon and there wasn't one person behind the counter working and no one was eating inside. i could have robbed the place and no one would have known. i walked in and two guys lazily came out but no one greeted me. the grille wasn't even turned on. i'm sorry but i had no patience to wait 30 minutes for them to make me a fallafel and french fries because the fryers and grill was turned off due to a lack of customers. i just walked out of there and no one proceeded to stop me or ask me if they could help me. the menu was also different and worse. the previous menu had combo platters and prices, this one just had pictures of food with no prices attached or lists.  i can tell this particular branch is going out of business. they had no customers.  it's sad because two years ago, this place was packed and thriving.",0
"i'm a huge fan of upward projects restaurants/concepts.  this is my local postino, and i've been coming here since it opened a couple years ago.  the crowd is a good mix of central phoenicians--ranging from the young and hip, to the middle aged and upscale.  the staff and service are great.  knowledgeable about the wines they serve, and excited about the menu items.  check it out on mon or tues after 8pm for the $20 bottle and board special.",1

"we tried coup des tartes last weekend with the groupon they offered. we had heard it was a decent byob restaurant and figured it was worth a try.  i am so happy we did!!!   the appetizers or ""small plates"" were the best part of the meal. we ordered the salmon pate special, the onion tart, and the brie. the salmon pate was amazing! i was worried when i ordered it thinking there were so many ways it could come out badly, but it was incredible. the consistency was perfect and it came with a nice assortment of vegetables and crackers. even better than the salmon, was the brie. omg, just perfect. i thought it wouldn't be any better than what i could buy in the cheese section of trader joe's, but boy was i wrong. it was cooked perfectly covered in baked apples and just so tasty.  the worst appetizer of the three, but still really nice was the onion tart. the only reason i didn't care as much for it because it was on the sweeter side. for our entree we split a filet. the filet was really nice, but not anything that stood apart from anywhere else.   i would recommend coming to coup des tartes for the adorable atmosphere, wonderful small plates, and to bring your own bottle! if you go for this, you cannot go wrong!!!",1
"summer doldrums perhaps?  i have been to st. francis a number of times and generally the food has been quite delightful until last night --a friend and i went for dinner--and enough things weren't right to write a review and wave a little warning flag.  my friend ordered several sides--among them were the fingerling potatoes and roasted vegetables--now when i think of roasted vegetables--i think of eggplant, squash, peppers, asparagus--but only beans and corn??  i don't think so--for the price it seemed very skimpy and not very imaginative or creative which i know the st. francis can do.  she also ordered the fingerling potatoes--which were underdone and flavorless--this after they had been forgotten on the order and attempt made to foist a bowl of soup on my friend instead.  i ordered the white fish--which was okay but not great and was served at a temperature of somewhere between not warm and cool.  the restaurant was not terribly busy--so perhaps this was just an off night--if you can't get the simple things right like roasted vegetables and potatoes--there is something wrong in the kitchen.",0
"i can't believe i have lived near little chicago for over 5 years and just tried it....i was really missing out!  i have driven past it numerous times, but it is located in a run down strip mall, so i never thought to stop.  but my friends karen & kyle had been telling me how good it was, we even tried to order it one day with them, but it was on memorial day or something so they were closed.  well last night i got it in my head that i just had to have some pizza, i hadn't ordered pizza delivery in over 2 years, but then i remembered about little chicago!  they not only have pizza, but also hot and cold subs and some pasta dishes.  i went with a hawaiian style pizza and a side of friend zucchini.  wow, i was blown away, the pizza was thin, crisp and had just the right ratio of sauce to cheese (i am a light on the sauce kind of girl).  the crust had a really nice flavor, everything melded together so well, i was hooked!  then i tried the zucchini, and oh my goodness, some of the best fried zucchini ever!  they were cut thick and had a well seasoned coating, they were so good dunked in some of the cool ranch that came on the side.  i think my little chicago experience is going to be the first of many!",1
"dissappointed. i've necer had chicken cooked as hard as my pollo pizziola was today. it tasted pretty good but was very tough! others in our party were unhappy with the wings - too few per order, hot wasnt hot - calamari was not good. the only thing anyone was happy with was the burgers.",0
"went with a group of friends on saturday night.  yes, there was a huge book of songs.    it was my first time singing karaoke... which means i needed a lot of drinks in me.  they kept the martinis coming, but i can't tell you if they were good or not, because i was pretty drunk.  we ordered food too, but i was too excited to sing to eat any of it.  but it mostly disappeared, so it must of been okay.   i put 4 songs on my piece of paper, but was only called on once in the 4 hours we were there.  they said there was a rotation, but others got to sing more than a few times and everyone in my group only got to sing once.  i felt like they were giving the 'regulars' more songs.    also, it was a saturday night and the 'regulars' were all singing country songs and showtunes.  i was practicing all week, i wanted to sing!!!! and their slow songs were boring me.  so hopefully there are other options in the valley for karaoke, it did feel pretty awesome singing and dancing on the stage, in a drunken stupor and i'd like to do it again sometime.   if i end up here again, perhaps i will change my review, but i'll never go here again on a saturday night.",0
"this is a beautifully built outdoor mall with such an urban feel. the quad has a fun water fountain area where children come to play and the adults can lounge in the chairs and sunbath. the luxurious ipic theaters upstairs is a great choice for a nice night out with friends or a fun date night. salt lounge in ipic has these unique liquid nitrogen drinks (so cool how they look like they're smoking) and uses all fresh ingredients.  tanzy next door has an amazing sunday brunch with bottomless mimosas and a chef's pancake station. there's also a fantastic happy hour monday thru friday with awesome drink specials and a mobile carving station.  it's very unique!  lululemon, express, kitty,h&m, paper source, make meaning, l'occitane, west elm, and apple are some of the amazing retailers in the center.  there's also a popular stingray sushi with their busy outdoor bar area and the talented dry bar.  overall, i love this center. all of the employees are friendly and it has a nice community feel, and that truly tops it off.",1
"upper crust is going through a major identity crisis. on the door it says ""patio lounge and wine bar"" which makes you think of postino or some upscale snooty place, but before you even walk in you can see all the tvs showing sporting games through the windows. are you a sports bar or a wine bar? and then you feel like you're in the middle of new york when you're sitting down and looking at the red and white checkered tablecloths and old school photos. but, there's no denying that the food is pretty tasty.  we had the mediterranean salad to share, and a pizza with sausage and sun dried tomatoes. the chef was a little stingy on the sausage; i definitely could have used more. someone else in our party ordered the pasta with meat sauce and it was pretty delicious. not my favorite pizza but definitely near the top.",1
"i was tempted to grab a grass skirt and wiggle into hula's for their tiki time happy hour (monday - friday 3:30-6pm). but i opted for the phoenix summer staple: a sundress and flip-flops. love the mid-century modern feel. that gets a star :)  it was around 5:30pm and it was busy, but our server came over and took our drink orders when she saw us join a friend's table. i asked for malibu and pineapple and my friend zombie'd out. we were given menus and she left without clearing any plates on our table, where our friends had several (not to mention a couple empty glasses).  she came back with the zombie and told me they didn't have malibu (what a disgrace to tikiville's everywhere!!) but the bartender said i wouldn't know the difference and to bring me this. she set it down. i looked at her and said, ""no, thanks."" automatic minus two stars - one for not having malibu and another one for trying to pass the fake crap off.  i ordered the surfrider chicken sticks and steak tacos while my friend ordered the mango chicken caesar (someone else in our party had ordered it and enjoyed it). she didn't take our menus and all of our drink glasses were empty. a few comments were made about this.  ten minutes later, we get the surfrider chicken sticks which were set on top of my menu (damn, really??). they were cold. decent, but cold nonetheless. my friend's salad came and i was told it would be a minute for the tacos. another 20 minutes and they still hadn't come. not to mention my empty plate sitting on top of a menu, empty water glass and my friend's empty glass.  a couple friends got up to leave and their empty plates and glasses remained even after we got our check. i was billed for the tacos but i never got them. it took another 10 minutes for her to return with a correct bill.   awful service, cold food, no food and a fake-malibu serving bartender give this place one star in my book.",0
"this place sucked and i don't feel the need to return. friends from work were planning a birthday happy hour and called two weeks ago to find out information on providing a location for the event. approximately 20 people would be coming and the person making the call asked if that would be an issue and if reservations needed to be made. she was told no, it would be fine. the restaurant is very spacious, so it could easily handle a group that size.   my friend and i arrived first yesterday to secure the tables. the hostess said she didn't think she could accommodate us because they did have several parties that made reservations. she hesitated, but eventually said she could probably put about 15 in one area, which we accepted. it took a while, but the staff assembled three or four tables to provide the area we needed. we went ahead and sat down and my friend asked the waiter when happy hour began and what specials they had. the waiter stated the happy hour was only in the bar area or patio, and not at the tables. he left and then a manager came out and repeated the same thing. my friend asked what if people walked to the bar, ordered and paid for the drink and returned to the table. the manager said no, you can't do that. we explained there would be people at the table eating in the restaurant portion, but there might be people order drinks from the bar and come back. the manager said if that were to happen, he couldn't hold the tables for us. while the explanation was occurring the waiter was kind enough to bring out some water for us, and a third member of our party showed up to order a diet coke and was planning on getting the quesadilla, but waited. soon it became clear this place would not work out too well for the party.  looking over the menu, the prices seemed too high for a bar with a bull in inside. $10 burgers, egg rolls for $9, $8 quesadillas, $10 salads and $9 specialty drinks.  happy hour prices the specialty drinks come down to $5, imports and well drinks for $3 and domestics for $2 - but again, only in the bar and only in the first-come-first-serve patio area.  if you have a large group, you most likely won't be to be in one of those areas or see those prices.  i do know some restaurants keep the happy hour prices contained to certain areas, but it typically depends on the restaurant structure. a place, for example applebees, is mostly restaurant and happens to have a bar, so it would make sense to keep the prices separate. cadillac ranch is more bar than restaurant. i don't know too many places trying to promote a nice restaurant image that would have a mechanical bull in main area.  apparently the management is not interested in the revenue that 15-20 people eating and drinking all night would generate.  after the manager's conversation, the waiter was a little slow in returning. i walked down to san felipe but they could not accommodate our party at the last minute. in the end, we found a suitable location that provided the service, the happy hour pricing and atmosphere we wanted.  thanks, cadillac ranch, but no thanks.",0
"i finally checked it out and i think its my least favorite of the fox restaurants.  its like the little caesars of fancy pizza.  i'll actually take little caesars next time since i can get more than double the food...  upon further reflection, it tastes kind've like grade school cafeteria pizza..",0
"i""m a fan, i like it i love it i'll eat more of it.  this place has the biggest duck menu i have seen.  if you want to put a chinese restaurant to the test try their peking duck.    what can i say price is important this is not a $5.00 all you can eat, but the lunch menu give a great value. for under $8.00 you can get a large meal.    i like the servers they are short to speak but know their menu and everything is prepared with speed.  this location has its slow times, but if you look close its a big restaurant and even has a back room.    my fav i would say the egg fu young brings me back, it must be the gravy.",1
"this place is quirky and perfect and 5 stars deliciousness. the lamb manti was divine. the combo of cilantro and mint gave it a fresh kick. we also enjoyed the pickled shrimp with fennel dish. my only complaint but it wont affect ""stardom"" is that the wines were way overpriced. be sure to make a reservation and enjoy the culinary ride.",1
"i think this place is a lot of fun.  it's in a nice complex that's not your standard strip mall.  i've been 2x and both times were fun for dates.  they had live music...and a good wine & beer selection (not just bud light).  i have not had too much food so will not comment.  the atmosphere is cool -  sofa and chairs, a bar...or standard tables.  but, it's a funky cool place.............and we just don't get that too much in chandler.",1
"i am so angry with you, chompie's!!!  my sister and i were craving a chompie's bagel so we swing by the pv mall location to pick some up.  we were in there for over 20 minutes and exited without a bagel and without our number being called.  we pulled #29 and it was on #26 the entire time we were in there... and when we would try to ask what was going on, we were shunned!  shunned?  i was trying to ask if we need to stand somewhere specific, ask why people coming in after us were already home eating their bagels.  but i couldn't even get that far.  this goldstein is going somewhere else from now on.  well, maybe.... chompie's bagels are so good, at least they used to be, i wouldn't know because i never got one!",0
"after reading the yelp reviews, we had been looking forward to trying this place. we were not disappointed.  we had dinner there on a weeknight. eventually we'll get around to trying the sunday brunch everyone raves about. i had the ribeye and my wife had the rack of lamb. everything was excellent, though the steak was better without the sauce the put on it. next time i'll ask them to leave it off.   service was excellent, though we were there on a very slow night, so i cannot judge what it might be like on a saturday or during their popular brunch.   prices were high, but actually less than i expected for the quality. with drinks and tip we spent about $80 for the two of us. but it was a rare date for us, so i did not mind too much.   in all, it was a good experience.",1
"i'm a fan.   turf is what you get when you want an average irish bar crossed with a high end urban pub with leather-backed chairs. this is nothing more and nothing less and has been delivered downtown to much success.  i do like that they know me and my friends already after one week, and have handled complicated car key situations, mayor gordon sightings with grace and easiness. kudos them.",1
"their espresso is absolutely the best. every single barista that's made my latte has foamed the soy perfectly. small, thick, creamy bubbles. i used to slang coffee, and i know. small, thick, creamy soy bubbles. most places don't steam it correctly, but cartel? they're consistent and quite friendly.   usually they've got a pretty decent selection of tunes going, and i'm happy they're not afraid to play it loud.",1
"this one is a great neighborhood bar.  after moving away a few years ago, i don't feel nearly as at home here anymore (not to mention, it's the type of bar best walked to from the nearby neighborhood), but it's good to see that they still have the classic juke box and usually have plenty of open pool tables.  great place to relax over a beer.",1
went for dinner great happy hour menu had the carpacchio which i always try ...excellent  thin slice but not to thin to where you cant pick it off the plate and the pasta bolognese w veal tasty tasty as well service good atmosphere a bit stuffy but  thats my issue deffinetly worth a try,1
"if you are looking for pizza hut style pizza, this is not the place for you. this pizza will not be loaded with toppings, soaked by grease, or doughy.   instead, it is a lovely thin crust pizza, fired to perfection in the wood-burning oven. it is topped with a variety of toppings..shrooms, pepperoni, melon, caesar salad...you get the drift. the caesar pizza is delicious and perfect on a hot summer day. just filling enough, but not to the point where you'll need to roll out of there. also great is the artichoke and portobello mushroom pizza. the pizza is perfectly covered with juuuust enough cheese. the mushrooms and artichokes are perfectly placed.   i think the pizza sauce is key. hence the name i'm sure. :) not too salty or acidic, but full of tomato flavor. no chunks, and nothing to get stuck in your teeth.   definitely consider starting off with a salad, which is the perfect size for sharing.   salad to share, two sodas, and a pizza - 20 bucks.",1
"my family has been spending b-day's at nny for years, and i wish i could tell you why.  maybe we're just creatures of habit, because i have been consistently disappointed with their food.  i'm a wing girl, and last nights dry, crusty wings did nothing for me.  the pizza was mediocre...i would have done better to stuff a frozen pizza in my purse and take bites when the waitress wasn't looking.  and i know the economy is bad, but they were doing some real nickel and dimeing.  5 of us ordered 50 wings, and it only came with 4 small cups of ranch.  so, it was a fight to decide who had to share.  then someone had the brilliant idea to just ask for another cup of ranch.  the waitress warmly replied ""there is an extra charge for that"".  oh well,  i guess it's my fault if i keep going back.",0
"i have to be honest, i never look forward to getting waxed, but at least when i do, i can enjoy the lamar while i'm at it.  this place is great, it's exactly what a spa should be: clean, comfortable, and calming.    all the staff are super friendly and good at what they do...ellen in particular, i always leave happy and satisfied when i get a wax or facial from her.    they frequently run specials too, which is nice, you just have to get on their mailing list.  if you're in the scottsdale area, be sure to book an appointment here.",1
"the food at pita jungle is really good but the service at the 2 locations i have been at is always the same, horrible!  i came into this location to have dinner with 3 other people and walked in and asked for a table and the hostess sat 4 people who came in after me before me.  when she walked back she said, ""oh, i forgot that you needed a table for 4 as well.  something will clear up soon.""  then our waitress was a little less than thrilled to be helping us.  the food took forever to get to our table and we were never asked if we wanted more drinks, we had to ask another waiter for help.  i am all for supporting local establishments but pita jungle is hard to support when they seem so uninterested in their customers.",0
"between 3 and 4 stars, depending on when you go...  previous reviews are dead-on for weekend nights, this place fills up with douchebags - that's why we're usually long gone by then, before the college crowd and the bathroom attendants show up, and the prices go up.  me and my work buddies have been known to head over fridays after work for a few hours. this is the time to go. tables are cheap, and there are plenty to choose from. service is fast, and the drinks are cheap and strong.",1

"one of my favorite breakfast places in scottsdale. they have a ""best things in life card"" that they punch so every 5th breakfast is free. they have double punch days for holiday weekends too. the omelets are awesome, the pancakes are super yummy and their portions are always big. if you leave hungry its your own fault! they also give you to go cups of whatever drink you order to take with you at the end of the meal. they are always super friendly here and the atmosphere is good for kids. this location has a nice patio and offers complimentary coffee while you wait to be seated. all around a wonderful breakfast joint. they have 15 different locations around the valley so you are bound to have one close to you.",1
"i always passed by this place and never thought it will interest me until my sister wanted to come here. i like how all the decor is forest like. :)   came in, and got seated right away!   i got the thick french toast. not my favorite choice. bummed.  we spilt our meals. :)  sissy had the california benedict. it was absolutely amazing. i think this was the first time ever that my biscuit was crispy!!!!! it was perfect. andddd the hash browns? whooo, don't get me started on that. the potatoe was cut thick, not thin and all mashed up like other places.  it was well cooked, crisp and was delightful.  best hash browns everrr!!!! especially with the black bear diner original pepper sauce baby burn with ketchup was yummmyyyy.   i am one happy girl. i would be happier if my french toast was good. booo.. so.... four stars.  all this deliciousness was all under 20 bucks!!!!!",1
"swaddee, what happened?! i used to love you. i guess now that i've been exposed to really wonderful, flavorful thai, your restaurant just isn't as appealing to me as it was 10 years ago.  my husband and i dined at the chandler location recently since it's near his work. he got the house salad which was just a standard salad with bland peanut dressing. what upset him is that the ""shrimp"" listed in the description was just that-- one shrimp, singular.  i got the spicy eggplant figuring that would be a good choice since eggplant is in season. it was just ok. i tasted more grease than anything else, but i was missing all those hot/sour/sweet/bitter elements that i expect with thai food.  luckily there are other thai places in the area. it's time to move on.",0
"soooo i was craving a good burger and had heard good things about the grind so i decided to check it out.  what i got was a very good burger but very poor service and a pricey bill.  i got there just in time for happy hour and ordered a kiltlifter on the hh menu.  the bartender was nice and offered to ring in two for me so i could get the deal since ""they are only $2"" but i had to function later so i declined.  i told the bartender i was going to order food as well and he slides me a menu.  aaaand then proceeded to forget about me for 20 minutes.  granted i had my beer but my main purpose for going there was because i was starving.  a gentleman sat next to me and experienced the same thing, it took him 15 minutes to get a beer and the bar was not busy at all.  the main bartender was too busy chatting with his one regular about the nfl draft or air humping to pay attention to his guests.  yes i said air humping.  i think you get what i am saying.  he even forgot to finish making a drink for his regular half way through because he stopped to get a drink of root beer.  someone forgot to take their add meds today.  finally one of the other employees came over and took the order of 4 other bar patrons and alerted the 2 bartenders that she had to do their work.  the main bartender pitched a bitch fit to his other bartender about how it wasn't his fault and gossip gossip gossip but dude, it was your fault.  after waiting to be recognized again, i finally ordered my burger and it was amazing.  hands down one of the best burgers in town.  my gripe?  it ended up being a $12 with no side.  no fries, no salad, not even a pickle.  i also only got 2 cheese choices, cheddar and swiss.  come on what is this mcdonalds?  so i drank my beer, wolfed down my burger and tried to ignore the antics of one annoying bartender.  grand total for beer and burger was $15.75 (beer was actually $3.50 not $2).  was the burger amazing?  yes!  did feel like i got my moneys worth?  no.  did i want to punch that annoying bartender in the face? yes!  i would expect this kind of service in scottsdale but this is arcadia folks, step it up.",0
"went  this morning for breakfast the woman who was there looked at us like.....how did you get in here, not the most friendly reception (she did not speak english so when i tried to order a side i got the blank stare) after giving us the death stare she turned and walked away usually i would tend to walk out but i have had this place on my list to try for awhile.after we took a seat she brought us menus there are only 5/6 breakfast to choose from i had the scramble w/blk beans and plantains the plantains were o.k. but i have had much better much to greesy, wife had shredded beef w/scrammble she said it was good i thought the beef was dry, all and all it was a decent breakfast but not inexpensive for what you get. will not go back for breakfast but will defenetly go try lunch or dinner",0
tried eggplants pizza.. yes you read it correctly.. eggplants pizza.. the taste is phenonemal! the eggplants and cheese are just melt in your mouth. i am totally in love with this! sure will get some more of this next time!,1
"can't help but like this place. the food is about a 3.5. i think the beer selection needs to broaden! bring in some locals like santan, or some co beers like odell's or lefthand. the typical beer selection is getting old even though i am sure they make a killing off what they have always served. i guess thats what makes this place good. but i personally want to see more beer!!  i use to frequent this place at night but only during the day and hh to avoid the hipster crowd who think they and this place is the shit! sorry, yeah...i forgot my fixed gear bike at home and my chucks too! deal with it! oh wait, i don't own any of those things cause i am not a hipster nerd! no tats either!! so i go when the crowd is semi-normal for tempe...haha! yeah right! anyway, love the oysters and the typical mesh of east coast and west coast seafood treats. can't eat here much but it is fun when we do. keep up the good work, maybe the hipsters can find somewhere else to hang out? too bad coffee cartel is not a bar too, then they can just stay there! oh well. cool place, been going here for years.",1
"(lyric - janet jackson - love will never do (without you)) phoenix palace i have tried before to replace as my dim sum place never did i have a doubt it's dim sum i can't do without  they said it wouldn't last we had to prove them wrong cause i've eaten in the past that hunger will always be without you  phoenix palace i have tried before to replace as my dim sum place never did i have a doubt it's dim sum i can't do without i feel better after a meal with you cause no other place around has quite the same yum yum (ha ha ha!) like you do do do do...  phoenix palace is an old school dim sum joint located in the heart of what i call little chinatown.  off dobson and warner this little corner in chandler is a mecca for asian businesses, aside from your la fitness on the northwest corner.  phoenix palace is in the same corner as lee lee's market; where you can explore all food ingredients from the orient.    i'm a dim sum lover and i wish i could go every weekend, but that would totally destroy my diet!  needless to say, phoenix palace is one of my favorite dim sum places in phoenix.  they offer up some traditional products like siu mai, nai wong bao, phung chows, and cha sui baos.  moreover, they also have some newer products and i gather it's for the more american guest like fried noodles, fried rice and calamari.  all good, but some times i wish they would just stick with tradition.    overall, the dim sum is pretty good and one of the best in my opinion of what we can get in phoenix.  it'll get the job done as they say, but don't expect it to blow your mind away.  service here has improved through the years and afterwards you can always stop by lee lee's to get your asian groceries.  just a skip and a hop away is a boba place so you might as well get your entire asian fix on and done! - enjoy",1
"right off the bat (no puns intended,) i had the feeling we were at the giants ballpark in sf. no parking. there are some random streets around the area that have parking for free, though you have to be careful and read the signs. there are hour restrictions on the length of time you can park there. there are also pay lots nearer the park, usually anywhere from $5 - $20, though we did not see any in the upper values. we found a sneaky spot, the dirt lot across the street from the us egg is free. yes, you have to walk a few blocks, but its free. no biggie. it was a nice day, not too hot, and we could always use a walk. i may have just leaked the best secret, but just leave us a spot when we are in town...  i had a negative bias about this place going in. we went to see an a's vs giants game. being an a's fan (guilty by association with sg), i was not supposed to love the park. it is the giants park. but, of course i was going to come in with an open mind. an open mind and no outside food. except bottled water. but only 1 bottled water per person. god forbid we have more than one per person. yes, strike one.   we entered and headed toward our bleacher seats along the left field line. our seats were only a few rows up from the field, so there was promise that we might get a ball during the game. i had my glove and was optimistic. randy johnson was pitching for the giants, so likely to be some fouled off balls if they can make contact.  on our way to our seats, we took a peek at the food vendors. there was a decent assortment of independent food vendors with some unique foods.  we really did not try anything, having just eaten before the game, but the options were there.   the first thing we noticed about the bleacher seating was that the seats are square to the field. ok, that's great, as long as you do not want to watch what is going on with the pitcher and batter. you are, at least out where we were sitting, looking square on to the outfielder. usually the ballparks angle the seats to aim them more toward the infield, but these clearly were not. this caused much neck ache.   with the growing neck aches, we decided to walk the park. we checked out the views from the outfield grass and walked the whole park. the grass is actually nice and would be a fun place to hang out with a group and just lounge on a blanket. byo blanket (yes you can bring that as long as it is not edible). get there early, it does pack up pretty quickly. expect lots of twenty somethings out there drinking and hanging out. they are pretty well behaved and seem to have a good time out there.   overall, i do not think we will go here again. just no reason. we can see the a's at home and be more comfortable and have less hassle getting here, parking, getting less neck aches, and being in our home park.",0
"2 stars for the stupid kids who work here. i'm pretty desperate for boba when i'm in arizona since i don't have the luxury of having a boba place in every freakin corner like i do back home....... so i might will be back, but i'll make sure to make my order crystal clear to the kids who work here.  so i went in a couple weeks ago, and this girl working the register is totally staring into space as i'm ordering. now it's like a million degrees outside so i'm definitely craving something cool and refreshing, nothing milky. i tell this girl... ""i want two jasmine green teas"". i made sure to make myself clear.... i did not say jasmine milk tea, i said jasmine green tea since this has happened to me at this location before.  when my drinks are done, the teenage boy yells ""2 jasmine milk teas"". omg. did i not make myself clear??? so i explain to this boy, i wanted jasmine green teas, i didn't order a milk tea. and he gives me the craziest look and says "" sooooooo you just want green tea?"" so i repeated myself and he says "" soooooo you don't want milk?"" yes child, that's what i said! do you not make that here? omg i never had an issue ordering a jasmine green tea back home with workers who could barely speak english!!! i was so annoyed.  i took my teas since i had already created so much confusion behind the counter. ugh, i must find another boba place in this state!",0
"they are open for less than nine hours a day, service can be slow, lacks a vibe, but their macarons are to die for!  it's close enough for me to satiate my cravings for their macarons within minutes, but, the macarons are worth driving down from anywhere in the valley. i like the fact that they make them in small batches. while they may run out of some flavors, you know you are buying a fresh one, each time.  try their bread pudding while you are there and take some chocolate eclairs to go.   lunch is okay, but, their breakfast is simple, fresh and tasty. orange juice is freshly squeezed (something i am finicky about) and side of mushrooms are sauteed to perfection.",1
"i found this place on yelp when i was looking for a dinner spot close to tempe marketplace to catch a movie later in the evening. per the other reviews, i thought it might be busy on a friday night so i called two days in advance to make dinner reservations for 4 at 7:30.   our party of four arrived at 7:28pm and checked in with the hostess. i was initially relieved that i made the reservations because the place was packed! the hostess said they would come find us when our table was ready so we took a spot standing near the cute merchandise they have for sale and expected maybe a 10-15 minute wait. luckily our conversation entertained us because before we knew it, 20 minutes had gone by and we were still waiting. we waited another 10 minutes before checking on our table since they were busy but when we did, we were informed that our table would be ready shortly since 5 tables were nearly done. fine. as we continued to wait, we were approached by a very intoxicated woman and had to endure a very awkward conversation with her. clearly not the restaurant's fault but maybe someone should have cut this lady off before we had to hear about how her father made french toast?! we finally finished our 50 minute wait and were taken to the bar side of the restaurant where we were placed one table away from the entertainment that evening. it was a middle-aged piano player who talked more than sang and was having a full on conversation with the table next to us. had we not been waiting for 50 minutes already and didn't have a movie to make in an hour and 15 minutes, i would have demanded a different table.  at this point, i was hoping the service and food were going to make up for this rocky start. unfortunately, it didn't get much better.   our waitress showed up after a several minute wait and took our drink order. she was clearly busy but definitely not overly friendly or accommodating. i cautioned my dinner guests that we would need to order asap if we ever wanted a chance to make our 9:30 movie and we all picked out our dishes and ordered the next time she came back to our table. once we ordered and our drinks arrived, we were served garlic bread and i must admit, that was some of the worst garlic bread i've ever had. there was absolutely nothing special about it and it was like someone took out the fluffy, good part of the bread and seasoned the crust. blah.   by the time our food arrived close to 30 minutes later, it was clear we had no chance of making our movie. the food was okay but i don't think even the best italian food at this point would make me want to come back here. the piano guy finally took a break and we were able to have a nice conversation without yelling over him and just decided to enjoy our dinner guests rather than rushing. we didn't end up leaving until most of the place was cleared out (about 10pm) and don't recall ever being offer additional drinks while we chatted.  i do know my water glass was full all the time. at least they got that right. on the way out, we were thanked by 4 different people sitting at the bar as we left. really? where has the great service been all night? apparently sitting at the bar. we will never be back.",0
"may 07 update:  just saw black rebel motorcycle club here. maybe it's the venue or just the f'n amazing bands i've seen at the joint. either case, i'll be back.   be prepared to stand for quite some time. get there early to avoid a parking snafu. come ready to be frisked. if you're 21+, there's good ol' refreshments to be had. bathrooms are relatively clean, considering.   the acoustics are a bit questionable, though. big disappointment.  i saw the black keys here in sept 2006. it was the best show i saw all year. incredible akron oh guys just jamming to the brink of exhaustion. i applaud them... and i tip my proverbial hat to marquee for bringing them to town.",1
"well, damn.  until tonight, all of our experiences at red robin had been positive. even at this location, our past meals had been enjoyable.  tonight, though...tonight left a sour taste in my mouth. that's not to say that the food was bad...it was actually pretty good. but the service was atrocious.  we thought it was our lucky day when we walked right in on a saturday night and sat right down at 7:00. we ordered our appetizer and drinks. the waiter, cameron, came back and took our order a few moments later.  our appetizer came out in record time! we had hardly taken a few bites of our hummus plate, and then our food came out! like i said...the food was good.  so, where was the horrible service? the food was there fast, hot, and it was good. what could have bothered me so much?  well, i don't think the waiter said more than a dozen words to us. it seemed like he was late for something very important, and we were his last obstacle to overcome before he was able to free himself from the self-imposed bonds of servitude to red robin.  customarily, the waiter comes around after the food arrives and asks how things tasted. this guy didn't show up until our food was gone, our drinks were gone, and we were ready for the check and couple of to-go boxes.  he begrudgingly gave me a refill on my drink before he dropped off the check. now, granted, we don't ever get desert in a restaurant...but this guy didn't even give us the satisfaction of turning down his delicious sounding proposal.  the whole process felt like we were imposing on this kid. we were in and out of the restaurant in less than 30 minutes.  this guy robbed us of the entire restaurant experience.  if you can't enjoy the experience, then why go?  it will definitely be a while (if ever) before i visit this location again. but i can promise that i'll avoid this kid like the plague if he's still ""working against his will"" at this location.",0
"i always have great service here. their happy hour is banging, and the employees are nice to look at. i've never had a bad experience here.  the bathrooms are a little creepy though. you have to go through a separate door in the back, but besides that everything here is delicious and filling.  also, if you check in on foursquare, they will give you free edamame or miso soup. so don't forget to show it to your waiter!",1
"i went to @coachnwillies last night, as part of the @downtownphoenix spring fling pub crawl. coach & willies is the reason negative ratings should be possible on @yelp.  i will never, ever return.  when we arrived, we ordered a beer, and a soda.  we also ordered nachos. they were piled high. this is a good thing.  removing the first couple chips resulted in a couple olives falling on to the bar. i wiped them into a pile, but figured i'd wait until i was done, to catch anything else, and clean it up.  a few of us decided to have a shot, to celebrate a birthday-in-progress. i flagged one of the bartenders down.  he approaches me and says ""are you gonna stop making a mess on my bar?"" me: ""excuse me?"" bt: ""you're making a mess"" me: ""i would like to order a drink, not get hassled"" bt: ""i don't care about your drinks, i only care about your tips"" me: ""well you're not exactly working for one at the moment"" bt: ""are you going to order or not?""  i placed my order without any further comments, lest i inform him of my true feelings.  he takes my credit card and asks if i'd like to keep it open. i tell him no, because i have left my card in the past.  he returns with the receipt. on the ""tip"" line i write ""nofuckingway!"" i work in a service industry. you don't treat me like shit and still get a tip. fuck you.  a while later i go to order a beer. this same motherfucker tells me i'm cut off.  yes, i am cut off.  i have had maybe three beers, and a shot, in 5 hours.  i ask another bartender, and as he is about to pour me a beer, the first sob hollers to him that i am cut off, then proceeds to show him my receipt.  because, apparently, you not giving a tip is justification for him being a cocksucker.  i demand to see a manager, and one comes over. i tell him that the guy is cutting me off because i refused to tip him, and he tells me that the problem is that there is a $10 minimum on cc transactions.  curiously, that isn't stated anywhere. further, this ""manager"" took my first beer order, when i arrived, and made no mention of the minimum when i bought just the one beer, nor did the other bartender mention that when i paid for the shots, which actually totaled $24.  this ""manager"" was gracious enough to let me pay their establishment for service again. /sarcasm  i will recommend to every single person i know to never patronize that establishment, and i will never return to a place with such puerile and petty employees.",0
"met some friends here after work.  while mabel's is more of a late night place, we still had fun.  the swedish meatballs, lollipop chicken and pork belly appetizers were all good.  the old fashioned cocktail is a winner.  i love the dark, cluby atmosphere and cool music.",1
"ok, i'm reviewing another chain.  but with two kids in tow who argue over almost everything, this was the easiest choice.  i sat in the back, by the restrooms because they need to go 6 times every meal.  our server, billy, was attentive and totally on task, thank you!!!  the kids meals are good and affordable and the field green salad and asparagus soup were great.",1
"we went to ra last night, having been there before we knew what to expect, but this time, it was a lot worse. the service was terrible, and it wasn't that busy. the happy hour, have good prices on it, but all of the appetizers are deep fried, and there aren't too many choices for sushi.",0
"i love big buddha. by far the best chinese food in surprise. now the previous statement is not saying much, but we do what we can in the boonies right? i would recommend the beef chow fun, the chicken egg foo young and the kung pow chicken. if you go during lunch you can't beat the price. if i remember right it's like $6 for an entree, soup, and a crab puff. unlike any of the other chinese food joints in surprise, it's actually worth a visit.",1

"we have wanted to try this place for quite sometime but its usually so busy that we dont dare try to find a parking space.  today didnt look so bad unfortunately :-)  wish we had tried the daily dose instead.  oh well theres always next time.  these reviews are hilarious.  made the mistake of not reading them before hand.  the service sucked.  the waitress sucked.  she really pissed me off.  my husband had to keep reminding me the girl was young and what if that was your daughter cuz i wanted to punch her in the face.  it took forever just to be acknowledged, waited a lifetime for some water.  asked her what was good on menu this is our first visit.  too bad we took her advice.  my husband got the bird omelet which i tasted and yuck.  it was completely bland.  he had to pour hot sauce all over it for flavor.  they put the eggs right on top of the fresh cold fruit so that now you cant eat it or wouldnt want to eat it.  if they just read their own reviews they would stop doing that.  talk about dumb asses.  i got the huevos rancheros with green chili.  it comes in an open chipotle tortilla that is minus any taste.  its swimming in juices which is making the tasteless tortilla into glue.  comes with two eggs on top.  the flavors together were just not that good.  got a $4 glass of fresh squeezed orange juice that made my face scrunch up because of the bitterness.  waitress brought bill way too early obviously trying to get rid of us but that just pisses me off even further cuz thats her ticket to not having to do shit.  i waived that bitch down anyway.  i want water bitch.  the only reason they get 2 whole stars is because the green chili was good otherwise hate this place :-)",0
"i've been back a few times since the last review but the most notable was to see dj z-trip. he was awesome, no complaints there.  bar smith though? they failed on so many levels.   i got there sometime between 10:30 and 11:00 and there was about a 20 minute wait out front. not the end of the world or anything but after finally getting in, there was a sea of bodies and another very long wait. about 50 people were lined up by the stair case waiting to get upstairs. there was a bouncer not allowing anyone up there until people would slowly trickle out. why they put z-trip on the patio, i don't know. it's the size of a shoe box and was clearly to capacity before 11 pm. fail fail fail fail fail!!   i was in various lines roughly 50 minutes and still hadn't made it upstairs. forget about stepping out of line to get a drink because you'd lose your place. the short of it is i paid for pre sale tickets, managed to get there at a decent time, and still had to wait close to an hour just to get in the same room as the guy. it was a total let down.   at that point i was so ready to just walk out and ask for my money back. they clearly oversold the event and didn't give much thought about their patrons who paid money to see this dj. they were going to fit every last body into that place if it killed them...and everyone else in there.   after finally getting upstairs there were so many bodies, no one could move at all. it was a total clusterfuck. i finally made it to the back bar and stood in line for 10 minutes just to find out their card reader broke earlier in the night. fantastic. no signs saying it was a cash bar, that would have been a nice gesture.   also, the bathrooms were downstairs, so forget about having to pee at all during the 2+ hours you're there. if you had to go, you better hold it, otherwise you'd be waiting in line for another 30 minutes just to get back up.   by the time z-trip came on, the sound was bass heavy and mildly distorted. i inched my way to various parts of the patio but the sound didn't get any better, so my partner and i said fuck it and went downstairs for the rest of the night. thankfully they were playing his set downstairs and upstairs. at least people could move more easily downstairs. plus the sound was better. and the bathrooms were actually accessible.   even at the end of the night, there were people standing in line waiting to get upstairs. bar smith gets a huge ""f"" as far as i'm concerned. i won't be back to this place for any headlining dj. they obviously don't know how to run an event.",0
"i was disappointed with this grocery store.  i had heard so many wonderful things about it from friends that my expectations were quite high.  we tried many of the fresh and easy label and only liked the meatballs.  their pickles taste so weird the jar is still full in my fridge.  their olive bread had no flavor.  their canned tuna was also super boring.  the apple fritters were dry and old. the cole slaw was terrible.  they have a very poor selection of produce. there wasn't enough heads of romaine for 3 days of juice.  we couldn't find kale or celery.  the manager that checked us out gave us $15 worth of coupons off our grocery bill, so that was nice of him.  he raved about how good the fresh and easy brand was and even tried to convince us to trade in some of our items for the fresh and easy brand.  i'm glad we didn't or we would have been even more disappointed.  he also said they are known for their low prices, the lowest in the valley so they don't accept coupons that aren't from fresh and easy... but that's not true.  safeway has much better prices on their produce (and a much better selection).  i'll stick with safeway, aj's and whole foods.",0
"i decided to give pomo another shot. i ended up at the same high table that overlooks the kitchen. for whatever reason, this spot seems to be unpopular but i like it because it keeps me warm and i can see what's going on with my food!  my friend and i shared the mista salad and the pomo pizza. i was much more pleased this time with the food we ordered! the sausage on the pomo pizza was delicious and the mista salad was larger and more filling than we expected. it's also fun to get all of the little freebies. they brought out bread and oil, the fried strips of dough with powdered sugar (again), limoncello (again), and then this sweet cake. it felt like the longer we sat there, the more food they put in front of us! service is very attentive and i never felt that we had to wait long for anything. also, i'm assuming the man who gives out the limoncello shots is the owner and it's fun to see him around.   the pizza is still not my favorite in the valley (hence the 4 stars) but i can definitely say that it's a solid place to go and it's a nice option in the pizza rotation.",1
"i completed the ""blazin' challenge"" and whooo buddy was i burnin'. it was fun though. the only con: they make you pay for the challenge, like $20 for the wings, they didn't have our shirts, and your name only stays on the board for a short while. everything else was good though - wings are great & they have lots of flavors to choose from.",1
definitely better than subway thinking of their meat makes me sick. anyhoo i always get the philly with chipotle mayo and it is deeelish!  jersey mike's is little expensive and that's why i don't come here a lot but you get what you pay for i can't think of another place where you can get a better sub.,1
"i went to my monthly philosophical gathering last friday...we examine, ponder and discuss some of the more esoteric aspects of life!  i had so much fun!  it's 2-3 hours of defining, questioning, cussing, discussing, opining, agreeing, disagreeing...well, you get the drift...last week's topic was ""what is art?""  i did not know that people felt as passionately about art and artistic expression as they do...and that includes me:)  normally, i would try to have a couple of pops before a discussion like this (that's to honor socrates, aristotle, plato and their students...their sessions were often drunken debauches and the last man standing was the ""winner"" in the philosophical debate of the evening...good times:)  but i didn't ...i was stone cold sober for this discussion...i might have even made sense!   after we finished our discussion, several of us decided that a cocktail was a very good idea and headed to the vig...i know, you thought it was hip nightspot, but it's really renowned throughout the valley of the sun as a philosopher's hangout.  nice place...all concretey from the outside, all wood and fabric and leathery inside...pretty...even ""artistic"":)  when we got to the vig, the scholarly discussions were occurring at full volume all around us:)  * ""gimme a cig"" * ""dude!!!!"" * ""don't look...it's cindy and darrel"" * ""hey baby...wanna go see my (car, house, dog, condo, wiener, etc.)""  and much, much more...accompanied by enormous clouds of cigarette smoke (another aid to a good philosophical discussion).  we sat and chatted and had a couple of pops...and i would have said that the vig was a-ok...except for one minor philosophical disagreement...you, mr. waitperson, don't get to unilaterally upgrade my order to something far more expensive!  i had no idea who was going to be buying (although it turned out to be me) and i ordered j&b with a cube and a splash (i didn't want to put the hurt on my philosophically minded buddies by ordering the expensive stuff:)...but when the waiter brought my drink, i knew instantly that this wasn't j&b...it was macallan 12!  and while i do love it so, it was almost 3 times as expensive as the j&b...i asked the waiter why he didn't bring what i ordered and he said...and i quote...""quote""...""the bartender is a scotch guy and said this is better""...end quote.  no sh*t!  i quietly said ""i didn't order the macallan...are you saying this is going to be the same price as the j&b?  oh no...it wasn't:(  but as my waitperson said...""it's already poured...what do you want me to do about it?""  i could have made a scene, caused a problem, left a $0.10 tip...but i didn't...this was philosophy night...i was in a philosophical mood!  and my philosophy is this...i have a giant problem with any establishment that pulls this kind of crap...it may only be an isolated incident, but it could also be systemic....how many drunks check their tabs?  i know, you're saying ""well, donald, it's only the difference between $5.50 and $14.00 for that drink"", and you would be right...i spill more than that most days:)  but i get to decide what i spill it on...not the bartender and waitperson at the vig.   at best it's corrupt and at worst, it's, well...worse than corrupt.",0
"pam - you are - sexy, sleek, sophisticated and still a work in progress - your collections are young and show in the smallness of them and in the lopsidedness of the collection itself...however, you are good time! and really that is all that matters. the collections are interesting, the docents are knowledgeable and have a way of engaging patrons so you feel asking any question under the sun...no matter how art ignorant it may sound. it was a great way to spend a few hours of the day and i walked away feeling enthused about art and yearning to go back. enjoy!",1
"i love everything about this yoga studio. it may be in a strip mall, but you'd never guess once you're inside. there's also the option of taking your classes at the phoenician, which is always beautiful. i got a 10-class pass from groupon and have only used the first so far, but i can't wait to return next week--and every week after that!   overall, if you're looking for an honest yoga studio with great instructors and many class options, this is the place for you.",1

"a friend of mine stayed here while visiting scottsdale, and i was very impressed! the resort is very hidden and quaint, but it was so nice! i liked how it has a small charm feel and yet it was also was very luxurious! we hung out at the hotel a lot one day and just hung out in the beautiful room and grounds. my friend also had breakfast in the dining room every morning and he said it was excellent.   if you have friends or family coming to visit i would recommend the scottsdale resort. it's beautiful and doesn't have the vast cold feeling of most hotels. it's also located in a great part of central scottsdale!   i believe he found some deals on hotwire or priceline as well.",1

so last night i experienced the armadillo for the first time.  i honestly wasn't impressed from the amount of good and great reviews i've seen.   as a sports bar they have plenty of tv's and the game audio on which is nice.  there is not much good seating around the restaurant so eat at the bar if you can.    the food was just ok.  i had the louisiana shrimp.  i don't know how they can call them louisiana shrimp because everytime i've had bbq shrimp in new orleans they are good size shrimp.  these were tiny little shrimp drowned in sauce.  the sauce however was good and there is plenty of bread to scoop it up and eat it with.    they have several beer options which is nice and a full bar for mixed drinks and shots.    if you just are looking for a divish type bar to watch the game at with just decent food then this would be a good spot but there are many options of places like that i feel have way better food.   2.5/5,0
"the food here is good, upper end for a chain. the steak i had was done perfectly -and the pasta vodka with ricotta filled pockets was very nice.  now the reason for the low score...  the place was single large room packed with people. not great if you want a semi-relaxing meal... and when i'm spending a decent coin i don't want to be crammed into a massive room with a few hundred people and hear everyone's conversation from all over the place.  we had coupons so the price was fine but at regular price, for the same $, i'd go to several other places with better food and a better, relaxing and more quiet, atmosphere.",0
"went there yesterday for lunch. not at all impressed with the food.  portions were very small.  i am a small eater and ususally get filled up quickly.  but i left there yesterday still a bit hungry.  nice salad of lettuce and strips of poultry.  our menu said there were meatballs being served.  the meatballs consisted of just a couple bowls of them on a table which probably sat 15-18 people.  they were bite sized and most people got just 1 and some did not get any.  we were waiting for them to bring more out but instead they came back with the dessert.  a tiny, probably 1.5-2 inch square of red devil sponge cake.  no soft drinks, etc, only water was served.  i had been considering to go back some day for hh but at the size of servings i would probably have to order 5 of the hh menu. i had hoped that i would really like this place, but alas no.",0
"slow service. the banana blueberry bead was so so. rolls were so so.  sushi wasn't bad, not awesome. service was total poops.",0
"i'm kind of confused as to how i ended up spending $25 on 2 lattes, 1 wrap, and 1 brownie...  the price to satisfaction ratio on this place is not very good.  the lattes were okay, but i get much better value and flavor at lola's down the block.  their vegetarian wrap was covered in some kind of greasy dressing and loaded with olives (even though i requested no olives).  the brownie was huge, but very dry.   i'm also kind of confused as to why this place was packed on sunday at 3pm.  maybe there was some kind of meetup event?  maybe people really do love this place?? it took forever to place my order because the barista/order-taker/cashier had too many tasks and there was only one of her.",0
"looking at the reviews of this place, i was hoping for at least a decent experience.   what i got was frozen fish, terrible sushi construction, and a spicy tuna roll that i almost couldn't eat, but did anyways due to the inflated prices, and some awful service.   i'll get the easy one out of the way. if you're the server and you see a stack of 4 dirty plates with two people who are still attempting to get some water our of empty glasses, pick it up, fill our drinks. it's simple.   as for the dishes, we started with the softshell crab roll, which had too much rice and no flavor. we then got the dynamitex2 roll, which i had expected to be spicy. what we got was spicy tuna, topped with chili sauce. normally, this would be fine, but instead of prepping their spicy tuna the traditional way (with kewpie & sriracha) it had jalapeño folded into it. the result was flavorless and burning hot.   their spicy scallop was offensive, with a small amount of scallops mixed with crab meat and poorly shoved into a roll.  the tako salad was actually tako sashimi, which i won't complain about. the slices were cut perfectly and the sauce was wonderful. easily the standout of the meal.   and lastly, uni(sea urchin). i typically make my judgment on a sushi restaurant based on how they handle such a delicate meal. typically, a good sushi chef tries to layer the meat in a way that the entire roll can be consumed. this wasn't layered well, and they used a good piece to hide some not good pieces.  i won't be coming back. almost $40 for 5 items, i've had better elsewhere.",0
"been coming to c fu a couple times a year for years....  we have our traditional christmas dim sum every year..and for the last couple years it has been losing its once wonderful food and service qualities.  this xmas we were dissapointed enough that we wont be back!  80% of the food we were served was not even lukewarm.  we tried to request fresh hot items but we were only successful in a few items.  i even spoke with the owner...as we usually do, to say hello ....this time we told him of our concerns and dissapointed and he didnt seem too concerned.  we also notices several items have shrunken in size....  we have found a couple dim sum restaurants that have high reviews and that is what we will try next.  cold food is unacceptable and owners lack of concern is a concern....  i noticed the lack of customers...maybe that is why the food was cold....i realize it is dim sum and cant stay hot...however it has always been at least warm...and you used to always be able to request fresh hot items, without them using the microwave to warm the food up...  note to owner:..... with the economy the way it is you are really gonna have to step up and start serving a better quality that you could be proud of!",0
"what a cute place!! that is about the only positive thing about aunt chilada's, unfortunately.  the food is not even mediocre it sucks!!  started with the nearly inedible chips and the dressed-up-ketchup salsa all the way through dessert was downright misery!  and the service sucks too :(",0
so many great places right in this area.  this place is a disappointment compared to most of them.  no wonder they sometimes give away random stuff to nice customers (we got cotton candy).  at least the service was good.,0
"i've ate at caffe boa quite a few times and have always enjoyed it (in fact, yesterday's visit was premeditated) but lunch was an experience like no other. my friend and i stopped there for lunch yesterday while we were strolling down mill doing a little shopping.   we both started with a cocktail as we always do. she had the anastasia (which she has enjoyed there before) and i ordered the dark mandarina. the drinks took forever to come out. at one point we thought our lunches would come out first and i hate it when that happens. at the bottom of both of our glasses were piles of undissolved sugar and my drink, while it tasted ok, but the most unappetizing color. and to add insult to injury, my drink was supposed to be flaming. the waitress tells me my drink was flamed earlier at the bar, ""so don't worry"". what? where are my flames? i want my show! you mean it had already peaked?   for lunch we each ordered their lunch combos. i ordered the buttercup lettuce salad and the butternut squash ravioli and my friend ordered the buttercup lettuce salad and the mixed italian meats panini. now, i'm not a very big eater (you wouldn't believe it looking at me, but it's generally true) but even i thought i didn't have enough lunch on my plate. on my plate was a half order of salad and three ravioli. count 'em folks. three! and they weren't large ravioli, they were three normal sized ravioli and to top it off, my toddler snatched one off my plate right when they set it down on the table so i was immediately down to two. they tasted good, as did the brown butter and toasted hazelnuts but i couldn't get over that i only got three. three! my friend said her sandwich was average but even though she had the same salad as i did and mine was on the bland side, hers was overly salty. we've ordered this salad before and the lemon vinaigrette has always been plate-licking good.   what's going on here? where's the old bartender? where's the salad dressing maker? where's the ravioli counter? i miss them all and want them back! oh, i feel all the old abandonment issues bubbling up to the surface again.",0
"i am happy to update my very poor review of cibo from several months ago and get on the fan bandwagon with all of my fellow yelpers. i also want to thank the proprietors who took my previous review seriously and encouraged me to give them another opportunity. i wish it hadn't taken me so long to get back to cibo (life tends to get in the way!!) and believe me, it won't be long before my next visit.  we returned for lunch today and were seated right away. the place wasn't near as busy as the last visit because many had columbus day off work. our server welcomed us promptly and took our drink orders. we decided on hot sandwiches: sicilian sausage and pulled pork. omg - they were soooo delicious!!! the pork was lean, tender and in a wonderful spicy (but not overly) sauce. the fontina cheese was a great touch and tasteful. the bread...ummmmm good. i'm tired of getting sandwiches on so much bread that you can't open your mouth wide enough to bite - the grilled saltimbocca bread was so good! the sausage sandwich was super flavorful with the perfect amount of peppers and onions. again, the bread complimented the sandwich.  the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it took a while to get our bill. while we weren't in a hurry, the server walked by our table a couple of times and didn't check in on us. as i mentioned the place wasn't overly busy at all so i would have expected a tad more attentiveness. but overall, the food was outstanding and the quaintness of the little house made for nice ambience.   i'm not a fan of eating crow, but if i have to, i will. i bet the chef at cibo could even make crow taste phenomenal!",1
"oh aracadia farms how i love the.  this update will be named tart lunch, as one of my favorite friends visited we sat for two hours and enjoyed every moment.  af had a special on girly drinks, so we each had a $5 raspberry champagne. shared the brie appetizer which was my favorite so far, and then shared the goat cheese tart and a key lime tart.",1

"this review started as one about chompie's at the pv mall. we will never again go to this chompie's.  see below:  ""we have been going to the chompie's on shea for over two years and really enjoyed the hometown ny food and atmosphere. it reminded us of all the good things that you would find at katz's in lower manhattan.   ""okay, so why the setup for another chompie's location?  well the last few times at the shea location we sat and waited, and waited(15 mins or so) for our waiter to come by and ask us for our drink order. hey, when you're busy that's to be understood -- but our waiter was on break most of time and the place was half empty.  also, it seems whenever we asked for anything (pickles, napkins, etc) our waiter seemed fairly indifferent to us.  it happened a few more times on different visits and so we had enough.   ""well, our trek in the desert has been rewarded. this chompie's (pv mall) is everything the other one wasn't.  the wait staff came by immediately and ask about our drinks order & offered suggestions on different menu items. we were thrilled. we didn't realize there was another chompie's nearby.  and the food was great (just like the one on shea)!  ""from now on we will shlep the extra 10 minutes to the pv mall location and will try to forget all about the other one over on shea.  if you're into katz's and some catskill theater then you might enjoy the chompie's on shea, we didn't!""  when the wait staff stand around talking while you're hungry, it's a real mood kill.  so go to chompie's at the pv mall and enjoy the food and service and feel free tip generously.  oh, btw there's a ton of parking available at pv another difference in their favor.  enjoy!",0
"ok i know i am going to get flack for this but here goes. are you freaking kidding me, no tarter?!?   on the advise of abu whose taste buds have now come into question, i tried pete's yesterday. i trekked out in what felt like 500 degree heat to the atm. because pete has not stepped into the 21st century yet!   the whole time i am thinking if they are still in business after no tarter and no debit it must be good, right? wrong. i have been tricked, hoodwinked, bamboozled, led a stray, run a muck. just flat out deceived!   i ordered the deluxe seafood combo 2 pieces of fish, 7 shrimp, fries and a 32 oz drink. which by the way did not have its price listed. i figured it couldn't be to much the regular combo has 1 less piece of fish and 3 less shrimp was only 5.95. wrong again $9.45! again thinking this fish must be outstanding!   i get it home and it was still piping hot and smelled wonderful! again with the trickery. i started with a french fry and it wasn't completely done in the middle yuck! i then moved onto what pete describes as shrimp, really there was shrimp in there? i never tasted it and only saw some small specks of white and red inside the gross grease laden dough! ugh i had to spit it out. even my dog left it and she has been known to eat her own poop!   the only reason pete's did not rate a 1 star from me is the square fish. yes i said square, it is a square patty just like mcdonald's only it does taste better than mickey d's. i didn't care for the red sauce on my fish. the 1st piece i ate plain and the second piece i added my own tarter sauce and it was delicious. on a sidebar some of the other fries were edible and pretty tasty.   i have yet to find a joint that can top the catfish at honey bears but not for lack of trying.   moral of this story, only get the fish and chips, make sure your chips are cooked and have tarter on the ready!  also lain gave me this tid bit of info... ""pete the owner was murdered as he slept, they used a hammer and bashed his head in, just some trivia for you...""  yeah they bashed his head in over that shrimp and no tarter sauce!",0
"dick's hideaway is one of my favorite restaurants in the phoenix area. i went there for breakfast and wasn't disappointed. they suggested the meatloaf(that's right for breakfast) and i must say it was good. it was hard getting over the concept of meatloaf for breakfast so i wouldn't order it again, but it was worth the experience. the coffee was good and fresh and the service was up to the task. the price however was a bit high for breakfast after tip and coffee it came to 20 dollars for one person. for lunch or dinner that's fine, but not for breakfast. granted there was enough food; that had i been joined by a comrade we could have easily split.",1
"the city of scottsdale does a great job keeping this park looking amazing all the time.  they have lots of fun things to do at this park. i personally like going on the train with my nephews and nieces.  it is so cute when their faces brighten up when we are on the train.  :)   the cool thing about the park is that they have two playgrounds. the first playground  is one of the biggest playgrounds around town.  it has a least 3 or 4 slides, a couple of swings, towers, ladders and monkey bars.  the other playground is in the middle of the park and has a western theme.  it has one slide, a pretend jail and a wagon that you can play on.  also they have a model train museum that you can get in for a couple dollars. it pretty fun to walk down all the aisles and see the old model trains.      looking for a fun park to go to when you come into town?  you should check out mccormick-stillman railroad park.  it is one of the best parks in town.",1

"i had visited the vig arcadia sometime last year and was underwhelmed at my experience but seeing a local dines for the vig uptown, i decided it would be worth trying it again at a different location.   we tried to call ahead and get on the list around 6:15pm on friday night. while they don't let you call ahead and put your name on the list, the hostess said it would only be a 20-30 minute wait and she thought it could be faster so even though we were starving, we decided to head out.   we arrived about 30 minutes later and the valet parking was a bit confusing. we pulled up to the valet stand and no one was there. just beyond the stand there was a sign that said the lot was full so i got out and looked around for someone to help us. about that time, the valet came up while i was still standing next to the car. he instructed my fiance  to pull up the car another 20 feet to the front door and then took the car to be parked. not sure why he couldn't have taken it there and it seemed a little odd but i figured they were pretty busy.   we entered and no one was at the hostess stand initially. someone appeared a few minutes later but didn't seem to be in charge of the area and ignored me. finally, a friendly hostess appeared and put us down and said it would be 20-30 minutes. we stood in the corner since the 4 cube seats were taken. i thought about maybe sitting on the patio to wait until every person that come from outside reeked like smoke. i overheard her mention to someone else that it was the 'smokers patio'...so much for fresh air so you might keep that in mind if you're hoping to sit outside. after a 35 minute wait, we were finally taken to our table.  as we sat down in our booth and realized how loud it was, we decided to sit on the same side so we could hear each other. it was crowded but it still shouldn't have been as loud as it was. our waitress came after a few minutes and took our drink and appetizer order. we opted for the wings and the tater tots. someone arrived with the wings a few minutes later and we figured the tots would be out shortly. with the wings nearly gone, she finally came back to check on us and when we asked about the tot's, she said she hadn't heard our order and she would get them out fast. totally couldn't blame her though since it was so loud. i didn't try the wings but my fiance said they were 'okay'.   we ordered the carne asada to share for dinner, figuring the tots would fill us up. shortly after she left, the tots came out. while they were huge and i think you get 6 or 7, they weren't great. the first one i ate had no cheese in it and the dipping sauce didn't taste like much. the tots didn't have a whole lot of flavor either and i would have preferred frozen ore ida over these! i kept trying to salt them but nothing helped. i asked the person who brought the tots for a side of ranch and also a refill on my drink.  the ranch arrived a few minutes later and then the refill another 3-5 minutes after that.   we did finally receive our dinner too and while it was very tender and had good flavor, our whole experience so far had kind of trumped the dinner. our waitress disappeared forever and never came to check back on us to see how our dinner was. when she eventually did reappear, she apologized for the wait and i think she said 'sorry for the wait, i kept cutting myself and i had to take care of that first'...huh? i still am not 100% sure what she said but that's sure what it sounded like. she did bring the bill and thankfully our bill was only $7 after the local dines credit. it took another lengthy amount of time to get the check to sign but she did apologize...again...for taking so long.   when we left, we were at least thanked for coming in. when we walked out someone held the door open for us and thanked us too. then began another valet fiasco. our car was 3rd in line parked and just across from the valet stand. we walked up to the stand but nobody was there except a man, who i assumed was waiting for his car. then someone appeared, took out our keys and then said he would be back to help us and laid our keys on the stand. having our car 20 feet away and rather than have to wait around for him to help someone else and then pull out our car, we grabbed our keys and started walking over to our car. instead, we were scalded by another valet that he would move our car and informed us 'there is a line'. you mean the one guy now standing by the valet being helped? whatever. i get these urban places have crappy parking but this whole valet is such a joke. i know they have a system for how they get cars in and out of the parking lot but its chaotic and they were never friendly and we were just ready to go.  at this point, both the vig's have struck out in my opinion and i'll find other places to dine.   one star for the ambiance (because it's swanky inside and might be a cool patio but it would be so much more enjoyable without all the noise) and another for...the carne asada?",0
"i've been a loyal ikea fan for years so it pains me to write them a bad review.  i recently remodeled my new home and came to ikea for flooring and kitchen cabinets.  i went in to purchase the flooring first but apparently their flooring is being eliminated. they did have one pallet left of the flooring i wanted but i couldn't find it so i asked for help.  i was unimpressed by their searching methods.  looking in the same place that i already looked and confirming it's not there isn't helpful.  about the same time i went to purchase my cabinets, ikea comes out with a new commercial that's aimed at clueless people who want a new kitchen, so i went in to buy my cabinets with confidence and measurements in hand.  i walked to the kitchen department and waited for an employee to finish up on the computer. i told him i was there to buy cabinets and he asked me if i knew which ones i wanted, i said i didn't so he hands me a booklet and tells me to pick them out and he'll put the order in for me.  i said ""don't you guys do this for me"" and he said ""you have to pick out the cabinets.""  great.  i left and grabbed a glass of that lingadong juice from the restaurant and started figuring out measurements and hurting my head with thoughts of angles and door openings.  when i finished, i headed back to the department to give the guy my list and i saw a couple sitting at the computer with a different ikea employee and they were living the commercial!  my heart sank.  why were those jerks getting their entire kitchen designed on cool software and i had to pick mine out of some black and white catalog- 1950's style.  my money is just as green as theirs!  as the guy started entering my order and asking me questions about toe kicks and countertops, my blood started to boil and i let the guy have it for not giving me the same service as the other customers there.  his attitude quickly changed and he became helpful.  at first he had told me to grab the sink drains and cabinet handles on my way out but after our chat, he went and got them for me.  when i went to pay for my order they told me it had to be picked up the same day, not ideal but okay.  i called my contractor and he said he'd be there in a few hours.  i'm pretty sure i'm the first customer to ever buy cabinets but have someone else pick them up because they have no system in place for that.  i had to beg the guy at the counter to help me out but he wouldn't.  so i decide to return the next day when harry and i can go together.  we come back the next day, i hand the cashier my order to pay and she tells me that they are out of everything.   me: really? you're out of every single cabinet that's on my order?  ikea cashier: yes, really.  me: in one day you sold out of all these cabinets?that doesn't make sense, these cabinets are on 3 different displays upstairs. this sink has been sold here for years. how can you be out?  ikea cashier: i don't know, but we're out.  go talk to ""pick-up"" about ordering more.  me: pick up? really? okay   the pick up guy tells me to talk to ""returns"" and returns tells me that because the order was placed yesterday, it's coming up as not available. he fixes it and finally i'm able to purchase the kitchen but not before growing contempt for my favorite home store.  lastly, i get a call from my frustrated contractor because the directions are telling him to drill holes into the cabinet face but there are no marks where to make the holes. i tell him no way, ikea instructions are faultless.  after a 25 minute hold with ikea support, i find out that guy at the kitchen department was supposed to give me templates for the holes to be made in the cabinets.  thanks for failing me once again, careless dude.",0
"the basics: nice atmosphere and good food, but a bit overpriced. started out with the interesting cheese platter turns out that it is not $18 interesting. we then split a roquefort salad. quite tasty. we split two entrees - filet mignon and lamb shank. filet was cooked well and sides were very good. lamb shank was cooked well, but the sauce sucked. dessert consisted of two tarts - samoa and four berry. four berry was really good. samoa was okay, but not great.  all in all the bill was close to $150 without a drop of liquor.   for that kind of money we/you could have two meals elsewhere.",0
"i really like this place. however it does suck time like no other place.  somehow evertime you are there for over 2 hrs?  i usually try on 60 items to get 1 that fits well, and cry a half dozen times about being fat :(  then i cruise the little kids clothes because the mens clothes are to large for me and the womens are cut weird.  one of my boobs is like a 3rd the size of the other so its soo hard to find clothes that dont make me look like a cancer survivor.  anyway, good finds here. try the clothes on even if it says the size is smaller than you wear. a lot of times it says one size but is really another. my girlfriend bought 200.00 jeans for 20.00 a piece because it said they were a 24 when they were really a 27.   p.s. anyone know where to find some dress vests?  the womens ones are too short and make me look like i have flowing love handles and the mens vests are to big in the shoulders and ribs.  i think i should try maybe a kids vest? thoughts?",1
"jade chicken, jerk fried rice... need i say more? if you can get passed the ""complicated"" way of ordering, then you will fall in love with this place. i don't even want to ruin it for you, just go here and try it out.",1
"this is the first time i have ever been to this location.  i love the one located in phoenix, on mcdowell road.    this is a bit different however.   the decor does not have the 60's cool ,romantic feeling of the original location. but, it is really clean and well lit for sure.  the staff is friendly and do a good job with their product.  the food was excellent! the greek salad  was enough for 3 people and  that was the small version.  wine was very responsible, and consistent refills on the ice tea. the pizza was delicious and the wings were fabulous!!! easy to say i will be back, and did i mention the whole place smelled like wonderful italian food...hmmmm.  i just wish it was a little darker in there, maybe that would help. lots of parking in the lot as well and you can also get your food for pick up delivery.",1
"my wife and i dropped in after the hockey game last night (we won... go yotes!) with 4 friends.  to be honest... this was a visit of convenience as the game went a little late (got outa there after 10 pm) and we were pretty much too lazy to drive out of westgate for any better destination...  the hostess was super-nice and went back to have the kitchen hold onto the soup for us when one of our party asked what the daily choice was (apparently, the kitchen closes at 9, even on game nights).  our server seemed a little shy but was definitely always there when we needed her, so we couldn't really complain at all.  we all ordered different drinks (3 different margaritas, 2 different beers and one of us just had a ginger ale on ice)... none of which were that fantastic.  the margaritas were extremely sweet and i wondered if they actually put alcohol in mine...... and the beers were all just decent at best (their winter bock got passed around to find someone who would drink it..... it sat half full until we left... it was that unimpressive).  okay... so the drinks stink... but the food is gonna save this place, right?!  nope...  we could pretty much only order appetizers from their bar menu since it was after 9... so we went for a variety around the table: 2 different pizzas (with one repeated for a total of 3 pizzas at the table), garlic fries, potstickers, 3 orders of the lobster bisque and southwest egg rolls.  the egg rolls were actually pretty good...... and the pizzas were quite  decent (though not really hot)... but everything else was downright lousy.  the lobster bisque is a total puree... tastes more like cream that someone attempted to flavor with lobster... yuk.  the garlic fries, that some have raved about, were just plain boring french fries with loads of fresh garlic all over.  okay, i like garlic... but c'mon... it was just lazily done to where you couldn't even eat the bottom half of the plate because there was so much overpowering garlic... yuk.  potstickers were boring... and served with a weird asian bbq sauce and hot mustard... yuk again.  good hostess + decent service + lousy drinks + lousy and mediocre food = a place i'm not running to ever visit again...",0
"trail 44 is my favorite trail, i try to jog up and down twice a week, and it's a strenuous workout rewarded by breath-taking views of our great city.   the park as a whole is a jewel, and my only concern is the terribly small parking lot at the base of the trail. which is why i usually park at the hilton. but that's okay by me!",1
"how have i not reviewed the pv?  let me count the reasons to love its non-scene scene... 1) the dirty version of photo hunt is available. 2) you can talk to crazy dudes who try to pick you up by telling you about their job selecting granites and marbles (which takes them to all the finest quarries in ferrara, italy) 3) same dude can then transition into a story about that time he was ""mistakenly"" placed in a mental ward when he really just had a fever which 4) makes you inch closer to the one guy friend you brought with you (which may result in some poor choices later down the line) who is 5) currently playing pool against a dude without some teeth who 6) nearly fought with a group of young jockish hooligans who then 7) went outside where they were out of sight and out of mind because there are not windows or pretenses at the pv and 8) you're too busy drinking your sweet sweet pbr to care.    not a great place for action or good decision making, but a wealth of stories to tell and retell await you on any given night.  i think i have the high score in both the male and female dirty versions of photo hunt on their machine.... unless they unplugged it recently.",1
"me and my lady friend went here for dinner last night. we were a little underdressed but no one seemed to mind. we were promptly greeted and seated. even though this was our first time dinning here, the waitstaff made us feel like we were regulars. the food was amazing. the fried calamari was cooked perfectly and paired with a great tasting spicy marinara. the salads were average but good, and the entrees really stood out. i had the veal marsala, which was off the charts. after 35 years these guys know how to cook veal. it was pounded very thin and melted in my mouth. the lady had the salmon, which was parmesean crusted and very good. it was mild and wonderful. the tiramisu for dessert was also great. next time though i will get the pasta as the were making it fresh in the restauraunt. i have to give that a try. the ambiance was great. i don't think they have changed anything since it opened in 1974. it's not trendy or chic but it is classy and takes you back in time. it does seem like it attracts an older generation, but if more people try this food they will flock there in droves. i can not wait to go back.",1
"i like five guys.  liked them even better when i ate buns and red meat.  now i still eat their fries.........because they are made in a dedicated fryer.  see there is no other item on the menu that they make in their fryers so i don't need to worry about being glutened there.  awesome!  oh, and said fries?  done in peanut oil so they are beyond yum!  they are also very good about doing a bunless burger for you with extra toppings if you cannot eat one.  i've had them bunned (before celiac dx), bunless (while still eating red meat) and none...........  the only bummer here is there are only burgers and fries and drinks on the menu.  no chicken sandwich.........so i cannot even order a bunless chicken.  that makes for only fries i can eat.  luckily, my family can eat here and get me fries and i can run next door to chipotle for a bowl and everyone is happy!  oh, did i tell you that i mix mayo and catsup together for my fries?  try it.  you'll love it or be grossed out by it.  yeah.",1
"boy i thought about this review all day yesterday.  i even wanted to sleep on it before jumping to any conclusions.  when it comes right down to it, i just don't think i am a fan of the two hippies brand. from their poorly spelled ""pizzaria"" sign to their magic burgers that made my wife sick, i haven't seen a lot that should impress me.  i expected this place to be quick when it came to breakfast.  i'm not sure why, i just did.  maybe it was the take-out window or the confined dining area or the to-go boxes that every meal uses.  most of all, i think i expected it to be quick because it is just breakfast food.  it really doesn't take long to throw something on a hot griddle.  after waiting in line for 15 minutes, we got up to the front to order.  they have a ""breakfast bowl"" that includes up to 6 toppings for $6.  pretty good deal, in my opinion, so i was gonna get that.  as i ordered, the guy wrote everything down (in longhand) and then punched a bunch of stuff into the register.  this whole process took a while (and took forever for people with complicated orders).  after asking to see what lemonades they were out of (which as a lot of them), i got a guava one.  we paid for our food and the guy then told us that it would be 30 minutes.    since we couldn't go sit outside because an employee was smoking within about 2ft of the open door (so illegal), we found a small table in the back.  there's not much to look at and really not much going on.  the people are pretty normal and there wasn't a lot of food coming out to look at.  this gave us plenty of time to wonder why some scrambled eggs took 30minutes.  so when our order finally comes out, everything is packaged in these giant plastic take away boxes.  not only does this go against my own inner-hippie but it is bad for your business.  these containers are not cheap and they take up a ton of room in your trash.  both of these issues cost you time and money.  they also don't do much for my ""bowl"" concept of a meal.  in any event, the presentation was underwhelming even for two hippies standards.  the meal was decent but pretty greasy.  i had sausage, potatoes, mushrooms, and jalapeno jack cheese in my 'bowl' which included ""toast.""  that toast was more like buttered bread that was thrown on the same griddle as the greasy potatoes that made the base for my meal.  while the taste of the meal wasn't horrible (the toast was horrible) it really wasn't worth sitting around waiting for 45 minutes.    my issues with this place a many.  they have a giant sign outside that says ""breakfast all day"" yet they stop serving breakfast at 11:30!  matts, the breakfast joynt in scottsdale, black bear, ihop, denny's, etc etc etc all serve breakfast later than 11:30.  what gives with the horribly false advertising?   the bulk of their menu is non breakfast items.  really?!?  i can get a burger at 6am but i can't get bacon and eggs at 1145am?  why do you even serve lunch stuff?  just do breakfast and do it well.  your kitchen wouldn't get so backed up if you didn't have such a giant menu. get rid of the waffles and pancakes.  they are just gonna slow you down.  do the breakfast bowl and some sides.  that's it.  you could bang out breakfast for 1000 in under an hour that way. why don't you have order slips?  wouldn't it make more sense for the people waiting in line to fill out their order instead of having you write everything down?  just have a list of all the items available and have people circle what they want.  you check it to make sure it is 6 or fewer, charge them accordingly, and pass the ticket on to the kitchen.  it would speed up your whole concept. finally - why do you let your employees smoke out front?  you just can't do that.  the next time, i am filing a complaint with the state.",0
my review is not intended for the rooms but only the establishment.  this is not handicapped friendly.   i went there today for happy hour.  when i pulled up to the front entrance i asked about where the handicapped parking was as i did not see any close by.  the directed me to a lot which was far off the beaten path.  i again drove up to the front and proceeded to park nearby where i saw other cars parked.  i was immediately told that i could not park there.  i told them that their handicapped lot was too far for any handicapped person to walk.  they said i could leave the car there but only if i gave them my keys.  i do not give anyone myt car keys.  they called the manager who said he could arrange for someone to follow me to the handicapped lot and bring me back. my other complaint is that when i tried to get back into the restaurant from the patio the doors are too heavy and no button for handicapped to push to open the doors. i would not recommend this place for people who are handicapped or even people who have a problem with walking or who are not strength builders.  you need to be physically fit to stay here.,0
"let me start by saying i absolutely love happy hours! what's not to love, everything's half off and it's happy hour! =)   their reverse happy hour is from 9-close and my friend and i have been going here for probably about a year now for their happy hour. we usually come here maybe once every couple weeks and we are never disappointed.   for their drinks, i usually get their house margaritas for happy hour. it's better frozen but i like my margaritas on the rocks. or sometimes i get a glass of their house wine since i've been an obsessed wine drinker. =p their margaritas are $1 off & their wines are $2 off.   as far as their happy hour food, they have a pretty big selection of items for happy hour actually. i've tried almost everything on their happy hour menu and love everything. however, my favorite is their street tacos. it comes with a side of their special avocado salsa verde sauce. i'm not sure what's in it, but it's amazing! my friend and i will usually get like 3 sides of it! lol. whatever i order there i always have to get a side of this special sauce because it's so dam delicious. =)   their customer service is actually really good. their staff is really friendly and helpful and have a lot of knowledge about the menu.   the only reason i didn't give it a 5 star is because i've never tried their dinner menu so i can't really review it. other than that, i really do enjoy their happy hour and it's actually become one of my favorite happy hour spots. =)",1
"they have a good thing going here and they just don't know it or don't care about their customers.  upon arriving the restaurant was dingy and crowded with people waiting.  i understand most chinese restaurants are dingy, but some still have great food so i ignored the atmosphere.  we waited for about 10 minutes and were seated.  once we were seated we saw about 8 open tables, but still a crowd of people waiting by the door.  obviously, they don't manage seating their patrons very well.  the food was ok, not as good as chinatown in chicago.  their dumplings and siopaio were tasty, but bbq pork was fatty and dry like jerky.  their servers were less than friendly and treated us like we were an inconvenience.  i'd go back to try some items on their menu, since some of their items were good.  the only reason i would go back is because it is hard to find authentic chinese food near scottsdale.  i will give them another chance also because their owner actually read my review and apologized for my bad experience.",0
"i have to go with a solid 4 stars on this one because even if the food is not spicy enough for you, there are so many other reasons to love it.  the atmosphere is great.  i like everything from the tables and booths to the patio.  it is easy to hang out and have a good meal with friends, or to tuck yourself away in a corner...  the service has always been top notch for me.  i have been there when i was in a hurry, and i was able to eat and run without having to beg for service.  i also have had long leisurely dinners and was always happy with the attentive, but not pushy service.  i love their pad thai.  it's a little different from the other places i have gone, in a good way.  i'm only sorry they have had such a time with the construction outside their door.  a nice place doesn't deserve that hassle.",1
"i arrived at 3:30 pm on sunday afternoon.  there was one table just finishing their meal when i arrived.  the waitress met me at the register and asked where i would like to sit.  she advised me that the restaurant closes at 4 pm to change over to dinner service, so i had 30 minutes to complete my meal.  she asked what i wanted to drink and went to get my water.  on her return, i told her i would like som tom, no green beans, thai hot, with an order of jasmine rice.  she asked my consideration as she did not have her pad and could i wait while she went to get it?  away she went to retrieve her order book, and on her return, she asked me again what i wanted.  i repeated my order and she wrote it down.  off to the kitchen she went, looking at her watch as she walked away.  the table seated next to me were finished with their meal.  one of the diners opened the folio, looked at the bill and whistled.  he pulled out a card and walked up to the register.  the waitress came and processed his sale.  as they were walking out, another couple entered the restaurant.  the waitress let them know they had about 25 minutes before the restaurant closed to change over from lunch to dinner, and they might want to consider ordering to go so they would not feel rushed.  they answered that they would do their best to be done by 4 pm, so she brought them to a table.  she presented their menus and asked what they would like to order.  one diner asked for some water and a moment to consider the choices.  the other said they were ready.  the waitress advised she would bring water as soon as they placed their orders.  once this was done, she went to the kitchen.    on her return, she brought water for the other table.  she went to the back service area, by the door to the outdoor dining, where she took out her compact and proceeded to powder her nose.  after that, she reapplied her lipstick.  she went to the kitchen and returned with my salad.  it appears the kitchen prepares their papaya ahead of time and the green beans are incorporated into the salad then.  the chef picked out the larger pieces of green bean, but what remained was lots of small pieces of chopped up green bean in the salad.  portion size was discouraging, about 1 cup of salad on top of 2 cups of chopped lettuce, and while there was no mention of carrots in the salad, there was more carrot than there was papaya.  rice was about 3/4 of a cup and apparently near the bottom of the pan.  it was dry and sticky.  the spice on the salad rated a 2.  i asked the waitress for more chile and lime.  she told me they were out of lime, but i could have lemon instead.  i repeated the request for chile, advising that lemon would not be an adequate substitute.  she returned with some chili.  i sprinkled this on my salad, but it was of no benefit.   while som tom should have accents of fish sauce, lime, palm sugar and chile, i tasted no sweet or lime.  the chile was disappointing.    probably the worst part of the experience was the dirty table next to mine.  it was never cleared while i was at the restaurant.    after bringing me the chile for my order, the waitress went to the back service area and again applied powder and lipstick, then she brought the order to the other table.  she did not clear the table next to mine, nor did she offer to refill my water, though i was at the bottom of the glass.  this place may, as i have heard, have great drink prices for happy hour and cheap munchies for the same, but the salad and rice i received were certainly not the focal point of the chef.  i am doubting i will try this place again, as it seems to be all about the happy hour crowd.",0
"two words that you'd never expect in the same sentence.  however that is what await you at kai.  native american and french cuisine, two cultures you don't expect together, but the chef at kai blends these two types of cuisine beautifully.  located in the dazzling wild horse pass, this is a perfect blend of native american and french cuisine.   the 7 course meal called the ""short story"" started with a duck confetti on top of a reduced raspberry for the amuse.  next came a local heirloom ripened tomato tart.  thirdly was the freshly fileted spanish sea bass.  the skin side was slightly seared so it was crispy.  the sauce was a mixture of lemon and orange extract on a bed of vegetables.   i'm a big fan of white fish, but the bass here i found to be a bit overcooked.  the usual flaky meat ofa white sea fish wasn't very pronounced in this dish.   following the intermezzo which was very forgettable (because i forgot) was their signature dish, an exquisite grilled buffalo tenderloin.    the buffalo sat on top of a corn puree and beans syrup sauce.   the texture and tenderness matched some of the best filet mignon i've ever had coupled with a gaming flavor.  before the dessert was a cheese sampler.   they paired it with a fresh honey jam.  the just right amount of sweetness of the honey complimented the fine selection of cheese.   the dessert was a cheesecake which seemed common, however the complimentary chocolate dessert was delectable.      even though the sea bass could've been better (but then again i do have high expectations :-), this place still deserves a 5 start for its amazing atmosphere and impeccable service.   where else would they let you choose 4 different types of fruits to put in your water.  :-)  even the menu has a southwestern painting  in the front.",1
"from the outside this place looks like all fun and games.  $2 beer, a party atmosphere and free food during happy hour.  whats not to like right?  unfortunately the music is way 2 loud when you get in.  its really difficult to have a conversation.  the free food has made me sick on more than 1 occasion.  the service is slow to the point that i usually go to the bar to order a beer.  i would give this place at least 3 stars if they turned down the music a couple of notches.",0
"i won some gift certificates at my school's raffle, and never having eaten here before, my husband and i decided to check it out. we were both quite hungry, so we ordered the croissant appetizer. they were under-baked, greasy, and drizzled with honey- both unexpected and disappointing. hubby's clam chowder was full of grit and my salad was drenched in dressing, topped with a handful of chopped mushy tomato, and also full of grit. the grit police must have been on vaycay. hubby ordered the prime rib sandwich (which is one of his favorites at houston's) and it turned out to be a full slab of nearly tasteless meat which was poorly trimmed and ribboned with tough membranes on a lame toasted roll. he would have had to tear into it like a neanderthal to eat it like a sandwich, so he ended up eating as much as he could stand with knife and fork. the au jus tasted like bouillon- and super strong at that. my entree was far better- a tender and perfectly cooked fillet of beef (although i had ordered the less expensive sirloin) with a delicious baked potato with all the trimmings. i ended up giving him about 1/3 of my steak since i felt so badly for his disaster of a meal. when we complained to the manager, he offered us more gift certificates, and we turned them down. you, too, should just say no to this dark, inexplicably crowded, disaster of a restaurant.",0
"i wish i liked this place more because i love mexican food, it's in a great location and it's huge. however, i think the food is pretty bland. there are so many good mexican restaurants in phoenix and i just don't think this measures up. i am a big fan of fish tacos and the ones here are just meh. also, the last time we went someone ordered the queso with chorizo and everyone's stomach was hurting for a good 24 hrs after. i also think it's a bit overpriced.",0
"that has got to be one of the coolest patios in town for a get together.  i was another of the yelp group (and friends) in attendance last night for happy hour.  we had a long table reserved for us.  the bartender was also our waiter for the evening.  to my knowledge, with all of us moving around, i don't think he screwed up a single order of food or drink.  the manager, matt, came by to check on us several times.  i arrived fairly early and before i was tempted to work my way through multiple baskets of the wonderful bread and pesto i ordered a serving of crab cakes.  they were quite good, certainly not enough volume to replace an entree.  i was offered several choices of pizza slices and accepted a bruscetta one which was delicious.  of the many pizzas ordered i did not hear one person that was less than satisfied.  i do of sort regret not trying the white pizza but i was at that not full but no longer hungry point where i should, but don't always, stop.  we did cause one hiccup in the evening, many of us decided it was time to go at the same time and with all the separate bills to figure out at once it swamped the entire staff to the point a couple of people at the bar complained they couldn't get a drink.  most of the night we ordered as individuals or pairs as we saw fit so we never overwhelmed the kitchen or the server.  i have yet to figure out why groups of people (non business) that are going to be there for a couple of hours anyway have to all order and get served at the same time.  we must have at least looked like we were well behaved, matt invited us back.",1
"kristi d just reminded me that i love yucca  :)  great local music spot, espcially because there is no cover charge!  only reason i am not giving this place 5 starts is because it is sooooo loud and normally takes forever to get something from the bar.",1
"one word can sum up my experience at maizie's- unremarkable.   the restaurant is a cute place, and i really wanted to like it.   the service was slow. our server would disappear for long periods of time, leaving us with empty glasses, and we watched as other tables got their food, even though we had ordered before them. i am not sure what is so difficult about making a sandwich, but clearly there was some rocket science type stuff going on back there that caused a 25 minute wait for the food.  i had the veggie burger with fries, and my sister had a salad with ancho orange dressing and a cup of potato soup.   i didn't try the salad, but the dressing was described to me as ""tinted mayonnaise with no flavor"". the thick and chunky potato soup got a better response- it was actually really good.   about the veggie burger...kudos to maizie's for making them in-house, but for crying out loud- could you give them some flavor, please? i now understand why the burger is served with apricot tzatziki and red onion marmalade- without them, the burger is tasteless. ah well, the fries were good.   one more nit picky thing that drives me crazy about this place- spelling errors on the menu. seriously, there isn't a computer today that doesn't come with some form of spell check. use it.   i doubt i will be back to maizie's. nothing about the visit thrilled me.",0
"geee-ross!  the other half and i got take-out for this place.   but first a little back-story....  my dad's whole family worked at a chinese restaurant in philly from before i was born until the late 1990's.  my mother says she craved chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on chinese in the womb. i bless her for having done so. i love chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  i've tried chinese in every city and country i've ever lived or visited, as i always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. i can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  and lord knows i love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  great nite, rite?  a few weeks ago i convinced the better half to go pick up gourmet house of hong kong, if i paid and he drove. deal. done.  i ordered on the phone - no problems. it's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  we queued up the dvd and we're ready to go.  the fried rice was yummy and ok.  not the best i've had but not the worst either.  the bbq pork app was good and i liked the dipping sauce it came with. everything else was skank.  i'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. they were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.    i'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on yelp seemed pretty good.  the place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, i can't comment on that -- but i would never get take-out from here again.  at least we didn't get sick.  it was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  i even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with chinese take-out, when i left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge.",0
"the rusty spur has the distinction of being the oldest cowboy bar in arizona and a gen-u-ine registered historic landmark. it's even got a hitchin' post for yer horses out front. the spur has been patronized by the likes of john wayne and clint eastwood -- although never while i've been there. there's great live music four afternoons and six nights a week. other good things include plenty of parking, no cover, and a fun venue to people-watch.",1
"in my continued effort to find good barbeque in the desert i stopped by lucille's for lunch. there were a good number of customers, but it was not overcrowded. the restaurant had several employees working as well. the ribs sounded very good, as did the chicken. i thought i would go with the rib & chicken combo, then i noticed the carolina baked potato & salad combo. that stood out for me because in atlanta i used to go regularly to champs bbq and always ordered the hickory baked potato. the description on lucille's menu was similar, so i made my selection.  the waiter brought out complimentary buttermilk rolls and cinnamon butter. okay, he said complimentary rolls, but it was a singular roll. it was a little hard, but edible. tasted like something you would get from the kfc drive thru. it took several minutes for the waiter to bring my diet coke and i never received a refill while i was there.  the meal arrived and the first thing i noticed was the salad. it took me back to 1975 when i good salad included iceberg lettuce and cherry tomatoes. yep, that's what it was...plus some carrot shavings and croutons. after seeing the purple cabbage, i believe it was the prepackaged salad in a bag from the grocery...inspired by 1975. the ranch dressing continued the time warp. it was very runny - i think from being the final remnants of the original bottle of dressing and they added water to extend the number of servings. very blah and plain.  another interesting item on the plate was the small watermelon wedge. wtf?   the baked potato definitely was not champs. it was dry, which okay i get that i can pick my sauce for the topping. i chose the dark bbq sauce. it was good - sweet and molassessy (is that a word?). i took the pulled pork version of the potato and it included sour cream, cheese, scallions and was just okay for me. i ate it, but i will continue my search for a good local bbq place.  another thing i wouldn't recommend is going there if you are on a typical work lunch. as i mentioned it wasn't overcrowded and there was staff on hand, but the service was slow. the coke took a while, when the food was brought out he asked if it looked okay and i didn't see him again until i was finished and impatiently waiting on the check (several minutes after being finished...)  the price for the potato was $9.75 - probably a touch too high for what you receive. there wasn't that much meat on the potato. the coke was also $2.95 - so maybe water would be a better choice.   slow service, slightly higher price and just average potato (below average salad) makes this place just okay for me. i tried it, but i would prefer to go elsewhere.",0
okay here it goes..while their food remains consistently delicious.. their service leaves a lot to be desired. this issue is with the bartenders. a group of us showed  up for a birthday dinner. the regular wait was an hour.. for us (party of 11) was 1 1/2. my friend carlos and i walked  up to the outside bar and no bartender to be found.. ok? no problem..inside we went. okay so we approach the inside bar. we stand there and are unnoticed  by the 3 people behind the bar. finally a woman greets us..imagine janis joplin and joan jett having a love child and now she's in her 40's..she takes my order a single amstel light...she takes carlos' order.. 2 drinks. she cards us.. i show her my id and he shows his. she explains she needs to see and card the person he is buying the drink for. okay that's a pain.. but fine. so what does she do. she leaves me at the bar while she goes with carlos out to the crowded patio to card his wife.. really? how about you take care of me since i have met all the requirements? okay? so while she is gone..another bartender comes up and takes my order. as he is about to grab me a beer janice jett returns and says something to him he looks at me and i say the beer is for me im on my own tab he turns back and he walks away?? wtf? what does it take to get a friggin' beer. so janice jett gives carlos 2 drinks then i finally get mine and what does she do? she puts it all on carlos' tab? are you freakin kidding me? janice jett you are the worst bartender ever. you did nothing right in this transaction. needless to say we ended up with her as our server.. murphy's law..and she tried to card me again! i clued her in that she had done it just 20 minutes ago and her memory kicked in. then we ask for more drinks. half the table received theirs..and she made the rest of us wait as she doled out waters. waters are great but we ordered beer..give us what we ordered! then give us waters..ive never been so frustrated or irritated. it was almost laughable. needless to say i didnt bother to order any more drinks after that.. what's the point..i wouldnt get it in a timely fashion anyway.,0
"for the record: i'm just not that into salmonella.   we hit this place on a wed after work for some snacks and a beer. we needed a fun place to go to fairly quickly because we have a little one that hits the sack early.   it was still happy hour -it goes until 7, so that goes in the plus column, so we ordered quesadillas ($4 on hh menu) and a cobb salad to share. the quesadillas were really only worth about $4- two of the pieces had nothing but cheese in them. the two pieces in the middle had some tomatoes, green onions and black beans. definitely not worth the more than $4 they normally are.   then, our salad showed up with chicken that was completely raw in the middle. all the way through every slice- raw, pink, jelly. we sent it back and the server was pretty apologetic.   when it arrived, the manager brought it and literally all he was was, ""sorry,"" and dropped it off at the table. maybe i'm a snob, but if i had almost made an entire family  seriously ill, i would have offered to pay for the salad.   we will probably skip this place and just hit four peaks from here on out.",0
"someone told me about this place and their all you can eat spaghetti. they also mentioned that they have great meatballs...so i had to check it out myself.  the first thing that bothered me was the noise level...it's like all the conversations going on in this place remained within the walls. however, the staff was very friendly and the service was good.  i had the artichoke, shrimp & crab dip which was good, but i wish it had more chucks of crab. i obviously tried their spaghetti with meatballs which i thought was good, but not  the best i've had. the sauce was a bit to watery for me and the meatballs just didn't have that ""wow"" factor, but it was good (just not the best). i had also ordered a customize calzone and that was without a doubt fabulous! the size and flavor were definitely in the ""wow"" factor. this helped to push the rating to a 4 star plus the service.",1
"not really a big fan of used things, but i decided to check it out one night with friends after dinner.  lots of selections, but it's not for me.  at least i can tell my friends that i've actually been to one.  good luck if you are a like buying cheap things.",0
"this place is so good! the food is great, location is a gem, the servers are friendly. i'll definitely be back. their bloody mary's are yum!!",1
"i've been back many times since i wrote that review, and they continue to get into their groove there and impress. i still find that things are always changing, however.  for example, bonnie and i went for a weekday hh about 5-6 weeks ago and were told there were food specials (half off apps, i think) but no drink specials -- but there was an ""all day everyday day"" special on one of their top shelf vodkas (which worked out really well for me.) i come back last night pretty early, around 4, and hh had just started: no food discounts, but half off every drink except their sangria and their ""house"" drinks like specialty martinis and mojitos, etc. still a great deal, got another top shelf vodka drink for like $3. service was still great and friendly, and pizza was still delicious!",1
"the place is nice. service was ok. the waiter poured too much water where it splashed on the table and just said ""oops""...  we got their deep dish pizza whth roasted garlic and fresh basil; their definition of deep dish is thick crust, so that was disappointing. their pizza sauce tasted like rotten tomatoes. yucky. i got the tomato bisque and i've had better tomato bisque in a student cafeteria. we also got their sample appetizer platter and i only liked their avocado rolls and their mozzerella sticks. the rest was just gross.   i don't recommend this place at all. only reason they got 2 stars instead of one is because i liked the way the place looked.",0
"3 stars for food and ambience.  minus 1 star for service.  cibo is the average answer to pizzeria bianco.  i can't believe they've even been compared  - the only similarity i can think of is geography.  the crusts are worlds apart - at least on the night we went.   we chose to take some out of town guests to cibo last night because of: (1) all the praises we read on yelp and other media (2) the fact that it's one of the few well-regarded independent places open on a monday night (3) it looked cute from the outside  apparently, other people thought the same.  all the tables for four were full inside so we took a table in the patio, which turned out to be a blessing because we got lots of privacy to talk.    the downside though was getting the attention of the waiter.  ice water was poured and menus were handed out as soon as we sat down but the waiter appeared over 15 min later.  when we ordered a refill on a glass of wine after the appetizer, he came with it almost at the end of our meal.  we order the antipasto speciale, large ($17) to share.  the plate was huge:  generous slices of prosciutto, 3 slices of bresaola with shaved pecorino on arugula, 4 slices of grilled zucchini,  mounds of balsamic pearl onions, giant olives, grilled red peppers with capers and parmesan, and cherry tomatoes with bocconcini and basil.  pizzas are split between rosse (red) and bianche (white).  on the waiter's recommendation, we ordered these:  - red: diavola (tomato sauce, mozz and spicy salame)  $13 - white: siena (grilled zucchini, mozz, speck (smoked proscuitto) and pecorino)  $14  verdict: cibo vs pizzeria bianco  the toppings were generous and tasty but the major complaint we had was the crust.  pizza's all about the crust.  this was more like charred bread - it was not crusty in the least bit.  the dough had a nice chew to it but no crunch whatsoever.    chris bianco's dough is so brilliant because there's an awesome contrast between the crusty exterior and the pillowy interior.  chris' crust is so thin that you can inhale slice after slice but here we had trouble eating more than 2 slices.    even though this pizza was baked in a brick oven, there was no smokiness to it - almost as if it was flash-baked.  pizzeria bianco's crust not only has texture but a complex-flavored interior and smoky exterior.  eating pizza will never be the same again...  winner:  pizzeria bianco",0
"harlow's, you are overrated.  your potatoes are greasy and seem like the cook couldn't decide what they were, just make real hashbrowns.  your eggs are too expensive and are not worth 2.50 a piece, ridiculous. the toast was coated is unmelted butter and the coffee was cheap.  i do not understand how you get] so many customers or why you are such a tempe tradition, go to chompies or essence.",0
"a sober saturday night when all my friends were out drinking led me to this restaurant. 30 minutes on the train and a 5 minute walk and i was here. upon walking in, i had high hopes.   khai hoan has the typical ""we aren't trying to impress anyone"" vietnamese restaurant atmosphere. it was filled with a lot of asian folks speaking their native tongue, unlike a lot of places full of whitey.  the woman who owns the place was very cordial and although her english was somewhat broken, she was tremendously helpful to me. a walk through the kitchen to wash my hands revealed how clean the place has to be kept. obviously they wouldn't want anyone walking to the restroom and seeing a dirty kitchen. hopes still high!  my bowl of bun came, #19 ($7.25) with egg rolls and pork, my usual bowl at any vietnamese restaurant. usually, the bowl is oversized, giving you room to mix up your ingredients once you put your favorite condiments on it. unfortunately, the bowl was packed to the brim so i had to make some adjustments on how i eat the dish. as for taste, the overwhelming flavor of barbecue pork dominated everything in the bowl, which was a delicious flavor, but somewhat disappointing that i couldn't taste the sauce.  this restaurant is also in a pretty skeezy neighborhood. i'd forgotten how long it has been since i have encountered your run of the mill trailer park white crack/meth heads in public. they kind of scare me. i'd rather deal with a drunk bum anyday.   +2 for the service  -1 for the overwhelming taste of barbecue -1 for the awful neighborhood",1

"in phoenix, there are essentially 3 types of indian restaurants. none of the restaurants in the valley can compare to good ones in real cities but there are some good ones: royal taj, guru palace, dehli palace. then there are tolerable ones: india palace, tandoori times, indian paradise and then there is everything else (places you shouldn't go to).  india gate is one of these places.  i'm indian and we tend to be picky about which indian restaurants we eat at. just like you wont find a sicilian at the olive garden, yoy won't find a desi at india gate unless they work at intel and are too lazy to drive to a decent restaurant.",0
"this hotel embodies the meaning of customer service, especially jeffrey who runs the high tea service. i recently visited the ritz carlton for a high tea lunch. when my mom and i arrived, we realized that we were the only two guests who had made a reservation for high tea and we started to think twice about having high tea. while we were in the midst of contemplating our decision, jeffrey walked up to us with a smile on his face. he was so friendly and welcoming and encouraged us to do high tea. he was so welcoming that we immediately made up our mind and started our very own private high tea experience! although we were the only two guests doing high tea, they still ""put on the ritz"" for us by bringing in jeffrey to serve us and a pianist to play the baby grand piano during our tea. we felt like royalty!   jeffrey isn't a server. he is in charge of the high tea and incredibly experienced. he is a tea sommelier and in fact, makes the teas they serve himself! after seating us, jeffrey went over the tea menu with us. knowing that we were in the presence of an expert, we asked jeffrey to take the lead and pick the three teas for our adventure. our first course included a variety of tea sandwiches along with our first tea which was a peach tea. we leisurely enjoyed our tea and sandwiches and enjoyed the beautiful piano music. because we were the only high tea guests, we had the undivided attention of jeffrey which was a treat in itself. the second course consisted of delicious scones and three different jams presented in chocolate contains that we could eat! it was truly delectable. the tea to accompany that course was an herbal raspberry tea. our final course was a three tier tray of small deserts, some of which were infused with the house-made teas! we enjoyed chocolate chai tea with this course. every bite was delicious and the entire experience was girly, classy and royal.   there's a reason the ritz carlton coined the phrase ""putting on the ritz."" even though we were the only two guests who reserved high tea, they still pulled out all the stops and treated us like royalty. jeffrey knows the secret to customer service and because he walked over and made us feel welcome, we stayed and ultimately had an experience that i will always remember.   **** note: they do several events throughout the year to go with high tea, including ladies social events, hat events, etc. keep an eye on their calendar so you too can ""put on the ritz!""",1
"many of times i've overheard someone in passing talk about how ""ra has the best sushi, ever!""  i've only eaten here once. it was one of the first places i ate after moving here from l.a. and man was i dissapointed. the first bite i took into the my tuna sashimi, i was greeted with a nice frozen center. nothing like fresh...uhhhh....frozen sushi. i sent that back.   it's horribly overpriced too, not to mention douche/boob job central. i'd never pay that much for shitty sushi again.",0
"meh. we arrived at 5:45pm and immediately got a table. drinks arrived and we placed an order, then we waited, and waited, and waited, asked the waiter where the food was, waited some more, finally got food. this place makes great rolls, but the service isn't consistent. our order got lost and they apologized, but come on - if the table that was seated 15 minutes after us got food wouldn' t you think to ask where our food was before we mentioned it???",0
"enjoyed lunch today with friends and my gourmet son at pita jungle. it's hip and trendy, but don't let that stop you from coming to visit. the food was very good.   since the weather is so nice out, we were able to take advantage of patio dining. our server was nice, but honestly, i don't remember her name. in fact, i'm not sure she introduced herself, but one of my friends knew her from a previous restaurant they both worked at.  we enjoyed the falafel platter and the small hummus as starters. the falafel was flavorful, tender, and not overdone at all. i hate hockey puck falafel. my vegetarian friend enjoyed the roasted vegetable salad, my son had the pesto pizza, our other friends had the lavosh pizza, and i had the chicken schwarma pita. all were very tasty. my son enjoyed his pizza so much that he didn't even speak the entire meal.   i'm looking forward to coming back soon to try out some other treats! i have been told via my facebook check-in that i must try the nachos so next time, it's on my list!",1
"i miss the days when flight attendants took pride in their appearance and were over the top nice.  the flight attendants for us airways are run down and crabby.  there was an older indian woman on my flight who did not speak english and they were very rude to her, it was hard to watch.    it really chaps my hide that luggage is now $25 so i've made adjustments in my packing to fit everything i need into two carry-ons.  at least they make you aware of the fee though, what i did not know is that they now charge for meals on flights across the country.  for $8 i got the nastiest sandwich they could throw together.  they also make you recycle, which is really cool but i wanted to throw away my plastic drink cup, put my tray up and pass out but i had to wait 20 minutes because they weren't collecting plastic at that time.  here's a tip us airways, when you treat your customers like crap, it puts them in a bad mood.  it's not a good idea to put people in a bad mood when they're cramped in  a small area, surrounded by strangers and can't get out of their seat for 5 hours.",0
"i absolutely love the sandwiches here. i don't think i've ever tasted anything that was short of fantastic- from the side dishes to the variety of sweet munchies such as the captain crunch or fruity pebble treats. i only knock a star off for the fact that i have to ""get over"" the theme. it's kinda funny, sure, but it makes me feel a little skeezy to eat at a weed-themed restaurant. at least it knows it's nitch and doesn't try and be anything it's not- it's an inexpensive sandwich shop near a college campus that serves brownies and kool-aid.   that aside, i still regularly enjoy their food despite their hippie atmosphere and often take out of town guests here (provided they're not too uptight, of course).   it's one of those places that, regardless of your feeling on the theme, you should probably at least try once.",1
"i was really looking forward to finally trying out the new sheraton's new bar. man, was i disappointed! one - it's just a hotel bar, and it *felt* like a hotel bar. i'm glad i only came for happy hour and not a nice meal because i totally felt like i was just in a hotel. beer - ok selection (random new belgium beers i'd never heard of, a four peaks beer i'd never heard of - how is that possible? - a nut brown ale, a lagunitas, a couple hefeiwizens... all in all it was about 10 beers on hh special) that were only $3 on hh ($3.75) otherwise. that's pretty price. no wines by the glass under $10 or on hh special - bummer. good sounding food selection on hh - notice i say it sounds good, but it was not good, not at all! we got the sliders ($9) and sweet potato tots ($4). sliders (2) were dry-meat, bland little things that came with fried onions and some kind of horseradish sauce that was just terrible. sweet pot tots came out *burned* (really?) and not finely chopped and mashed back together in tot shaped and fried, like regular tots, but simply cut into tot shape and then fried (or, in this case, burned). which means when you bite into it, it tastes like a grease ball. they came with ranch (again, really?) for dipping, and (now i just sound nit-picky, but this place is supposed to be nice, right?) it was the watery, runny kind of ranch that reminded me of the kind you got in middle school.  my friend got the chicken wrap that actually looked pretty good and she seemed to enjoy it, and a side of fries, which came with ketchup and ...well i don't know the other dip was supposed to be. it was orange, so i hoped it was a chipotle mayo or fancy mustard that would help my tots. but no, it was thick - but congealed like it had been untouched and left out for awhile, and tasted terrible. i really can't place what it was supposed to be or taste like - the seasoning that came on the fries didn't help either. how can you mess up fries?!?! (ok, to solve the mysery, i just looked up the menu and it says ""creamy garlic"" was the indiscernible fry dip. um, what??)  ok, enough bad stuff, here's what i did like. root beer (virgil's) on tap. that's pretty cool. and, my all time favorite part - the prints from mexican artist theresa villegas they had up (though sort of out of sight by the bathrooms). she does these amazing prints inspired by the traditional la loteria card game (her prints are of the same name). i originally heard of her when she showed at the mesa arts center two years ago and have never talked to anyone who knew about her, let alone seen them anywhere! i thought that was amazing. also, when the bartender overheard us talking about having ridden the light rail, she informed us that by showing our ticket we got 25 percent off our entire bill! wow, that's a great deal (i think that only runs through the end of this month, though).",0
"i came here for lunch with my mother and sister.  it was the middle of the afternoon, so we did not take advantage of the byob.  sadly.  however, the sushi was delicious!  we tried the volcano roll, the caterpillar roll, and various sashimi and nigiri.  everything was fresh and tasty.  i can't wait to go back for dinner with a nice bottle of something special :)",1
"for those of you from cali and not near a winco, this is just like food for less. it's huge and you bag your own groceries. then again this is actually bigger.  first time here and as much as the helpers have me a whole lot of great info, this place is still overwhelming.  for newbies, come prepared to spend a lot of time whether you want to or not. it just takes a while to find things bc it's so expansive. lots to choose from. prices do seem somewhat competitive. doesn't necessarily have everything though as big as it is. i was craving blueberries and none were to be seen. no biggie though.  the self serv bins were cool. you can even buy cereal, honey and agave like that.  and they have a machine that makes fresh peanut butter and almond butter. crazy!",1
"i will never ever go to quiznos or subway ever again!  cheba hut is definitely the best and most creative sub shop around. i had the white widow sandwich on a garlic herb bun.  it came with chicken smothered in ranch, cheese, bacon,  and mushrooms.  i also added peppers and mustard and it was completely awesome.   looking at the menu, i realize that really whatever i am in the mood for, they have.  i would give it -1 star for not having green chilies, but i will survive (and so will be esophogus)  prices are very reasonable and i loved it that i had the choice of an 8"" sub.  my biggest issue with the likes of subway is that i could only get 6 or 12"" when all i wanted was something in the middle.  i found a new love in cheba hut.  yummy!!!! and the decor rocks!!!!!",1

"overpriced for ""beep-beep-beep"" everything, but some of the table jukeboxes work!  --omelet was too perfectly formed to be freshly made, ew. where did it come from? --they must have silenced the microwaves, or the beeping from the ""kitchen"" would have drowned out the music. --not much food prepared here, just reheat, serve, and charge a bundle for it  the recent availability of mostly-ready-to-serve food provided by shamrock and its local competitors is mostly just scary. don't have a grill? no problem, we can make your eggs benedict for you, almost-ready-to-serve. no toaster? no problem. we can deliver it pre-toasted.

"dominicks is a vegas style restaurant that has taken over the likes of the scottsdale quarter.  although they have the glitz and glamour i didn't feel their food held up to the price or glitz.  they use a spice rub on their steaks that most of the guests didn't enjoy and the fish i ordered was quite bland except for the excessive amount of salt they used on it.  i would have to say that the side dishes were a disappointment as well.  the tater-tots, although they sound fun, weren't edible due to the amount of grease they had in them and the mac & cheese wasn't very good either.  again, everything was seasoned with excessive amounts of salt.  overall the party of 8 i was with didn't enjoy this overpriced meal.",0
this review is based on their mini-golf and that alone. everything else looked pretty useless as well but the mini-golf was an absolute joke. they had 3 courses to choose from and all three were very poorly designed and run down like the place has been around for 20+ years. if you want a real mini-golf experience i suggest going to castles and coasters.,0
"definitely thought i had reviewed this place before. but i guess not...  i had tried their catering before, and it was pretty good. so i decided i would try their restaurant food.  bad idea. i ordered chicken tikka masala and got chicken tikka soup. the masala that was there was super watered down, and the chicken was a mix of white meat and brown meat, some of the brown meat was so tough that i had to leave a few pieces of the chicken uneaten. the naan was really good, but the chicken tikka masala was very sub par. to make matters worse, it cost a whopping $7. when $7 gets you much more food at other places, i doubt you are going to venture back here. i suppose it was worth a try, but its not worth the return.",0
"if i am going to spend $7.59 on yogurt, it had better be the best yogurt i have ever tasted. was this the best yogurt i ever tasted? no. absolutely not. the soft serve frozen yogurt they used to sell at smitty's blows this out of the water!  i have been told that this is just a bad location, and that may be true, but i assume that they all use the same products and have similar setups. it is a franchise, after all.  i walked in and there were a ton of people in there but only one employee, so the line was backed up. there were no instructions on how this whole ""do-it-yourself"" thing works, so i just assumed you get a cup, put some shit in it, and you pay one flat rate. that  was a $7.59 mistake. i can't afford to be making those types of mistakes. we are in a recession, people!  i ended up putting in a squirt of each of the flavors since there was no way to sample any of them (minus pistachio.. i cannot stomach the idea). the only one i would consider eating again is the cafe latte one. the others were too tart for my liking.  i did like the extensive topping offerings but was disappointed with the little cheesecake bites. they don't even taste like cheesecake. i want my cheesecake bites to taste like cheesecake. is that too much to ask?!?  it probably doesn't help that i am lactose intolerant and that it was so hot outside that the yogurt melted uber quick, and of course i spilled it all over myself. i know that none of those things are directly mojo's fault, but hey, i'm on a roll.   sorry mojo... i'm just not that into you.",0

"before anyone beats me up over this two star rating, i have to say that the whipped cream donut is 5 stars by itself. however, the three times that i have been there, the apple fritters and the buttermilk bars have been raw in the middle.  the other donuts here do not have the same trouble, but they are definitely sweeter that they should be.  don't get me wrong, i just mean that one should be able to taste the donut not just sugar-dough.  the amount of sugar used overwhelms the taste of the donuts.  truthfully  rainbow is probably 2.5 stars--2 stars is too harsh, but 3 is a tad high.  again though, the whipped cream donut is in a class by itself.  oh, and the area is sketchy too.  :/",0
"lee's sandwiches rules. they have amazing bread, a huge selection and a fantastic price!!!  i have never heard one bad word about any of the sandwiches, and have been here over a dozen times myself.  i always get the egg salad. it is absolutely amazing. i also recommend the vegetarian asian sandwich. my old boss used to get the spring rolls/egg rolls and eat ten or twelve at a time.   the sandwiches are huge and are normally $3 or $4 and they have tons of different bubble tea options and sides.   the place is really cool too- bright, open spaces with lots of neon and extremely clean.   great place for lunch, especially if you are on the go. buttttt... the only drawback is they do not accept credit cards, so bring cash. if you forget, they have an atm.  oh, and make sure you bring an extra buck and take a baguette home... they sell their day old break for a buck and it is so worth it!",1
"this place is a joke! i have been shopping here for years since both my current and previous residences make it the closest market to me.   they always used to be open until midnight, but nooooo they decided to start closing at 10pm... wtf! i used to always go after work at 10:30 and they would talk about it being the 1030 rush where it would get really busy. what shit for brains thinks it is a good quality idea to close up before your daily rush?  also the place always has long lines. it is not that it's really understaffed, it just seems like most of the employees are fucking off somewhwere. i know most of them by name i shop here so much, and they are not a good group of managers.   additionally, they close the deli counter at like 7pm.... seriously, wtf is wrong with this place?  oh and did i mention some illegal (i have proof he was illegal) backed into my car there and the security guard (not a safeway employee but still should maintain professionalism) told me that it looked like it was my fault.   screw you safeway!  see you tomorrow.  edit, forgot to add how they are always out of their house brand water. seems like half the time i go there they don't have it. and yes, i agree with other reviews there are always some hotties in there.",0
"this place is gringo heaven, the music is much louder than it needs to be , the food is average by the time you stand in line and order, wait to pay and get to your table your food is less that hot. a co worker recommend this place trust me there are to many good mexican hole in the walls that are clean and have great food in this neighborhood",0
"who loves locally owned, family run businesses? and who toots their horn loudly when it's warranted? this girl! and el ranchero in wickenburg is about as good as it gets. sure the decor is rustic and a tiny bit tacky, but what good, authentic mexican place doesn't have these qualities? what will make you come back is the food. and oh how i enjoyed the food.....  our group of 8 was seated promptly and greeted very warmly by the owners as though we were old friends. the chips and salsa were excellent; and not just because it was chips and salsa but because there were two different heat levels as well as a fantastic bean dip that were just waiting for a warm, perfectly sized chip.   we enjoyed chimichangas, enchiladas, street tacos, and even taco salad ranging from beef to pork to chicken and every single thing we had was delicious. my baby had a cheese crisp that was about as awesome of a cheese crisp as i've ever tried. and it was only a cheese crisp for goodness sake! it was really that good. another great thing is that if you are trying to watch the added calories that refried beans can add to your plate, they will substitute black beans for you instead!   our drinks were kept full, our plates were served hot and fresh, our entire crew was treated like family. i.cannot.wait.to.go.back.to.el.ranchero. soon!",1
"lenny is the man and his burgers are some of the best you'll find in the valley! i first met lenny and his family at the burger battle a couple months ago. after experiencing how great their burgers tasted and how nice the family was, my girlfriend and i decided we'll have to check out one of the actual restaurants in phoenix. i am glad we did because it reminded me why we gave lenny's burger our vote for best at the burger battle!   my girlfriend and i both ordered the ranch bacon cheeseburger and it was out of this world! lenny came by to check and see how everything was and we informed him that everything was just as delicious as we remembered it from the contest. it was nice to get to talk to him about lenny's burger history in phoenix too. the fries are awesome and i recommend trying one of their six dipping sauces. everything is reasonably priced, the seating area is nicely designed and clean, and service was great! i'll definitely come back to lenny's to satisfy my frequent burger cravings.",1
"i loved it here! walking in it was really nice to see that almost every table was filled and that everyone looked pretty happy. we decided to sit at the sushi bar where we were greeted by the nicest sushi chefs ever! they were super friendly, talkative, and created some really delicious tasty goodness. it instantly felt like i was in someones living room having some really good food.   shimagamo also has what looks to be an outstanding happy hour. i havent tried it yet but i plan on being a regular so i'll let you know how that goes :).  definitely the best sushi experience i've had since moving to phoenix. love it!",1
"honestly, i'm not sure what to expect when eating at hooters. so far, so good, thus, the 5 stars.  but, i do have one minor issue with them, but not enough to downgrade them.  eating here is what i imagined the 70's to be about.  wood paneling, that weird color orange, and a little bit of tackiness thrown in for good measure.  so far, when eating here, i have had good experiences.  the girls are nice, the place is clean, and service seems to be prompt and efficient.  i usually can be found here during lunch hour only, and so far, those have been my only experiences.  no happy hour, no dinner, no weekend service.  my only ""complaint"" is that i have carried out a few times from this location.  a handful of times, i felt like i have had terribly slow carry out service. waiting forever for someone to take my order, waiting just as long for food, and feeling ""less important"" then maybe the dine in patrons.",1
"i always have fun here.  i went here on new years this year and had a good time.  i did see the most pathetic lesbian here. she wore her make up and dressed just ike the shane character in the lword.  al i could think was, wow what a loser. and i wish i was that skinny  do you have no personality that you wear a costume everyday.!!  so i was with my girlfriend in line and we were holding each other. she walked away for five seconds and asked my girlfriend for her number. my girlfriend totally dissed her. i walked up and you could see the fear in her eye. she just kept saying  sorry, sorry, sorry.  well anyway aside from that i like this place.  but dont go in the bathroom unless you have to. there are always tranny's doing coke or k in the womens bathroom.  make sure and use a tissue to lock and unlock the stall",1
"disappointed...read how 'great' this place was.  how can you offer meatball subs and not have meatballs, but be told ""we can put marinara on a sandwich if you want""?  visited for the 1st time today...very disappointed: - 1st of all no meatballs - dirty tables and no wait staff cleaning them; had to do it ourselves - really small trash cans jammed to the brim - nasty! - food, napkins on floor - gross - no condiments available (you have to ask) - one napkin holder on the main counter...come on... - some high school kid taking orders/cooking with a wild 'fro and almost no hair netting...nasty ii  the guy that owns this needs to go visit fore father's in tempe to see a clean, well run operation.  fore father's cheesesteaks are delicious compared to this dump.  off my list for good, i am not going back and cannot recommend this place to anyone...",0
"really solid breakfast food, perfect for the morning after a fun night. hearty fare and fresh ingredients, served efficiently with a smile. lots of standard choices, prepared well.  from the moment you walk in the door, it's pleasant, efficient service. the place is huge, so i've never had to wait long and it was great whether there were two or six in my party.",1
"didn't know what to expect. went for lunch. ordered the sampler with the chicken, pork and beef. ordered an order of fish as well, just so i could try as much as possible. macaroni salad on side. it was all very good. healthy? i don't think so, but it did taste good. the place was very clean and everyone was nice.  had to wait a little longer for my order as someone came in and obviously ordered for their office.  not disappointed as so many other places have left me recently.",1
"though we can't be 100% sure, i believe my fiance got food poisoning from the raw oysters he ate here a few weeks ago. we shared all the food that night with the exception of the oysters. he woke up in the middle of the night sick. i originally didn't think too much about it but after a week of still not feeling better, we opted for a trip to the doctor. when explaining the symptoms and the only other food that we both hadn't eaten was the oyster's, he thought that most certainly it could have been the cause since it was the only difference in our diet. after a three day round of antibiotics and another rx for stomach issues, he is feeling better.   i don't know much about seafood (i don't eat anything from the sea) and especially not anything raw so i don't know if it could have been improperly handling or there was just a bad one in the six that he ate. i also don't like reporting something we can't be 100% sure of either but i thought it was worth warning others about. either way, i don't think he'll be back any time for oysters in the future. he did think it was unusual for the oysters coming from the west coast rather than the east when he ordered though so not sure if that is useful either? there was a guy next to us who also had the oysters so it would have been interesting to know if he got sick too.",0
"met up with a friend there for happy hour mid-week and really enjoyed ourselves.  might have been the three bottles of tequila we broke the seal on! strongly urge you to follow our lead on the clase azul, and the jose cuervo reserva! once it hits you lips....soooo good.   needless to say, we outlasted the happy hour.  this is a great little bar in an area that needs something other than the older somewhat rundown versions in the area.  it is small, but it is remodeled in a very group-friendly manner.   only got to try the fried green chillies ( awesome) & the mexican pizza ( (good happy hour munchie), but looking to return soon and sample the menu some more.  if you are looking for a good bar in north phx., you gotta check this place out.",1
"well i have been waiting for dillon's to open at the top of central. there have been several starts and stops there. i got there a few minutes past ""happy hour"" ...gosh darn it, but oh well i definitley had a hankering for bbq. i asked them to bring me a blue moon, waitress apologized for not having a blue moon. how about a stella? absolutely, only to come back minutes later, ""oh, we are out of stella"". i'll take water and the 2 meat platter with french fries (don't let my wife know) and mac and cheese even though i wanted some cole slaw as well.   meal arrived and my first impression, what a skimpy portion of mac and cheese but there were a lot of hand cut fries. fries were served with a hummingbird serving of catsup, asked the waiter, bring me more and he complied. had the beef brisket and st luis style ribs with cajun sauce.   beef, dried out and very little sauce and none on the table. i was afraid to ask for more. ribs were dried out as well with a bit of tangy sauce that i thought was pretty good. all told, i walked spending just under $20 dollars, no beer, not much sauce and pretty disappointed. sorry, not going to be my cue place even though it's in the neighborhood.   i want a cue place with great smoked meats, great sauces and value friendly. not dillons on central.",0
"i would love to say i have had the pleasure of trying this local hot dog restaurant, but unfortunately they have no veggie dogs. the gentleman who took my phone call offered to put all their veggie toppings on a bun for me. while i appreciate the offer it was not what i was in search of. i hope you get some veg friendly options soon, dazzo's!",0
"there are few places that i make a decision to never step foot into again. yasu has earned this dubious distinction from me.   first, let me give you my background with sushi since this came into question from the manager himself. i have been eating sushi for about 11 years. some really bad sushi, some amazing sushi. i have mentioned in previous reviews that i have had sushi fresh off a boat in hawaii. while i don't claim to have had all the sushi in the world, i know what good sushi and what good sushi service is.   second, let me tell you that i have had omakase (chef's menu) in several locales, so i know what it entails.   i was with a group of friends on my highly anticipated visit to yasu sushi bistro. we had made a reservation and were seated immediately. we quickly decided to indulge in the omakase menu. we wanted the best that yasu sushi bistro had to offer! i always say ""hit me with your best shot!""   well... if you have nothing to do, and aren't hungry...you should do the omakase menu. it took thirty minutes between courses. and please don't think we were given platters full of food. this is more like 2 small oysters per person, a plate of 1 shrimp, a couple slices of king claim, a dollop of spanish mackerel tartar on a bone chip.... so think tiny gourmet food. so think how hungry and irritated i was two hours later. in a 3.5 hour visit, we had consumed four tiny dishes. i really tried to be patient, but this is absurd and unacceptable! i finally asked for the check as we wanted to leave and go eat elsewhere. i expressed my displeasure at the slowness of the meal.   now before you yasu lovers roll your eyes and shake your fingers at me. let me put it in perspective. at any restaurant, it is unacceptable to be the first table to arrive, watch subsequent tables seated, and fed, and watch them leave and you're still waiting to be fed... you would be ticked off too. now add to that a condescending manager who comes over to talk to you and asks if you have ever had an omakase experience before and tries to piss in your pocket and tell you that it's raining. unacceptable. now, add to that the restaurant sending out another dish after you had already asked for the check and then charging you for that dish even though you said you didn't want the dish.   i have nothing against the food, though it wasn't very imaginative on the sushi level. what killed the entire visit was the slowness of the courses, the response of the management, and the lack of ethical treatment in regards to the check.   i will never visit yasu sushi again and i bet my stress level will be all the better for it.",0
"i'm glad i read the not-so-great reviews before going here. i was expecting it to be a healthy vegan restaurant. it's definitely not that. the place is cool on the inside, trendy with some interesting decor. you order at the counter and they bring your food out to you. i do have to admit, for a restaurant that calls itself ""green"" i was disappointed to only see styrofoam and plastic cups. booo!  i got the samosas as a starter. they were a little spicy but waaaay too garlicky. i love garlic like no other but the amount they put in there made it taste like fried spicy garlic cloves. no thanks. the dipping sauce was too sweet too. for $4.50 it was a disappointment.  i also got the diablo red with mock chicken and brown rice. the rice was good but everything else was soooooooo salty, oh my god. major turn-off #1. hint- just cuz it has tamari as an ingredient doesn't mean you have to drown the ""meat"" and veggies in it. my friend had the sweet and sour mock chicken. she liked it but the noodles didn't look pan fried at all. that's just ghetto if you ask me. maybe i was seeing things (and that's very possible, don't quote me on it) but they just looked like boiled rice noodles thrown on there.  overall, i've made better vegan food at home. i may give it another try though, get something else and see if it's less salty/garlicky/sweet.",0
"i remember going to cpk years ago (in ny) and enjoying it.  but i must say i was really disappointed.  we ordered a roasted artichoke & spinach pizza, but it was just ok.  maybe i'm just comparing it to picazzo's amazing puttanesca, but this was a fail.   it wasn't nasty, it just wasn't all that...  and we were starving so it should have been delicious.",0
"the revive spa here is amazing. my moh took me here for a massage the day before my wedding and all i can say is ""wow""!   the facilities are beautiful, clean, and well kept. the service is outstanding. our couples massage was fabulous. she had the therapeutic and i the swedish prenatal. i have never been more relaxed in my entire life, and would have stayed on that table forever if i could. i will definitely make this place a regular treat.   the pool is very private, with lots of cabanas and palm trees. the bistro is good. they offer lighter, healthier breakfast and lunch options. it's pricey, and while the food isn't completely spectacular, the smoothies are!   again, i have to reiterate that the service here is perfect and totally accommodating. if you're in need of a day of pampering and relaxation, or you just need to escape the damn heat, escape here!!! you surely will not be disappointed.",1
"this place has a great happy hour! the husband and i went and got arancini, poutine, and a margherita pizza.....i was expecting the happy hour portions to be tiny...they were huge! there were like 8 arancini balls and they were some of the best i have had....crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside, and (best of all) the rice still had some texture like a good risotto should. the balls come on top of some wonderful marinara and a balsamic sauce. the poutine i did not love, but it was a huge portion and was good....just got soggy in areas. the pizza was very good. we also had kronenburg beer for 2$/pint. i will be back!!!",1
"to be totally honest, we went to zona for the live music on the patio.  the drinks were strong and priced a little high, understandably so for a resort though.  the food that was coming out from the kitchen looked incredible!  i love that they have live music on the patio and we will definitely be back for that.",1
"after dropping $100 at the nursery this morning for my new patio, i needed something for breakfast and a nice iced tea.  my neighbors told me about luci's and i've driven by a half dozen times. you can build an omelet there by the size: eeny (just egg), meeny (egg and cheese), miny (egg, cheese and veggies), and moe (all the above with a protein).  i had a piece of spinach quiche.  i also ordered a large iced tea.  well, i was sipping my tea, waiting for the quiche to be heated.  and waited.  finally, after bumping into my massage therapist (she's the best!), i asked about it.  they had forgotten me.  :{  oh well, they offered a free danish to make up for it while they heated up my quiche.   they have a section of teas and different foods.  it's a small section and the prices are a little higher than you'd find at sprouts. i'll be back a million times, since it's so close to home. let's hope they don't forget me next time ;}",1
"update-i really did not want to go here, but my granddaughter and grandson wanted to eat here so i acquiesced.  the food is basically the same as always but some things are less adequate or maybe going downhill a little.  i think is is a cost control issue, especially with the economy still being in the dumps.  they don't serve the deep-fried, sweet-sour rock fish anymore.  i know that this dish is expensive but very good.  and they only serve a little bit of tuna (maguro) sashimi at a time.  in fact, i went back to the sashimi/sushi counter three times during dinner and did not get even one piece.  people wait for them to put out a little bit (like maybe 12 pieces) and they rush to grab it.  i saw one kid take every piece of sashimi from the counter, including the other types as well.  and i saw one family wait until they brought out a new container of snow crab legs and rush up with four dinner plates and take every last piece of crab legs -- i would estimate about 12 pounds worth --- good thing that crab legs is not my thing.  but i must admit that i was thinking that these people must have no class since they act like greedy pigs and i think i could even hear them grunting when they were eating.",0
"this place is solid in every way.  great local brewed beer.  the food is surpisingly good every time.  the menu is huge and they really do everything well from pastas and pizzas which are excellent to their philly, which is equally great (they put a little gravy on it, mmm), and wraps.  fries are darn good.  servers are all nice and like working there. it shows.  good lunch specials.  good happy hour too with half priced appetizers.  i really recommend this place.  solid and semi-local.  can get busy but i always sit at the bar.  ps.  believe it or not i met my wife there a few years ago!  thats why it gets the 5th star.  :)",1
"i really like this place. i have been numerous amt of times and i keep wanting more. the friendly bartenders, the exciting chef  (eddie). the best part of this place besides the good food and comfort level is their all night happy hour. yes all night $5 dollar specialty cocktails like an espresso martini or wines of the day. all first courses (apps) are half off too. the apps includes, lambchops ($19), tuna tartar with wonton chips ($9) and so much more. great s[ot and yearning for more since last night.",1
"i wanted to like this place, i really did. revolving sushi bar where you take plates of what you want and they add them up when you pay your bill? sounds like great fun. except that it wasn't.  in order to pull off this sort of thing you need good sushi. i don't think i had one plate that i actually liked. most of it was almost lukewarm and it definitely didn't taste fresh. heavy sauces, iffy fish, the works. yes, it was inexpensive, but it didn't sit well. the place was also too casual for sushi and too loud for a conversation. we were up near the prep station at the bar, but i would hate to be in the back of the restaurant getting the sushi no one closer to the front wanted. sure, we ate till we were full and the bill was only $30 but i didn't enjoy it. i'd have rather paid a bit more for better sushi and eaten less of it.",0
"being indian and having eaten at many of the best indian restaurants in the valley, i'm not your usual casual diner who knows nothing about indian food. i usually eat dosa and south indian fare at woodlands (ray and rural). i tried cafe krishna for a change. i was disappointed. the service was lousy. the waitstaff was not rude and in fact they were very friendly but the wait was too long. we ordered an appetizer and two dosas. they took a 30 minutes to bring us our appetizer and another 30 minutes (1 hour) before we got our dosa. it was not busy when we ordered. there were only 3 couples in the restaurant at the time and they had 3 waiters. they never checked on us and we had to flag them down to get our bill. one of the waiters is an eastern european woman who spoke no english and had never waited tables before. she brought our chaat to our table and didn't even bring plates with it.  the food itself was good but not noteworthy. their chutneys were not tasty or flavorful. the coconut chutney at woodlands is a lot better. the dosa had very little sabji (potato) filling and was nearly entirely just one large crepe. the dosa at woodlands includes much more sabji. i did like the sabji and thought it was better than woodlands because it was slightly less greasy. the samosa chaat was not good. it had very little samosa (maybe two small pieces of one samosa)  and the rest of it included vegetables. it wasn't bad but neither was it tasty.  the only positive aspect to the place was it's ambience. despite its ""cafe"" name, the place is a sit-down restaurant. it's nicer than many full fledged indian restaurants in the valley. it was clean, spacious with many booths. and decorated well. you are seated, given a menu and a waiter takes your order. it's not like woodlands in which you order at the register. it has a full menu but it's vegetarian. it's also a south indian place so i wouldn't recommend ordering saag paneer and north indian dishes because south indians don't know how to cook north indian food.   i will not come back because the service was too slow. even when we flagged our waiter for our bill, there was another couple who had sat for 15 minutes and had not even had their drink orders taken. honestly, why would i wait an hour to eat dosa when i can go up the street and eat at woodlands and get the same quality dosa in 10 minutes. i'm pretty forgiving of slow service if the restaurant is super busy or if there is only one server but this was different. you could tell the waiters had no previous experience waiting tables and had no sense of urgency. they didn't know how to refill drinks, check up on you, bring your bill to you on time. it seemed like they were related to the owner or were part owners and tried to be servers. if the restaurant improved their speed and service, i would recommend this place. hopefully that will improve",0
"we came here with comp'd coupons about a month after a less than stellar experience at the eggery's sister restaurant the good egg on n. central.  refusing to go back there at the risk of getting the same waitress, we headed up the road to use the coupons.  it was realtively busy. they sat us next to the emergency exit in a renovated add on, enclosed patio type area, it was cramped and uncomfortable, but remained hopeful.  our waitress came through took our drink order we got our drinks quickly and were not ready to order just yet.  mistake!  we then waited, and waited....with no sign of our waitress or any other one for that matter in our area.  we waited...finally about 30 min after being seated a lady who looked more official than a server asked if we had been helped, she must have seen the famished look on our faces and seen we were about ready to walk out.  she then took our order and we recieved it relatively quicky (within like 15 min of taking the order or less).  thankfully we had no where to be in any specific time.  we left full, the food run of the mill.  thankful we had coupons in all the experience was barely worth the tip we left.",0
"buttered buns!    need i say more?  yeah sure, why not.  the regular dogs are a good size but if that's not enough for you, they offer a ""pounder""!  yikes, not for this gal, but maybe for you.  the boston dog comes with mustard, relish and onions, which is a good combo in my book.  but then they put the grilled dog and all those condiments in a buttery toasted bun.  now that's just yummy.  seriously.  i read another person's review that said the french-fires were too greasy and i must correct that - they are in no way greasy - they were perfect in every way.  yes to the fries.",1
"ryan's is a great place to buy pet supplies. i like the fact that it is set up like a warehouse. no sales people bugging me when i just want to look. there are people there to help you find stuff when you need them. they also carry heavy items to the front for you. i would give it 5 stars, but it's too far from where i live to be convenient. i wish there was another location further north!",1
"i really want to like this place, i really... really do.  but after going here four times in the last year-ish and having the same experience every time, i am compelled to write:  the food is always pretty good, not great but it can be surprisingly very good at times.  i hope you're not hungry when you dine at this romano's macaroni grill, because you'll get seated, and then you'll watch your server walk past your table 3 or 4 times without even looking at you. then maybe they will stop by and take your drink order.  they will bring you their usual bread, in an effort to make nice and to think you will forget that they made you wait for your drink....   then they will repeat the same routine, walking past your table, but this time, about 5 or 6 times, even though your drinks are empty and your menus closed on the end of the table.   finally, they will take your order ~ spaghetti & meatballs and chicken parmigiana please...   they will stop by 2 to 3 times as you wait to let you know that your food will be out in just a minute or two.     45 minutes after you ordered, your food will arrive to your table with out an apology about the long wait, and they will try to tell you ""the kitchen got soooo backed up.""  seriously???  we can see the kitchen from our table dude... come on...  not to mention it's a tuesday night with the dining room is half empty?  but maybe it takes romano's 45 minutes to boil noodles and fry a chicken cutlet?  anyway, i really want to like this place, because the food can be really good, and the restaurant is in a nice location.  but i don't think we'll be going back anytime soon after having the exact same experience four times.    btw ~ we don't care for the new way your serving water by using tap water to fill a pitcher, then to be carried over to fill a container located on the center tables only to fill yet another vessel, a bottle then bring it to us as if it's bottled h2o along with two small glasses.  seriously?",0
"thankfully i'm not one of those individuals that are effected by the addition of msg. therefore i can enjoy my periodic visit to china chili with no adverse reactions.   quite a bit has already been covered on the expansive room, so i won't dive in to that. and most of my favorite dishes have already been covered in other's reviews so here are the ones that stand out in my mind (that haven't already been described at great length): * chicken corn chowder - one of my favorite ""i'm sick"" meals. think egg flower with minced chicken and corn. * honey walnut prawns - not quite as good as big wongs, but damn good! * pillow chicken - minced chicken with a bunch of other crunchy good things, fried up mouth-sized dumpling style and blanketed in black pepper sauce -  yummo!  *sichuan style green beans - the menu version is made with pork, but i have them make it vegetarian with extra spice and it is to die for.  i've never actually experienced the ""frozen vegetables"" that others have suffered, so i have to think that this is more anomaly than practice. they are always willing to alter dishes to my liking (more spice, no meat, different meat, etc.) - this is a huge plus in my book because i love spicy chinese. the staff is stevia sweet - meaning they are all naturally friendly! and drum role please.... i can call in my order, hop in the car, pick up my food, and get my chopsticks on in front of my own tv within 15 minutes! love it!!",1

"i went to daphne's today since i love their patio and wanted to leisurely dine outdoors. i ordered the chicken ka-bob and the double greek salad and a soft drink for $7.94 today. i love greek salad, but this came nowhere near to my expectations. i am used to a ton of tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, etc. i had two small tomatoes and cucumber slices and two or three olives and a lot of lettuce. i'm used to a greek salad having little if any lettuce. i guess i am spoiled by all the great greek restaurants in chicago. time to get busy and find a go to greek restaurant in this area.",0
"excellent job at doing what they do.  don't think i've had better crème brûlée anywhere in the valley.  ( maybe the farm kitchen at south mountain's butternut squash crème brûlée would give them a run for the money. )  anyway, i drove about 15 miles to get this food, and i bought 4 flavors - chocolate, vanilla, lavender, and pumpkin.  all were drool-worthy.  i'll be back to this truck...somewhere...sometime...:)",1
"i don't know why people hype this place so much.  the bread is usually stale.   just because they blantently propagandize herb doesn't make it good.  subway is just as legit.   plus it's a bit dirty.  what do you expect from an entirely baked work force.  if you find yourself in the vicinity of cheba hut, go to the pasty.",0
"lo-lo`s:you had me at chicken and waffles!! a first for me trying this and damn i`m gonna be back for more!! hardest part here was deciding what to order but i went with what i came for- lo-lo`s ( 3 pc fried chicken and waffles). juicy and crisp,heaven to my tummy!!  also tried the red kool aid drank! yum!!  like i said i plan to be back to try more delicousness  here, especially the red velvet cake!",1
"my meal here was just ok.  there were a few people in line in front of us, but we waited almost 15 minutes to place our order.  not sure why it took so long.  at least our food was quickly brought to our table.  there's only one vegetarian option on the menu, which is not ideal.  it was ok, but it seemed like there were an awful lot of bean sprouts in it and not as many noodles as i would have liked.  i quickly finished the noodles and was left with a bowl full of broth and sprouts.  there were just a few small slices of tofu...disappointing for sure.  we also ordered a smoothie, and we waited about 25 minutes for it, longer than it took us to finish our meal.  we ended up taking it with us.  they said it took so long because it took a long time to make the boba, but we ordered ours without boba, and i guess it didn't occur to them to make ours first since they could do it right away.  the restaurant was clean and the food was pretty good, but overall not a satisfying experience.  i'll probably try it again when they've had longer to get their act together.",0
"a couple sunday morning brunch's here, and i am sold.  other than it's location, i can't say good enough things about it!  the drinks are awesome, the food is fabulous, and the staff is on top of their game.  i've had a few things on the menu, and i've been completely satisfied with each one of them.  my girlfriends that i have gone with rave about the omelets, if you are into the ""egg"" thing. :)  really though, great place, sit on the patio if you can.",1
"some might walk into freddy's and think.. ""hey this is like culvers..""   sure, they both sell burgers and custard, but i tell ya what..  freddy's burgers are far tastier and the custard is out of this world.  how's that for an 80s commercial?  i got a bacon cheeseburger with fries.  i had no idea their fries were shoestring, but i loved them even more.  you can get carried away with fries and end up stuffing yourself.  these work just right.  i added some of their special seasoning on top and went to town.   only bad thing was when i have a good burger, i can usually inhale the thing in about a minute.. the burger was gone in about 90 seconds.  sorry! it was good!!   my girlfriend leaned over and said to me after i ate it.. ""really??""  i know..  sue me. it was good.  if i had to compare it to anything, id say smashburger.  which i also love.    for dessert i had a great medley of custard, caramel, chocolate and pecans.. mmmmm.. super good.",1
"i'm not even going to waste my time with an in depth review of this place.  the menu is generic and the food mostly repulsive - guac dip, monaco ""focaccia"" (nothing focaccia about it, it was flat bread plain and simple), even the onion rings and fries were gnarly (and i'm irish and must eat potatoes with every meal).  the clientele was immature, obnoxious, and way too drunk for 4:30 on a friday (i'm talking connecting several straws together and walking around to other tables to drink from their beers through the extendo-straw. . .oh, and taking pictures of each other's ass cracks).  the service was miserable (i must have said ""no ranch dressing"" about 10x and still somehow wound up with it, and our waitress seemed unable to deal with the four tables in her section nor had any clue what the marinated chicken was marinated in).  and for a sports bar, my husband and i were literally the only ones in the place interested in any of the games they were showing (though people were cheering ""suck, suck"" for the aforementioned extendo-straw chick).  the only possibly redeeming thing about this place is that it is ridiculously cheap for happy hour and their nightly specials.  but you get what you pay for.",0
"order in, drive through this place is the go to in arcadia for a great burger (ok i didn't mean to make that rhyme).  they ""get"" great customer service and always ask for my name when i order even in the drive through.  i haven't had a chance to try a shake yet mostly because i save my calories for a standard with cheese and fries.  they are also always happy to modify my burger as i am not a lettuce, tomato, onion fan.  only gripe is they use a lot of pepper on both the burger and on the fries.  i like well seasoned but the beef is amazing and flavorful so no need to add anything else.  same with the fries, salt is all you need!",1
"i wish i could love this place, but i don't. it's not a lounge, it's not a nightclub and it's barely a restaurant (the menu is sparse).   the venue: it's situated right downtown and sadly most of these venues have to survive off the ""downtown tourists"" from the suburbs. my guess is that this place is aimed to give those (middle aged) people a sense of ""the big city"" and that it does. it strives to have a mature hip feel, the dinning room employs the newly popular community seating (i.e. you could find yourself sharing a bench/table with the couple right next to you), and they have a dj playing trance music while you dine. they succeed in that regard. this does have an old skewl slightly upscale ""metro"" feel to it.  the food:  a very sparse menu, i had the carne pizza which had great thin crust but lacked much flavor.  the service: the service staff is where they really fail. you can go to places like fez, cibo, or pallete and it's instantaneously clear that you are being served by professionals. not so much here, quite the opposite actually. our service was what i expect from a breakfast dinner or the waffle house (the waitress was far to casual for a place like this, i.e. it was kinda a like ""so watcha want?"" kinda thing going on). and honestly, with the current unemployment rate, as well as the location and style of this place, it's completely unacceptable to me.  so if your looking for poor service in downtown now you have three choices: carly's, breadfruit and now hanny's  all-in-all ... i'd say that this place is yet another venue that regretfully caters to the occasional downtown tourist and adds very little to the sustainability of a real downtown (that phoenix so lacks). it gets a ""meh"".",0
"went here for opening night and considering that one simple fact... couldn't have gone any smoother.  we opened with the goat cheese/ herb pesto appetizer, went down very well with our petite table of 2.  for the entree, definitely have the steak, i rarely do, but very glad that i did.  she decided to have the seafood stew (the only reason for the 4 stars) and wanted more substance.  yes, it was great, but it needed to have more mussels, or shrimp or clams, just more to it.  we had the the paltz & hall, pinot noir (recommended by ryan) - an excellent choice from the small but delectable menu.    overall, imagine postino & radiomilano with a hint of la cool...  great location, staff was on it and there were many patrons just there to have a libation (love to use this word).  i will return!    (there will be a great patio soon, but there no chairs/tables and who wants sit outside without misters?)",1
"after having dined here before & given it 4 stars, i raved it up to norm r., robyn n. & mike c. who joined me for lunch here today.  well, this place was a disappointment today.  each of us ordered the same thing, the ""mixed grill"", a platter that was supposed to come with gyros, chicken kabab, kafta kabab, rice, babaganoush, hummus, and pita bread.  *  after a little while our platters showed up, missing the gyros!     :-(  *  after some back and forth, we were served the two strips each of gyros, but it was very greasy.  we shouldn't have had to ask for it either, let alone beg!     :-(  *  i tried to order a bowl of their renouned lentil soup, but they didn't have any.     :-(  *  on top of everything else, this plate was expensive, at $12.49.     :-|  ugh.  i doubt i'll be returning to this one, especially since we have excellent alternatives such as al-hana.     :-)",0
"the bulk items here are really the only consistently priced items in the entire store. they do have some occasional good deals.... for example.... milk right now is only 1.57..... but other than those occasional sale items there are really no good deals here. i highly recommend going late at night.....otherwise you will have to wait in very long lines....and the prices are not worth it. one other important note here...if you shop with a credit card.....don't bring it here....they don't except them. eat, drink, and be merry my friends....but do your grocery shopping somewhere else!!!!",0
"while this place can be very lively and entertaining and it has a great neighborhood/dive vibe going on, it almost always dissappoints me. i want so badly to like this place and make it my home away from casey's however they do their best to make it hard. hard on the atmosphere: 9 times outta ten its dead, no one there and nothing going on hard on the wallet: when something is actually happenin like some live music or just a good crowd there is always a cover, and they seem to jack up their prices hard on the pallet: no good beer selections. have fun sipping on piss tasting domestics overall i seem to just get alienated from this bar, despite its potential. in my opinion they should shape up or sail out",0
"in-n-out was introduced to me by some socal fanatics - who ""schooled me"" to order from the ""secret menu"" (available on their website) like a pro. so a 3x3 was my first experience. i've since decided a double-double is the right size for me.  the food here is the freshest fast food burger shop faire you'll get. the staff (yes, youngsters) is always extremely cheerful, friendly and patient.  if you need a burger and like the thin cut style fries, this beats the heck out of the golden arches less than a block away (or other national chains).",1
"they do a good job for a full service car wash but i hate all the upselling. i don't really care that you will sell me a full-on detailing for half the normal price because at $150 that's not all that much different than what i could pay elsewhere.   once in a while i'm willing to come in and spend $20+ for a full service wash that not only gets the exterior, but also includes vacuuming and cleaning of the interior. but with all the high pressure sales i'm always reminded why i prefer to go to the self-serve places that only cost me between $5-7.  i'll probably be back at some point, but definitely not on a regular basis.. and sorry dude, i'm not spending that much to have my car detailed.",0
"the best i can say is there are lower prices on many items compared to other grocery stores in the area and there are also convenient portions of deli items.  what i don't like?  store seemed unorganized, food is in different sections through out, with household items in the middle. bag your own groceries. it was a large shopping trip, i wasn't aware of the policy, and i was getting stared down for taking so long by other customers. eeek!! lacking in customer service- didn't see anyone to ask a question to. crowded. long checkout lines. many brands i've never seen elsewhere and i do go to many other discount stores.  i don't plan on going back. it would be less frustration to just go to a store that matches prices.",0
"one of my favorite things to do is go out to eat.  i had been eyeing this place's menu online for sometime. it sounded delicious and gourmet and i couldn't wait to try it.   the restaurant it self is totally cute and cozy like a place you'd take your mom.  however it did not live up to my expectations whatsoever.   first we were served some cold eggbread rolls with rock hard butter, not worth eating at all!  you can tell alot about a place by the bread and butter they serve.   next she brings out our meals, she gives me the strawberry salad, it was not what i ordered but it did look good, so after waiting awhile she brings me what i did order, the wild mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart ....all i can say is blah! not very good or gourmet so i was looking forward to the sandwich my daughter ordered: california club it said it came on rosemary focaccia which i love, but this bread was so thick, dry and flavorless,just plain gross and very skimpy on the filling for the sandwich too.   we had been drooling over their pastry platter the whole time thinking a lemon cake cookie would end the meal on a good note...it tasted like a week old pancake with a little lemon icing on it.  i was very disappointed, i will not go back and waste my money.  this place is perfect for old drunk loud women, cause that's what it was full of while we were there.  the one star is for the being a cute place to look at, but i wouldn't eat there again.",0
"we went there on a saturday night, and it was swamped.  we waited a little while, but did get seated in a reasonable amount of time.    talk about overpriced and not very good.  we both got the spaghetti and there was hardly any sauce on it, so we asked for a side dish, and the size of the side dish of sauce (for both of us) was laughable.  it had a decent taste, that's why there's two stars instead of one.  i had to ask again for more sauce, and they brought us another little tiny dish of sauce.   and we also sat there for a good long time with empty soda glasses.  i would never go back to this place.",0
"this place has been my favorite on on every tuesday, and i have never had any problems at all until last tuesday!  there were 3 of us went to the restaurant together, and we were told that we had to wait at least 45mins for the next table available. ok fine, we guess we just needed to hang around until we were called.  however, 30mins came by and we came in and check - there were several booths and tables were available. the hostess refused to sit us because the kitchen was busy and there were not a lot of servers. she asked us to wait another one hour!  one hour? i mean really?  it was freaking 9pm and we were starving! all of us were pissed, left the place and went to kona grill which had so much better options....  they need to do something about it - i mean tuesday is wings night and they expected it not to be busy? heck no!",0
"i chose to start rock climbing at this gym because its close to work.  the first timers training was very informative, i received all the info i hoped i would and even made some friends along the way.  this gym is awesome.  the rentals fees are low, the gear is in good shape and the staff is super friendly and eager to help out without making you feel like a dummy for asking.    one thing i find terribly funny is that you can get a lifetime membership for only a million dollars, i can't decide if this is a joke or a typo but it makes me laugh all of the time.",1
"bison bacon, japanese octopus, duck, sirloin in truffle oil.... i had all of these things and many more during my first meal at posh.  wow!!   i love trying new things, and this definitely hit the mark!  i truly enjoyed myself at posh.  it's not just a meal, it's an experience.  this restaurant has such a unique concept and they deliver with an amazing quality of food.  we did the 5 course meal.  this is the smallest option, and it's pricey, but the portions are all appropriate so we walked out fully satisfied but not over stuffed.     we sat at the bar, which surrounds the open kitchen.  you get to see the chef's at work, which is pretty cool.   for the foodies out there, this is a true delight!   it's interactive, the staff were all very attentive, friendly and helpful.  one of the chefs even noticed my friend hadn't eaten part of his dish and offered to replace it with something else if he didn't like it.   to give you an idea what to expect - you will get to choose how many courses you want and if you want wine pairings with your meals.  then you get a list of their proteins, which are all pretty unique!  you can cross off anything you are not willing to try.  i crossed off frog legs and escargot, but everything else was fair game.   some things on the list...octopus, fluke, bison, sirloin, crab, etc.  you pick how you typically like your meat prepared and then can leave some special instructions - no mushrooms, light sugar, etc.  otherwise, that's it - from there it is the chef's choice on what they will make for you.   i can't even pretend to tell you all of the food that we had, because i have no idea, but i'll give you a little overview.  the first course was an amuse bouche of shaved radishes, cheese and a little sauce.  i don't even like radishes, but man this was delish!   the next dish was a soup course.  omg, heaven in my mouth!  after all, it did have bacon in it. mmm!!   following the heavenly soup, i had japanese octopus.  i was a little nervous, but it was so good! then, i had a sirloin dish with truffle oil....ahhhh!!!   next came the duck. everything was so beautifully prepared  too, you almost didn't want to eat it - it looked so perfect.  then on to dessert - strawberries and an orange sorbet of some sort.  perfect! even got a little to go package with another little dessert.     another cool thing was that none of the meals my date and i had were the same.   so i got to try all of his food too.   he had the bison bacon - wow! yes, please!   he also had scallops, which were cooked perfectly.  i can't remember everything else, but there was a tapioca spinach, cilantro jelly and his dessert was a sinfully delectable chocolate dish.  this place is great for a special occasion, a romantic date night, a nice work dinner, a girls night out, birthday party....or just dinner on a tuesday night, which was our occasion!  it's a bit pricey, but in my opinion it was totally worth it!     enjoy!",1
"so i decided to return and give it a second chance. my food didn't blow me out of the water the first time i went, but was pretty good and i've been having some serious cravings for carne asada lately.  i went with the torta de carna asada and holey mexican sandwich batman!!! the absolute best torta i've ever had!! the bread was super soft and flaky, had the carne asada (which was much better this time..and two days later when i went again...sssh don't tell my wife) guacamole and i think onions.  overall, that's the item i'll go back for....probably more than my wife and doctor would sanction....but i won't tell if you don't tell.....",1
"we've been eagerly anticipating the opening of pastabar since we heard of it, and we love the location near sens, breadfruit and now turf accountant.  let's start out by saying we are huge fans of hand made fresh pasta.  but read on...  we showed up about 7pm on a thursday and were the only patrons in the place...another group showed up when we were finishing.  the decor is nice, i like it.  the servers were very friendly and attentive.  the bar / wine list was not yet available, but we went in expecting this as we knew about the license pending.  let's talk about the food and presentation.  starters: there were plastic packaged crunchy breadsticks on our plates - ok, tasty enough.  it would be nicer if the kitchen sent out something small and hand made instead.  we tried the fritto misto, a deep fried appetizer trio: stuffed/deep fried olives:  tasty and interesting, not a bad start.  the broccollini was not as good, a bit greasy, but still interesting.  the deep fried risotto was probably the best thing they have, i really enjoyed it.  all were served on a plain white plate.    pastas:   we were told the portions were small, 4-6oz, so we decided to order and share 3 pastas and get a few tastes for the evening.   all were served in plain white bowls (which is fine), but as a whole they all just had too many flavors that overwhelmed the pasta, especially any with the hot peppers.  the gianciale was interesting as a bacon in the pasta, but all around, the pastas tasted heavy, possibly over-egged, too garlicky, and one even had bread mixed in with the sauce...very odd.    the gnocchi was way too spicy, the gnocchi itself was actually nicely made, but the sauce completely blanketed any flavors the pasta might have had.  you wouldn't know it was gnocchi other than the texture and shape.  aren't you here for the sauce and the pasta?  why take so much time to lovingly hand prepare a pasta if you are going to kill it with a poorly made sauce?  we did not finish but a portion of each bowl, it wasn't interesting or good enough.   we eat italian several times a week and even though in most cases our favorite italian restaurant (marcellino ristorante) costs more, the quality, flavors, presentation and service are far better than the food and service here.  a $19 pacatelli al ragu di salsiccia at marcellino completely blows away a $17 anything here.  there is no comparison.    this place hasn't mastered pasta yet, unfortunately....and this is the chef from sassi i believe...maybe we were there on a bad night?  but three strikeouts in three pastas...just doesn't cut it.  it wasn't good enough, it was way too overwrought.  desert: skipped, they only offered italian ice.  i think the chef is trying to be too creative here.  either that or i am used to more subtelty, higher quality, or even more mastery in the making of pastas and the pairing of hand made sauces.    both of us agreed that we probably wouldn't come back, even though we always like to give a restaurant more than one chance.  it just didn't show any kind of mastery of italian food at all.  just too many conflicting flavors that did nothing for the pasta.    on the way out we stopped at sens and were nicely received by johnny chu and we had a nice bottle of sake as our dessert.  we were so impressed by their menu and cold sake selection that we went back the next night and had some of the best asian fusion we've had!  (review pending).   mmm, yakitori shrimp with head on.  crunchy goodness!  summary: if you are in the neigborhood, you have better options for a nice dinner for a better price.  sens, cheuvront, breadfruit..  but if you want italian food...this isn't the place.  but give them a try, my review is my own.  my palate is different and i'm sure many people will love this place, it might be a match for you.  i do wish them success.  this is a tough economy and maybe all that is needed is a few tweaks to the sauces - a little more subtlety and fewer ingredients that work well together might make this place worth revisiting.",0
"we decided to eat here last week since we had only been the one time and wanted to try them again. ugh, it wasn't good. we ordered a couple dishes to-go and it was completely over priced for what we got and the food was flavorless! i was so disappointed since when we first tried babbo's we had a great experience. we probably won't be back. we'll just stick to oregano's or rigatony's since we always have a good time at those restaurants.",0
"meh.  if anyone asked me what i thought of citizen public house in old town scottsdale, that would be my reaction.  the ambiance was meh. the food was meh. and the sangria was meh.  in fact, the highlight of my meal was when one of the cute bartenders (at least they have that going for them) delivered our drinks instead of our server.  the interior is bare bones and plain. the white walls are covered with a smattering of vintage photographs you'd have to squint to see-from a table not by a wall, the atmosphere isn't artsy, it just looks like bad decorating in someone's living room. i didn't really understand why butcher paper covered the white tablecloth-covered tables, since that sort of took whatever class the spot had and negated it. the seating wasn't comfy, and even though there was a patio, it was tiny and overlooked a parking lot.  there weren't many vegetarian menu options on the small american menu, so i opted for a grilled cheese ($12). my gut told me to leave off the peruvian sweety relish, a weird red mixture, but i kept it on because i figured it had to contribute to the sandwich somehow. i was wrong. it tasted gross, and i ended up scraping it all off and wishing remnants weren't still stuck to the sandwich. i got it with a non-noteworthy salad, and i've had much, much better artisan grilled cheeses that were less expensive and more filling.  my friend said she liked her chopped salad, the same one i've had at cowboy ciao (it's a creation of citizen public house chef/owner bernie kantak, who used to cook at cowboy ciao.) i also liked it there, but it's so tiny, i can't justify paying $12 for it-especially since i'd leave the meat off.  like i said, the sangria failed to leave a big impression on me, other than that it wasn't strong. for $9 a glass, i expected something with a little more kick to it but was left disappointed.  i can't think of any reason i'd tell someone to go to citizen public house. if the atmosphere had been a little prettier or livelier, maybe it'd be a fun destination, but the company i had was the only thing that kept it from boring me.",0
"after being a valley resident my whole life, i finally made it to cibo. it's been on my list of restaurants for a while, but the other times i've tried to try their pizza, they've been way to crowded and the wait was super long so we bailed.   we managed to get seated right away on a friday night right around 7, but only because it wasn't first friday or 3rd friday. so if this is on your list of restaurants to try, i would definitely recommend going on an ""off day"" that doesn't draw huge crowds.   i was overwhelmed with the choices of food that cibo's menu had to offer, but finally decided on sharing two pizzas: the margherita and the tartufata (mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and a drizzle of white truffle oil). we always try a pizza joint's margherita pizza to use as a baseline to properly compare with other pizza places. both pizzas came out of the oven super quick, and didn't fail to impress our taste buds. loved the fluffy nature of the crust, and the cheese was perfectly melted. both paired nicely with pillsbury wild child white wine.  the only reason i didn't give them 5 stars is because i think the best pizza joint in arizona is pizzicletta in flagstaff, and in my opinion, cibo doesn't beat it. however, they still make an exquisite pizza that i would be happy to gobble down any day.",1
"went to charr's last night for restaurant week. it was busy, good saturday night vibe. owner (joe) was circulating and jovial. though they are on the pricey side on their regular menu, the restaurant week deal was generous. a large and very strong cocktail, the charrismo (their take on a cosmopolitan). quite good. appetizers, i had crab cakes, gf had wings after asking to make sure they weren't too spicy. they were about a 5 on a scale of 10 spiciness, too much for her. waitress offered to exchange 'em, but we simply swapped. i thought they were great. fries with orders, i had salmon burger (great), gf had portobello burger (phenomenal). i had a beer flight, she had a glass of chardonnay. then we still had desserts, but were full so we'll get to those tonight. really a great deal for 30 bucks per. i'll be back, probably for happy hour because they are a bit pricey on the regular menu.....",1
"i bought a coupon for this place before i checked the ratings.  tried it on friday because there is  ""flamenco"" show.  at about 7:35pm, a guitarist takes his place on a chair and begins to strum.  hmmm,  not bad i thought.  then a woman with dancing shoes emerges wearing a frilly, nylon, pink dress which could have easily been a nightgown.  (not trying to be mean, just telling the truth).  she did two dances and during the rest of her time, she sat down and  clapped along while the guitarist played.   when i presented the coupon, the waiter told me that i had to order two entrees.  having read from other yelpers that they had been told the same, i quickly corrected the waiter and told him that the coupon said, $40 worth of food not necessarily entrees.  they acquiesced. they served us hot rolls, no butter.  instead, a garlicky ranch type dressing.  i put up with it.  cost saving measure i guess.  my friend ordered the chicken al jerez, a chicken cutlet in sherry sauce.  he didn't want rice so he got vegetables.  on the menu in the restaurant, it doesn't specify that dishes come with soup or salad as it does on the internet.  i told the waiter and he added a salad. the chicken was overdone, but the taste of the sauce was good.  mushrooms on the chicken were out of a can.  salad was fresh  i had two appetizers.  empanadas & shrimp wrapped in bacon.  empanadas should be meat filled turnovers.  not here.  it was made with pizza dough stuffed with tomato sauce and slivers of chicken so small that i had to closely check it to be sure what it was.  i set it aside because it was not worth eating.  the waiter saw this and offered to get me another appetizer.  nice guy.  ordered tortilla espanola, a traditional fritata containing sliced potatoes, in its place.  it was good.  you can't hurt a frittata. just dump stuff in the eggs and you're done.  i enjoyed the shrimp and bacon appetizer (i think trader joe's sells these frozen)  until i awoke last night with heartburn.  i remember eating them and thinking that the bacon was not totally crisped up (needed more time in the oven).  my fault for not telling them.   the saving grace of this evening was the server who waited on us and really tried to please us.  the one star is for him.  the owner who had greeted us initially at the door was busy setting tables with tablecloths (another cost-cutting measure?) instead of checking in on his patrons.  i for one do not recommend this place to anyone.",0
"i donno if i just didn't go in on a good day, but eh. we had ordered sichuan beef and general chicken...it tasted exactly the same. salty and not spicy at all. fried wontons i couldn't even chew.  the lettuce wraps were ok...little bland. only good thing that we ate all of was the hot and sour soup. everything else we sadly threw away.",0
"the array of seafood they offer here for the price is truly impressive. you can sample sushi and sashimi to mussels and crab legs. they always feature salmon and sometimes even have crawfish! there's a whole lot to pick from and usually the price is around $20 per person. it's hard to beat the value you get for your hard-earned seafood-snarfin' dollar here!  a couple of things i noticed in the few times i've done the buffet thing here. if you arrive late, the pickin's will be slimmer. there will be some items that you know have sat in the chafing dish that aren't as palatable-looking as they were when first deployed. you have to act fast when the batches of crab legs are put out, since everyone and their mom seems to belly up for another round of these pronto! i also steer clear of a lot of the sushi past 9 p.m. it always looks a little dried-out and curious to me, not something i'm willing to take too much of a chance on.  however, i feel the dining experience here is pleasant. the staff are friendly and helpful. and there is a ton of good seafood to keep you satisfied. there are even things that i'm a little unsure of how to eat, like sea snails or something i couldn't quite recognize. this place is densely frequented by the east valley asian community, which to me says this is the place to find reasonably-priced good seafood. beware though...the competition is fierce for those fresh batches of crab legs! you may have to use your crab cracker to defend your rightly-deserved, hard-fought-and-won portion!",1
"i've been to several conveyor belt sushi type places, and i understand that sushi that travels around on the conveyor belt is not meant to be the ""elite of the elite"" sushi. i've been to some pretty fancy sushi restaurants to true ""authentic ones"" to aj's grocery store type sushi places, i am really not picky!  i appreciate the finesse of what sushi restaurants can come up with.  here, although the service was great. the rice was pretty hard on the rolls. the fish just came out really dry. i really wanted to like this place and my husband and i brought my dad here on a  sunday, and my dad was so disappointed with the sushi, he almost made a scene! i quickly ate a few rolls that i got off the conveyor belt and quickly had my husband get my dad out of there to another sushi place nearby where my dad could order his favorite ""masago roll topped with quail egg sushi."" i explained to him that this sushi place didn't have rolls like that there. they have their own specialty rolls there. however, i couldn't help the fact that my nigiri - mackerel sushi or was it snapper? but anyway, it was dry and chewy. the restaurant just opened that morning and the fish already seemed dry!   i might give this place another chance, especially without my dad, the sushi snob. i just like having this gimmicky type of conveyor belt sushi as an option on this side of town.",0
"great happy hour! be sure to arrive before 6pm to take advantage of their awesome ""island time"" menu (aka happy hour), even available on saturday. our foursome enjoyed cocktails: grapefruit basil martini, mojito and margaritas. everyone was happy. there are great apps on the hh menu too -- the ahi tuna poke is great, and my husband liked the fish tacos. my gluten free friend had a hard time, however. she settled on a salad, but the gf entree options were disappointing. everyone enjoyed his or her meal. great ambiance!",1
"my review hasn't changed for the new place also. we got excited that they had moved to the new location and maybe had overhauled their offerings etc.   although pierre was a delight and very attentive when we were there, the products except for the chocolate croissants were lack luster. the pastries were dry and looked like they had been sitting in an improperly refrigerated box for who knows how long. the place itself has a very odd smell inside. almost like a hint of gutters. this was on a saturday afternoon.   i didn't realized how much the pastries and croissants had cost us until we went out to the car.   go to essence bakery instead.",0
"i have been racking my brain to think of nice things to say about morton's:  * they plastic wrap they use on the ""selection tray"" is very shiny:)  * they have single malt scotch:)  * the lighting is very low if you have light sensitivity problems:)  * the steaks are better than the steaks at lonestar or outback or the buffet at eagles nest in the casino:)  i want to say something nice, because that's how i was raised.  but i'm having trouble.  was the food really bad?...well, no it wasn't a horror show...although medium rare isn't that hard to achieve...i shouldn't have to put up with an over cooked steak (i don't like to send food back when dining with clients...doesn't send the right message)  was the service inept or ill-mannered?...not really, although being asked if everything is ""to my liking"" after every third bite can become cloying (i suppose it's in the manual somewhere:)  was the bill really that bad?...well, my prospective clients actually took me to dinner, so i didn't pay, but i did see the bill...$460 for the three of us, so not as much as some but for that kind of dough i do expect a better meal:)  morton's seem to have become the mcdonald's of steakhouses (as contrasted with ruth's chris...the burger king of steakhouses:)  they are safe...  you won't get the wildly uneven results that you'll find with say...a mastro's location:)  you always know where the toilet is:)...and the bar:)...and the coat room:)...and etc.:)  you always know where the rib-eye is located on the ""selection tray"":)  but the preparation of the food is pedestrian, the presentation is uninspired, the sides are uninspiring and the whole feel is formulaic and dated:(  i do expect more at this price point and morton's just doesn't deliver these days:(  so, just like mickied's, i only go to morton's these days, when i am dragged (or is it ""drugged"":)  are there worse dining experiences?...oh you bet...we could still be dealing with the pink taco:)",0

"fifth & wine is a nice wine bar in old town. the staff was great, very helpful. in fact, they sat down with us repeatedly throughout our visit to check on us, tell us a little bit about the place and the menu.   the bruschetta is delicious, inventive and reasonably priced. they only have one sauvignon blanc, but the one they have is pretty good. lots of cozy couch seating in addition to the bar and table set-ups. great happy hour. check it.",1
"ulgh. we knew better. but we had a gift card. how can you resist $25 off your meal, right?  it was a saturday night, peak dinner time. the place was packed. well, it must not have been *too* full, as we were immediately seated. but it certainly felt jammed. that was probably due to the fact that they crammed about 500 tables in the space the size of a starbucks. to boot, those table were stocked with crying babies. lots of crying babies.  i felt kind of bad for our server, who was a big girl. she could barely get through the back to back chairs in order to reach our table. however, during the course of dinner, my sympathy waned, as i realized she sucked as a server. i can't stand having to look at empty dirty plates, and we had to do that a lot. i was also thirsty a lot.   now the food... wow, the food. ok, it started well enough, kind of. first, we got a really yummy loaf of rosemary-laced bread, served with evoo and cracked pepper. that's it. no balsamic or herbs or salt. that would've been fine, if they olive oil was fantastic. but it wasn't.  the blah oil set the tone for the rest of the meal. blah, blah, blah. the only flavor in any dish, was a hint of butter. everything was dreadfully underseasoned. my lobster ravioli primarily tasted of the spinach pasta that surrounded it. it could've really used some garlic, salt, and some herbs.   the whole meal was completely underwhelming, and i was resentful for having spent *any* money on it. damn you, gift card.",0
"unfortunately, i have to update my review for babbo after a negative experience.  seeing as how i don't make it up in that direction much, and i had to go up there today to run an errand, i was very excited about stopping at babbo to pick up a salad for lunch.  i eagerly went to their website, picked out my perfect salad -- the chicken chopped salad, which is new to their menu -- and placed my order.  i stopped by to pick up my salad, paid and came back to work.  to my dismay, once i opened up my salad, i noticed there were things in the salad that i didn't know came in the salad and that i don't eat -- like black olives and mushrooms.  hmmm, i thought, did i make a mistake and order the wrong salad?  so i went back to their website only to learn that they actually gave me the wrong salad!  seriously????  i called the restaurant and the guy who helped me while i was there had already figured out his error and was apologetic for it.  he offered me a free salad the next time i come in, which is fine, even though i don't go there often.  however, considering he had my phone number from my online order, he could've at least tried to call me before i got all the way back to my office.  i had my mouth all ready for a good chopped salad and instead was given some crap i couldn't enjoy.  although i was able to pick out most of the mushrooms, the salad i received was basically inedible for me, because there were so many black olives in it that it was hard to try to pick them all out.    i'm so disappointed.",0
"very nice interior. i love the bar with oyster shooters and the deli and lobster tank!  i'm aware of what fish have the highest mercury, which are substituted and which are lying low on the overfished list. i know what water areas are most polluted and which are not.   i want to know the country of origin my fish is from and whether it is wild caught, sustainable or farmed. when i'm paying for something with my own money i make informative decisions and want to know exactly what i'm getting.     they serve the exact fish that they have on the menu--no substitutes. i think that the majority of consumers aren't aware that restaurants and grocery stores can serve fill-ins or substitutes for the actual fish and essentially lie about what they are serving. yeah thanks to our lazy and corrupt usda.   excellent service from our male waiter--the best i've ever had!",1
"squish squish so you can eat a dish. how crazy is that? they even provide wax paper just for squishing down your food to crush as much as you can into the tiny dish.  i was a first timer and didn't know the squish thing or even had an idea what the wax paper was for until i saw other people displaying humiliating , embarrassing ,  disgraceful behavior crushing down food and then piling maybe as high as 10 inches above the bowl. some people actually had to jump in the air to squish. ( i am sorry now i didn't video and send this up to you tube.)  the meats and vegetables seemed fresh and i didn't notice any vegetables being canned (like at the gag us chain) but i really didn't like the watered down sauces. unlike the other stir fry places here you need to add maybe 7 ladle's of sauces to get the correct flavor and then you get a boiled vegetable dish. yuck!  i know most people enjoy coming here and doing the squish thing eating a boiled dish of food for approx. $10 but i can go to my favorite chinese and get a rice bowl that taste better and is bigger and not crushed food for only $3.50 or spring for the whole lunch plate for only $4.95 so you won't be seeing me here again.  as for stir fry places i like the independent stir fry place on bell rd is better than this place or the gag us chain because i don't have to squish down food , i (don't) but i can go back and get as many stir fry's as i like at that place and the sauces aren't watered down so the food comes out better.   to each his own . different stir fry's for different folks eat what you like!",0
"is it ""location! location! location!"" or ""ambiance! ambiance! ambiance!""? the mission has both; it's in an ideal location to begin a night out on the town, and the restaurant's low lighting and sexy decor will had me feeling just as spicy as the latin-infused fare.  my favorite dish, hands down, was a side of creamy grits with chipotle and honey. everything was tasty, duck empanadas, pork belly pibl, guacamole, though nothing especially stood out as much as that humble side of grits mixed with perfection.  the service was a little over-attentive, but the guy was sweet and obviously trying his best. and he was johnny-on-the-spot with the wine, so who can really complain about a few interruptions?   sexy restaurant. satisfying food.",1

"im pretty sure i read about kim kardashian's engagement, wedding, and divorce all while i was waiting in the 100 yard line to try on clothes here. seriously, what takes so long to try on clothes?! every h&m i've been to has a ridiculously long line, what's going on in there?  yes, h&m has trendy clothes for cheap (but ya get what you pay for). if you're looking for an item that you won't be able to wash more than twice before it unravels, then this is the place for you. why 2 stars instead of 1, well the answer is simple. i do, on occasion, find some cute top or dress from here that i end up purchasing cause i can't believe the price. but, i'm quickly reminded as to why the price is cheap when i pull my top out of the dryer. this store also has shoes, hats, sunglasses, and jewelry to help accessorize you outfits and these items do seem to last longer then kim k's marriage :)  also, expect to wait long for checkout as well. those extra two employees, behind the register that aren't open, are probably doing something important.",0

"thought we'd give bluewater another shot for sushi. bad idea, i guess.   long story short, we wanted to eat lightly and ordered a few vegetable rolls.they weren't on the menu (they used to be, at $4 a roll) so i spoke with the sushi chef (not one of the usuals i see there) and asked him to be creative in whipping something up for us. we were served three boring, small (4 pieces including ends) rolls that were severely lacking in creativity or excitement.   bill comes and we're charged for spicy tuna rolls at $8 a pop. whaaaa? first, we didn't eat spicy tuna. we're told that's what they charge for vegetable rolls because they're not on the menu. okay...but again, we didn't order spicy tuna, in fact we ordered the very opposite. and $8 a roll means we would pay $2 per piece of vegetable sushi. no way, man.   it was only after haggling with our server and two managers that we were able to have our bill reduced to a more appropriate price. unfortunately, the whole experience sealed the deal on being totally over the place.   and so begins the search for a new sushi joint... if anyone has suggestions for killer sushi (that includes creative rolls), i'm all ears!",0

"literally...the worst dining experience of my life. so much went wrong (i will try to keep it short).  i made a reservation for 8pm, 8 people on a saturday. i called at 5pm, giving ample notice. walk in at 7:58 (2 minutes early) and the table isn't ready. no bother, we wait outside, chit chat but happen to notice a very sparsely occupied patio, which we could have sat at. 20 minutes later. no table. finally at 8:40 we sit down. what use are reservations? but this isn't the worst part...  we sit and wait for another 10 minutes and are approached by a frantic server: can i get you drinks? sure. we order an excess. (you're about to get tipped well if you can make this happen tonight).  waiting on the drinks...my throat is getting parched...where are the drinks? we get them another 20 minutes later (it's already 9pm folks...an hour after i was supposed to have my table). here comes mr. frantic again - brings 2 drinks...we're missing some.  he apologizes and confesses he forgot to ring in the other.. ya kidding me? finally drops it off. cool...   but the fun doesn't stop there. my friend orders an appetizer. expresses she wants this to be her entree...to be brought out with everyone else's. it does not happen. he just stares at the table, his mouth agape. say something. fix this. send the manager over. do something.  next up? i don't eat meat...i am served meat. cool. frantic server dude is now blaming someone else for this transgression and has the manager come over to drop off my meager  portion of food. the manager says nothing. not ""sorry, not how are you this evening? apologies n such."" just drops it off, and forces a smile. what are we doing wrong here as patrons? am i on freaking candid camera?! (what happened to that show anyway...)  ugh...at this point we all just want to shovel food down our throats and get the hell out. we do the 2 for $40 deal. where's the dessert we ordered? blame the cooks magoo has his back turned to our table, and is chatting away with his friends. this is not a joke. we sit...and sit...and sit...ya think he would have turned around at some point to, i don't know: check on his customers who are going to be tipping him.  finally my friend taps him on the shoulder and asks if he can box up the dessert so we can just take it with us.  i open my leftovers today and not everything's in there. i hate this place. hate. slow...yet the servers run around like chickens with their heads cut off. the food isn't great, that's if they can get your order right in the first place. it's pointless getting a reservation. oh and it was my birthday.  they knew this! their home office should really make a secret shop and see what's happening at the mill ave location.  ya suck.  don't eat here. i know it's mill...but save yourself the 2 hour shit show i experienced.",0
"i previously wrote a review about this bar, but it no longer seems to be on the web site. i have been here multiple times and the food and beer is always consistent. irish nachos are great, the beer is good, and they have a monthly beer special. i also liked it because it was next to my apartment and a good location on gilbert & baseline. a lot of traffic in this area. so why then is the bar usually empty? i have been here on friday nights, saturday nights, and other times most bars would be busy and yet it was not here. in my previous review i included photos showing how empty the bar was and how they had more televisions than patrons. the problem is the bar is marketed toward men who are come there as much for the women working as they do beer, food, or televisions. but too frequently when i visited they had no women. the host was a dude, the server was a dude, the bartender was a dude. on two prior occasions i saw one ""kilt girl"". instead it was dudes in kilts. if i wanted to see that i would stay at home, dig my kilt out of the drawer, and look at myself in the mirror. i did go about two weeks ago and i saw a difference - everyone working (the desk, servers, and bar) were kilt girls.   apparently the change was too little, too late. i saw the signs up yesterday (because i always chuckled at the ""voted phoenix number 1 sports bar"" sign on the side of the building when the bar was usually empty), but today i was surprised to see no signage at all. that stupid sign was down, the name on the building, and the name on the sign all gone. the corporate web site no longer shows the mesa location and going to their page directly shows page not found sorry, that page no longer exists...  i was surprised at the suddeness of operational one day, gone the next but i can't say i am surprised it was closed.",0
"i'm not sure what it is about fatburger that's caused it to fall out of my good graces so, but here we are at two lowly stars. maybe it's because my first fb experience was at the las vegas strip fatburger, at three in the morning, surrounded by hookers, pimps, punters, johns, pushers, bookies, trannies, and all remaining manner of late-night underbelly. it added charm, whimsy, and terrifying people watching.  since then, every time i've been progressively more disappointed. we've reached the nadir here, with burgers that lack any real flavor to me, unless i punch them up with the tasty cholesterol of a fried egg on them. i don't know what they're not doing, but when smashburger just down the street is creating a burger of kings, jam-packed with smash flavor, i can't help but be disappointed at the lifeless patty of beef crying out for a savior of spice. alas, none to be found, it forces its way down my gullet, falling into a heap of shame and indigestion.  the fries are, well, they're run-of-the-mill frozen steak fries.  i suppose for someone that bills themselves as the last great hamburger stand, i really wish they'd focus on, you know, making great hamburgers. for now, i'll swing down to smashburger or, in a pinch, shame-eat at five guys.",0
"we do an ""ethnic dinner"" every other month and this month it was my turn. i am so glad that i picked beaver choice because it was fabulous.  the place itself is tiny and food is ordered from the front counter. the kid that was taking orders was very helpful and a real sweetheart. the wait time is considerable, but as long as you aren't in a hurry, the food is worth the wait.  i ordered the laxpudding with sides of broccoli, home made coleslaw, and dill potatoes. my friend ordered the swedish meatballs.  i'm not sure what i actually received since it doesn't seem to match the description of laxpudding from their menu. i think what i actually received was the salmonburger & skagenrora. it was very good, but i'm not really a salmonburger kind of girl. the topping on it was fantastic though!   the broccoli was delicious and perfectly cooked. the dill potatoes were also very good and holy cannoli, they are seriously dill. if you like dill, try these potatoes.  my friend raved about the swedish meatballs - even scrapping the plate with her fork to try to get any of the remnants. she said they were better than ikea which since i've never tried them and she says they are great, i'm going to assume this is a high compliment to beaver choice's meatballs.  i got a beaver ball to go based on reviews on yelp mentioning them. they were super chocolaty - i think dark chocolate? my husband swears there was coconut in them which he didn't like... i didn't notice coconut, but that doesn't mean anything.  i can't wait to go back to try other things on their menu... especially the schnitzel which is what they are known for. delicious food and excellent, warm service. great place!!",1
"we've been twice now, and nothing we have had has been very good. the ice cream and cake were mediocre, the onion rings were crispy-initially, the burgers were way overdone and made from cheap beef. ask the bone chip in my husband's burger. the mushrooms were the canned pieces and stems variety, and the fries were crispy but heavy. the cole-slaw was excessively sweet and completely limp.   the service has ranged from complete disinterest- no greeting, no eye-contact, and i had to beg for refills- to interactions between employees so uncomfortable that i wanted to say something. it's great if you have rapport, but the customers don't need to see you slap each other around and overhear you gossiping about each other- even in play. or, if you hate your job at 5 & diner, please find another one and stop throwing the dishes around at a volume that hurts my ears and ruins my experience.   management needs to intervene before this phoenix institution falls apart.",0
"let's start by saying that ""tradiciones"" no longer exists and now the place is called ""mariscos vuelve la vida"".   the spanish translation to this phrase is ""seafood gives life"".   ironically, this is what this restaurant is missing... life.  made the mistake of taking some out of town relatives to eat here.  one in the party had been here before when it was tradiciones and fell in love with the patio and the ""mexicaness"" of it all.  is mexicaness a word?  i don't think so but i like it.   we ordered fried tilapia, fried red snapper, two chicken quesadillas, one carne asada platter, one chicken burrito, one modelo negro beer and one margarita.  all the dishes were accompanied by a fake yellow rice and refried beans.  these have to be addressed first.  i say fake yellow rice because they were trying to make the typical mexican rice but failed.  the rice was plain, saltless white rice with a few peas in it.  a mexican place that doesn't know how to make a flavorful yellow rice?? shame, shame muchachos.  what a flavorless scoop of i don't know what!  really?  i told the cook i would gladly come by free of charge and teach the cooks how to make really really good yellow rice but she just listened and then said she would tell the cook.   and now for the refried beans.  mushy, flavorless, saltless something.  if i had had a blindfold i never would have guess i was eating beans.  beans can be soooo delicious made with tender loving care and seasoned properly with garlic, onions and yes...something called salt.   then for the carne asada, aka, shoe leather.  thin slices of beef with no salt or pepper, or any seasoning for that matter.  telling the waitress that it was overcooked and tough when she asked how the food was did not help.  she just walked away.  was she muttering ""that's how we always make it"" under her breath as she walked away?  the two fried fish dishes lacked salt, were overcooked and a tad greasy.  the quesadilla & burrito were passable but nothing  worth a return visit.  however, the modelo negro beer was excellent and that's how this restaurant earned its one star rating.   btw, the chips were fresh and plentiful.  so if you want to go to a restaurant just for chips and water, you are good to go at this place. mariscos vuelve la vida, contrary to its name, will be on its last legs shortly. we should start calling the emt's now and give it some mouth to mouth.  it is going to need it.",0
"when i read the positive reviews of tradiciones on yelp and in the papers, i can't help but wonder why it is that my husband and i have had such different experiences. we've been twice; once the service was barely acceptable and once the service was the worst i have ever had in my life. god only knows why we gave it a second chance. the waitress barely acknowledged us and then completely disappeared midway through our meal. we tried in vain to get the attention of several others, including a manager, to get our check. we ended up waiting at least half an hour, and that was after my husband got up and convinced someone to give a &^%@#.  we both left with the distinct feeling that if we were hispanic, this would not have happened. the food was average: decent chips, good spice level, greasy cheese.",0
"pepin has been around forever and the novelty of the flamenco dancing isn't enough to eclipse the otherwise only-okay food, high prices, and sometimes dodgy service. (not to mention they're randomly-being-closed).   the paella is really quite expensive, and unless they're dumping entire handfuls of saffron into each pan (they're not), it's pretty well over-priced. it's also essentially impossible to share, since it's a per-person charge, which is frustrating.  the crab and black rice croquettes were a pleasant surprise, i'll give them that, but service is typically slow, paella is typically only just decent, and overall, it's not really worth it beyond the initial novelty. (it's really dated inside, to boot.)  i prefer tapas papas fritas up the road a bit, though they don't offer flamenco, but their food quality and service is generally much better.",0
we had a great staycation here. its big and very modern but comfy. the room was really nice and clean.  the pool area was small but pretty and they have a hot tub which we loved late at night.  the restaurant was great there as well. each morning we had the breakfast buffet. room service was great late night and fast.  the staff was really nice and helpful. we had some issues with our keys one night and the security guy came out to help us very quickly.   the space had a convention going on while we were there and it seemed like it was a great spot for them as well.   overall we had a great time!,1
"i never thought it was possible to get crs (chinese restaurant syndrome) at a vegetarian restaurant.  i can't believe i brought my family including one vegan visiting from la to green.  there was no skill or sense in the balance of flavors in any of the dishes.  obviously whoever made the food does not eat it themselves.  all the dishes were overwhemingly drenched in sauce assaulting the taste buds with either saltiness or sourness.    the wings were incredibly sour and then when you dip them into the ranch sauce it becomes unbearably salty as well.  thank goodness for the celery sticks.    the salad contained hardly any figs which we really had to dig for to find two small pieces.  and the balsamic was really sour.  in smaller amounts it would probably have tasted fine.  the apricot miso bowl was really sour again.  and for a vegetarian restaurant, it would've been nice to see more vegetables.  we wish all the sauces came on the side so that we could actually have tasted the other components of the dishes.   the texas portabello po-boy was also over-sauced.  the only redeeming part of it was the tahini coleslaw.  that was nice and crunchy and properly seasoned.  it seems to me that the chef needs to check in on the kitchen or taste his food more often.",0
"the new vig in downtown on fillmore is a cute little restaurant. i really enjoy sitting outside on the patio. everything on the happy hour menu is amazing and my favorite drink is now the moreland marg- it has habanero infused tequila in it and wow it is spicy, but good at the same time.  one of this day i will come back and try out the rest of the menu.",1
"i want to start out this review by saying - i am never going back to moto.   i went there one time with a group. i was excited to try a new sushi place and normally really love sushi. however, there was a really bad odor when i walked in so i opted against trying the fish there out of fear of food poisoning. i can't comment on how the sushi is at moto. instead, i decided to try the pho. i have eaten pho at many places around town and typically enjoy it. not at moto. the broth was a darker color than i am used to and had a funny after taste. i couldn't even get through about 1/4 of it before i lost my appetite.   most of the other members of my group didn't like the food much either. my advice is that there are too many other places near moto for good sushi and pho to risk trying this place.",0
"we went during the week and we were the only customers in the place. the service was great-i'll say that right off the bat. not that the staff had anything better to do, as we were their only customers, but the guy who turned out to be our waiter held the door for us as we entered and left. he refilled our water numerous times, and was prompt with our food.   the food was ok. i ordered pad thai ( i know it's a thai staple but i always really like it, and what better for a test of good thai?) and my man ordered a different noodle dish with the flat, rice noodles. the price was average. i liked my mans' dish better than mine, somehow the pad thai tasted a little....weird. couldn't put my finger on it.   the decor looked like a converted fast food joint. you know how mcdonalds or wendy's will have that glass-enclosed area in the front with the sloped glass ceiling overhead? well, that was there. so it kind of reminded me of such a place.   yah, just wasn't enough to make me want to come back, but i'll still give them props for good service.",0
"have heard good things about this place for months. should have checked yelp for latest before going and could have ducked the bullet that was chicken fried steak lunch.   john p's review said it all.  my lunch was institutional and canned tasting.  the ""real"" mash potato tasted like it could have been fake with a slick & sticky texture. may be breakfast would have been better.",0

"let me just start by saying that i don't like this place, i looooove it! ahhh pita jungle were have you been all my life?! i had heard about this place for years and never went for two reasons.  1. the closest one was in tempe at the time and i lived in n.peoria 2. my husband(you know who you are) wouldn't take me because he didn't like it. booo!  anyway, they finally opened one up in glendale! so hear i am in pita heaven.  i've been a big fan of hummus, but until i tried the cilantro jalapeno hummus here, i had no idea! i could easily lick the plate and if i didn't have to share, i totally would! the pesto, spinach and tomato pizza is amazing and the shwarma is equally delicious!   i just recently made a visit and tried the veggie burger, more like a sandwich only because they serve it on whole wheat slices of sandwich bread. my friend took a look at my plate and gave the look as if to say "" i could have made this at home."" i took a great big bite outta that sad homemade looking thing and didn't stop til she had another look on her face like ""where the hell did your food go?"" the patty was full of chunky vegetables and came with a spread(forgot to ask what it was) that complimented the sandwich quit well. i have also had the thousand bean burrito and it is the only thing that i would not recommend. if your hungry and you love beans, go for it! it's a large portion, they should call it the 7000 bean burrito! i am not that person.  the end",1
"kokopelli winery is in a great location but the food and wine are wanting.   the white wines were very strange and the reds didn't make me want to buy a case.  i did purchase three wines- one white and two reds, hoping that at a later time i might grow to love them.  the whites are too sweet for me and the flavors are weird. yes weird. the food wasn't bad, but we did really enjoy the music.  it is fun just to check out.  i will go back and try different vintages from kokopelli in the future.  it may end up developing some unique vintages and is different enough to make it worth my time.",0

"not sure what the allure is with this place. maybe because it's in scottsdale?? we happened to be in the area on a friday evening so decided to give jalapeno inferno a try. there was already a line forming so we took that as a good sign. a couple of seats opened up at the outside bar so we escaped putting our name on a list. the bartender was friendly, but perfunctory. we studied the menu while we waited for our drinks munched on chips. the salsa was very flavorful, and the chips were part corn- part flour. maybe i'm just a purist, but really?? chips made from flour tortillas? ick! i guess that's how they utilize stale flour tortillas, and the snowbirds probably like 'em. i hate rummaging through the basket to get the corn tortilla chips!  for the entrees we decided on the tomatillo chicken enchiladas and baja fish tacos. both dishes were mediocre. the tacos were short on fish. the enchiladas had an after-hot, which i liked, but they really weren't anything to write home about. glad we tried the place. i can't think of why we'd go back when there are so many really good mexican restaurants in town.",0
"queso dip was good and i loved the thin crispy tortilla chips, but everything else was below average as far as food goes.  service was alright, atmosphere and fun and lively, but it also wasn't terribly clean.  the parking is a royal pain to figure out for the first time, or if it's been awhile since your last visit.",0
wow...this place is good!   a friend of mine and i shared the braised short rib pizza.  it was delicious.  the staff was very friendly and the restaurant had a cozy feel to it.,1

"maizie's cafe & bistro my girlfriend had just finished auditioning for the phoenix choir so i wanted to treat her to a meal. we like to try new things and especially local venues and since we go to lux occasionally had noticed a few new spots just north of there. one of them is maizie's cafe & bistro.  i should have gotten a sense that something was strange with this place when i called to make sure they were open. the woman on the other end seemed taken aback by this simple question. i then asked if they were any good and once again there was a hesitation.  we arrived at around 645 to a fairly packed restaurant which is always a good sign especially on a monday night, right? however i was immediately surprised to see three big screen televisions on each wall save the back one, presumably because this had a wine rack on it... i dont know about you but when a room that is at best 20' x 20' has three 42 inch tv's in it i call that a sports bar, and they had american football on one and what the rest of the world call football on the other. to offset this they did have the third tv set to the food network.  our table was somewhat sticky and when our drinks arrived the coaster for the tea got stuck to the table and eventually peeled away. troubling but i wanted to keep positive since this was a celebration. we ordered wine and a cheese plate and almost immediately were approached by another waitress wondering if we were ready to order. very confusing.  the cheese plate was straight out of home economics. they could have gone to safeway and put a better selection of cheeses together. i would go easier on them except that the ambience and prices are asking for the quality to be better than presented.  my girlfriend ordered the tuna salad and i got the fresh basil pasta with marinara. now i know that one of the hip things to do is have eclectic dinnerware to set your restaurant apart from the rest but serving salads in mixing bowls that dont match the decor is very awkward. throwing a few veggies in said bowl and then a heaping scoop of tuna mix is not an entree, its a lunch item. same goes with the marinara dish. this cacophony of salad items sauteed up and mixed with pasta and a decent marinara sauce is once again lunch fare, not a $12 dinner entree.  throughout the course of this dinner we had both waitresses coming up to us about every 5 minutes to make sure everything was okay. a little hint to good serving: if someone is in the middle of a sentence dont ask if everything is okay. this became very annoying and when i mentioned it to my party we were approached once again, as if they were trying to push the point.  another feature of maize's is that it has free wifi and posts this fact on its doorway. so we are also trying to be a coffee shop/internet cafe. so to add to the glow of plasma screens all around a group of students sit next to our table and launch up three laptops, very romantic indeed.  the piece de resistance thought was when the florescent lighting from the outside awning kicked in halfway through the entrees and we were bathed in a brilliant glow of blandness. at this point we both broke down into laughter at the whole spectacle. the effect was a perfect way to end this experience.  overall maize's is a horribly confused concept with incredibly schitzophrenic tendencies. it wants to be everything to everyone. the look says it wants to be a wine bar, but the tv's confuse that aspect. the menu talks gourmet but the reality is that they are serving lunch fare, which has its place. the free wifi means you will be getting non diners which will only make the diners more uncomfortable. i get a sense of what they are trying to do which is a cafe/bistro, but in order to do that you need to scale down the ultra modern look of the place. from the outside it says dinner but the reality is that its a hangout.  to its credit it was close to full on a monday evening so there seems to be some appeal.",0
"um. . .no.    honestly, i'm in a major snit about this place.  i expected something a lot better than what we found here.  things seemed pretty good to start--food looked tasty.  didn't take long for problems to begin showing up:    first off, my wife's lo-mein was pretty darned lo.  the first time she went here several days ago, they used the normal wide noodle that you would usually find in lo-mein.  this time, they used round noodles.  were they chinese chow mein noodles?  no, they were vermicelli.  yes, i'm being a bit picky there, but i'm just getting started.  my wife ordered the lo-mein with no garlic, onions, or shallots.  the problem was, they left out most of the other vegetables as well when the bowl came to the table.  there was the occasional carrot or broccoli sliver, but very few veggies at all.  i called the waiter over to the table and informed him of the situation.  my wife told him that she just wanted to get a bowl of extra veggies to add to the lo-mein.  he took away the lo-mein that she had and said that he would be back shortly.  when he returned, he came back with two bowls--one had the vegetables she asked for, and the other was a brand new bowl of lo-mein with tofu and noodles only.  uh, what the f*ck?  why replace the noodles she had with this and then send in a separate bowl of veggies?  why not either give my wife back her old bowl along with the veggies or just mix up a whole new batch with the veggies?    major issues here--even what she got after all that wasn't very good tasting.  my wife had to add soy sauce for extra flavor, and the vegetables weren't fresh--they obviously tasted like they were frozen before they were put into the wok.  my food wasn't much better in terms of quality.  i had the vegetable and tofu fried rice.  there was no issue with the quantity of veggies, but they too were of the ""from your grocer's freezer"" variety.  the rice was chalky and undercooked, and i also had to add soy sauce--it didn't do much to improve the flavor.  our spring rolls were also inferior, and even the fortunes in the fortune cookies were as superficial and vapid as the food we ate.  i liked the friendly table service, and the soda machine that allowed you to flavor the soft drinks any way you like was cool.  this is what made this review two stars instead of one.  but, would i recommend pei wei to anyone?  no wei.  if you want a real asian diner, go to tott's asian diner at ray and mcclintock.  now that's fresh food, and a world of difference over pei wei.  even panda express is better than this place.",0
"who wants to ruin a rare date night by sending the food back?  so with brave smiles we fought our way through our meals and tried to focus on the positives:  the perfect table that the nice greeter sat us at , the friendly and solicitous server, the great crab bisque, the perfectly cooked sea bass.  but really, how hard does one have to work to make pork ribs tasteless?  and who in the world thought it would be a good idea to comprise half the ribs' side dish with raw red onions?  for the life of me, i couldn't tell what that side was supposed to be.  the sea bass special that was supposed to have this delicate horseradish sauce turned out to be oversauced with something better described as gloppy than delicate.  its flavors clashed with the sea bass, as did the mashed potatoes...though the three did make a nice white monochrome statement on my plate.  the accompanying baby bok choy was overcooked/mushy.  we were so disappointed (disappointed doesn't describe how my stomach felt all night) that it ruined date night anyway, so we should have spoken up.",0
"okay, i have going here once a week now for months and i just have to say how great this place is once again. for the first 10 times or so i always got the pork bun or the sirloin pho but i am finally starting to break out and try different items on the menu. everything here is awesome! the staff is always the same people and extremely nice and attentive. the place is always very clean. we have to get there when they open because they are starting to get quite popular and people start packing in there for lunch. this place has my repeat business for a long time to come.",1

"so my first experience at bikini will most likely be my last. this past saturday was the night for me to get my long-craved for amaretto sour (followed by some beer of course) but alas, it was served with no less than 6 little creatures with wings!!!! sick. the bartender didn't even offer my money back and i really wasn't up for another drink of anything there after that unfortunate incident. thankfully, we made it to cooperstown right after so the night wasn't totally ruined.",0
"urban yoga is a great mix of what every yogi/yogini is looking for at one time or another:  great instructors (kate, katie, kat, mary bruce,etc.), great products, calming environment, massage therapist on-site, awesome location, and so much more.  in fact, i'm attending kate's class today at 4:30pm!  i often read reviews of someone that is ""trying yoga for the first-time"" and can empathize with them.  it is daunting to go to a new place, feel as though you are starting at the beginning and all the while, your mind cannot turn off (did i lock my car?  i'm hungry.  i like her outfit.).    urban yoga is a great place for a newbie or yoga practitioner with years of experience.  i've only been practicing intentionally for about 3 years and continue to learn and experience it.  yoga is a practice, not a perfect.    the most important part of it?  show up, be present, do the work.",1

"we visited santan on a very busy afternoon, this past week, and despite the crowds, we received exceptional service all around.  we sat down and immediately ordered our appetizers and first drink(we wanted to get our order in before happy hour ended). within 5-6 minutes, our food was on the table, fresh and hot.  we had the pineapple habanero bbq wings(sweet and sticky, with the flavor, but not the heat, of habanero). i'd also requested two extra sides of hot sauce, expecting frank's red hot...nope! i received what can only be assumed to be a house-made hot sauce. it was tangy, spicy(but not unbearable), and chock full of flavor and spices.  we also ordered the house-made cilantro hummus platter...replete with tons of fresh, delicious beer bread(like pita, but more flavorful), tortilla chips(salty and good), plenty of kalamata olives, cucumbers, and grape tomatoes.  and the soft pretzels(served with nacho cheese and beer mustard) were great! tons of salt, a nice coating of butter, and the mustard was flavorful and delicious.  hubby ordered the special--bayou skewers--for his meal. wow. charred, smoky, herby chicken, tomatoes, pearl onions, peppers, and corn(omg yum), all skewered and served with a 'cajun aioli'(which was a bit bland...we added some of the aforementioned hot sauce, and that fixed it).  as for the beers...i started with mr pineapple(light, fresh, fruity...perfectly refreshing on a hot day), followed by the nitron ipa(dark, hoppy, a bit bitter, but rich and delicious), and ended with the gordo stout(a little watery, but flavorful...chocolatey, coffee flavors).  overall, this was fantastic. our server was attentive(my husband's soda was always full) and friendly, and everything was delicious and prompt. definitely will be returning :)",1
we went here for a new years eve party. we assumed it was going to be more relaxed and mature since it was located north and away from its old town counterpart the place was entirely full of guys. our group consisted of couples and it was irritating as several drunk guys kept trying to approach our significant others. i can't say i blame those guys and i felt bad for them as well since they paid a lot of money to attend this party and meet women and there were none. it eventually turned into another scotsdale club scene. it was not classy. the dance floor was claustrophobic.,0
"yes, this is the place from the opening credits of the sitcom ""alice"" from the 70's.  located near downtown and roughly 15 minutes from the airport, it's in a seedy part of phoenix and surrounded by industrial type buildings.  open only for breakfast or lunch, in this area, you could do much worse.  food is diner food with plenty of calories and grease to go around.  stick to the basics (not that the menu get's complicated or anything).  eggs bacon hash browns etc...  a cheeseburger at lunch.  not exceptionally clean.  use the bathroom somewhere else before arriving.",0
"i went there the other night for dinner.  granted, i was there early but other than two people sitting talking in the restaurant, there was nobody there.   i ordered a chicken arepa, shredded beef empanada, and the ground beef pastelito.   the kid who took my order behind the counter said it would take 15 to 20 minutes.  i couldn't figure out why it would take so long-maybe they had a lot of take out orders for pizza (they share the same kitchen with rosati's).  instead of taking 15 to 20 minutes, i'm waiting there around 30 minutes, the kid has disappeared, and once in awhile, i see some other guys in the back.  they must know i am waiting, but not once does anyone come out and tell me that my order will be out shortly.  finally, some other guy who looks like he could be the boss asks me what i ordered.  i tell him, and he brings out my bag, which seemed to have been sitting there for who knows how long.  it seemed hot so i left and did not complain.  as far as the food, never having had an arepa before, i was not too impressed.  it was somewhat bland and it tasted like a taco.  the empanada was incredibly greasy.  the pastelito was the best-the ground beef was tasty.  i might go back and try some other items on their menu but they need to improve on their customer service especially when there is virtually no one in their restaurant.",0
"i'm going to suggest brooklyn nyc pizza could use a few more people working when there is a diamondbacks game and a concert on a friday night.  the few peeps that were working did not seem to have any sense of urgency.  the guy working the register was also the guy serving the beer.  so, if you order beer, you hold up the line of people ordering because he has to stop what he is doing to fill your beer.    there were two people standing in the back hanging out waiting for pizzas to cook.  the line was crazy long and there was not much room to stand.  it was pretty warm and stuffy inside so we let the boys stand in line for our pizza and beer while we secured the wobbly table on the patio.    there were only tables for four available, so when they got back, two of the boys were going to have to stand.  also, the table was kind of dirty (maybe-washed-once-a-week-use-your-hand-sanitizer-after-you-touch-it dirty).  luckily there was a roll of paper towels hanging from the table.  that might be the one good thought the owner of the place had!  there were six of us, so we wanted a whole pie, but they wouldn't do that.  um . . . okay . . . could you give us 8 individual slices and then put them all together on one pan?  really?  how does it make sense to not give us a whole pie?  the pizza was nothing too exciting.  the cheese was kind of like glue and the slice of pepperoni had a pool of grease that had dripped from the pizza to the pan.  funny, i did like the sauce, a little on the tomato-y side, which i like.  now i see why i haven't been there for lunch either.  with so many delicious pizza options (zpizza, papa cristos, cafe roma, hanny's, etc.) why would i go here?  maybe for the cheap lunch special, but i'd rather spend a little more money on good food.  anyway, i wish some of the better bars were closer the big venues downtown.  it seems like all of the other places are just out of walking distance for a quick bite before an event. next time, i will convince the group to walk one or two more blocks to find one of the really yummy places.",0
"houston's is good but definitely not the caliber that they used to be.  the service was sub-par, the food was good this time but has been hit and miss the past couple of times.  they are missing the consistency that you used to be able to rely on.  also, when we ordered a birthday brownie, they didn't bring a candle and they billed us for it - seriously?! (the waitress knew as she said ""oops, i forgot the candle"")  between that and charging $3 per soda, it just seems like they are nickle and diming their customers to death.  j alexanders has the same food with the same hit and miss service so, why pay more at houston's.    the food we had this time was their spinach/artichoke dip with chips and we each got their chicken salad which seemed to have more peanuty spice to it which we enjoyed.  their brownie dessert is to die for....probably literally with all that sugar but oh so good.  the total for the food and 2 sodas and tip was $70 (no alcohol!).  you can go to a lot better places for $70 or spend half as much for the same food across the street at j alexanders.  houston's no longer offers anything that distinguishes themselves or makes them worth it.",0

"i guess if the good egg was the only breakfast place around, i'd give it 3 stars, but every time someone suggests eating there, here's my thought process: how about over easy? d'lish? scramble? oh, i know, matt's big breakfast! or daily dose? what about breakfast club? or true food for brunch? literally anywhere else, please jesus, save me from the mediocrity.   the good egg doesn't even set the bar particularly high for its eggs.. i mean, they only have to be ""good"". unfortunately, they suck. i have never had a good egg here, ever, nor a good anything else. maybe because everything on the healthy menu tastes like cardboard and everything not on the healthy menu tastes like diabetes... but seriously. sorry, establishment, but i've eaten at you about seven times now (against my will) and you are frustrating me with your lack of effort.  perhaps if the food was incredibly inexpensive (like how it tastes), i'd see the merit in eating here once in a while, for convenience's sake. the thing is... it's not even cheap. plus, i can definitely make everything on their menu at home. here's my recommendation: if you hate cooking as much as you hate eating interesting food, the good egg will suffice.",0
"we had high hopes for this place.  rave reviews (mostly), and personal recommendations.  heck, if you don't have a reservation you probably aren't getting in!  what a disappointment.  even with the reservation we had to wait about 15 minutes.  menu looked appetizing.  sounded very up-scale!    i had the salmon.  if you can call it that.  the actual salmon was microscopic.  a tiny piece perhaps 2"" square by about 1/2"" thick.  that's it.  the rest was ""greens"".  apparently they expect you to fill up on ""greens"".  and the flavor of that miniscule bit of salmon was just ordinary.  nothing special.  one person had a sandwich.  it was small, but bigger than the salmon.  it was reasonably tasty.  at least as good as quiznos.  but, again, nothing special.  also, you have to ask for bread service.  it's complimentary, but if you don't ask you don't get.  and the bread wasn't even warm.  the lemonade was really sub-par.  not good.  the one bright spot was that their apricot tea is really outstanding.  if you like salads and ""greens"", you might like this place.  the person we went with had been there before, and she loved her strawberry salad.  but even she commented that the portion size had shrunk (she had never finished a whole serving before, but this time she did).  the other two salad-eaters in the group weren't as impressed (they didn't get the strawberry salad, though).  overall...i'd skip this place.  drop in and buy the tea (they sell it in leaf form), but skip the food.  overpriced, undersized, and nothing special on the flavor front.",0
"i'm impressed. the last time i experienced service this bad it was intentional, on account the manager of the place turned out to be my girlfriend's ex-boyfriend and hated my guts. but today at changs was like the perfect storm - the simultaneous occurrence of employee mistakes and oversights which, taken individually, would be far less powerful than the overall experience resulting of their chance combination...  first i had to send my hot and sour soup back because of the chicken (don't eat chicken, wouldn't have ordered it had it been mentioned on the menu) in exchange for crab wontons. i should have asked, right - that's what you're thinking... well, maybe so. regardless, it took ten minutes to flag someone down to make the exchange, and as a result, the lemon pepper shrimp entree we ordered arrived before the appetizer, without plates, with white rice instead of requested brown. ten minutes for the brown rice, fifteen for the plates, and we had to ask for them three times. three times. the last time the guy actually laughed like, ""oh my god i'm such an idiot, i forgot again, ha ha."" jerk. then we waited another 20 minutes for a refill of tea, another 10 for water. the food? it was ok. borderline good. but certainly not worth the wait and the service.  when we got the bill, of course the hot and sour soup was still on it, so that had to be corrected, which took another fifteen minutes. and then - and this is the icing on the cake, the real kick in the teeth, the coup de grâce: there was no fortune in my damn fortune cookie. that's right. no fortune. what's a fortune cookie without a fortune? just a damn cookie, that's what. no fortune. that's f'd up. it's like a bad omen or something, isn't it? f these guys.",0

"it was definitely a pleasant surprise the first time ventured into tryst cafe.  everything was so fresh, delicious, perfectly cooked, and the portions were substantial.   the restaurant has very spacious, wide open layout with trendy tables/seating in the patio area.   if you are at desert ridge, skip the chain restaurants, and head over to tryst cafe instead!     - hummus trio (traditional, cilantro, and red pepper) come with fresh pita or cucumbers (gluten free).    - tryst ahi tuna salad - excellent portion and very fresh.  i would just ask for extra dressing on the side. - portobello sandwich - it was very juicy, tasty and satisfying.  the grilled bell peppers and portobello will fall off of your sandwich.  - monte cristo (two french toast slices, ham, gruyere cheese topped with strawberry jam) - it is not greasy, and melted perfectly with the gruyere cheese.   - sweet potato tots are the best!  try dipping with hummus dips if you have any left.  skip the regular ketchup.  what a deal!  all food and drinks are half off 3-6 everyday.  after 5pm receive 2 for 1 cocktails.",1
extremely disappointed in their burritos. the two that a friend and i ordered was filled with meat and barely anything else. the burrito was so limp i felt bad eating it.  never going back.,0
"no. that's all i can say. the ramen left something to be desired - i'd prefer phu any day. the atmosphere was cool - bright red phone booth inside to pique your curiosity. the variety of bread they serve is a welcome change. my dining companion enjoyed the rare (and new) ""yogurt beer.""   i would go back to try another entree, but i would stay away from the ramen.",0
"while i don't falter often from my usual order, everything from pita jungle that i've had has been great. i usually get the half jalapeno/half roasted red bell pepper hummus followed by the glazed chicken lavosh. the lavosh is absolutely amazing, toasted in their wood fire oven and topped with generous portions of the honey glazed chicken and feta cheese. the half green tea/half lemonade arnold palmer is my refreshment of chioce, refreshing my taste buds and preparing them for another round of the excellent food.   the servers here are great too, but i don't mean in a white-glove waiter sort of way. these are the people that are fresh off the bong, and honestly, i'm surprised the food even makes it to the table intact. don't get me wrong, if they were to change this i may not frequent as much. i enjoy my fare share of baked-out-of-their-mind servers, there's just less stress!    the only negative thing i can think of about this place is that the dishes are a little too expensive to make it a weekly stop and the tables are pretty crowded together. other than that i've never seen anything to complain about.   i also love the ever-changing art from local talent! very chill place...",1
"five stars, for a little hole in the wall chinese joint? yes, i'm serious. now, before you elite's rip me a new one, and call for my elite badge to be removed...i should say that i was really in the mood for chinese food. i mean really in the mood for chinese food. typically nights like last night, i would've settled for chex mix, beef jerky, fried chicken, doritos or even taco bell....catch my drift here?  ok, so i'm ready for chinese food. i'm starving. the kind of hunger that could put even third world nations to shame (too insensitive?).  i ordered the almond chicken, egg rolls and brown rice. when i picked it up, the guy that was at the counter was pretty cool. he had one of those voices that made him seem like a character from a 1980's nintendo game...(think piston honda from mike tyson's punchout). he was pretty cool.  well, he was cool until, he asked, ""all this food for you?"" yes. it was all for me. clearly he couldn't take a hint by my condition. oh well. he was still really cool. i lied to him btw. i told him, it was for me and my friend. so he gave me two sets of chopsticks.  the food was amazing. actually no. it was more like a religious experience. yes, that freaking amazing. and no, this isn't like five star, white cloth dining. this is the kind of amazing food you eat out of a box, on your favorite couch, watching archer, south park, tosh.0, or family guy.  epic food. i am coming back. i don't care if it's unhealthy. i work out six days a week just for this.",1
"talk about a huge wrap around patio! wow! the lighting is kind of dark inside, but that's probably intentional for atmosphere. i ordered the basil and pesto linguini with chicken. it was good, but i was full after a few bites so i asked for a take out box. unfortunatley, i didn't realize that i had left the box on the table until i got to my car. the box was gone when i came back in to ask for it so the manager had a whole new meal prepared for me. how could i not be happy with that? hence, i was able to have three meals for the price of one. #happydiner",1
"last night i introduced my friends to my fiancé. it took me a long time to decide on the perfect restaurant for us all to get together for some wonderful food and drinks. i remembered going to havana cafe before and enjoyed it quite a bit, so finally decided that would be the spot. sadly, this time around it wasn't very impressive. my drinks were verrrrrry weak, my food was not flavorful or even displayed in an appetizing manner. the appetizers and dessert were good, but not amazing. i'm not sure why last night was different, but it was different enough to ensure that i probably won't return. that makes me sad.",0
for the whole story of my experience here refer to aletheia's post (my sis).  i wanted to put my two cents in that it was extremely over priced and the katsu was really really dry. as an example it was dryer than when i wake up after sleeping with my mouth open in phoenix.  definitly sat in awkward silence for awhile though... :\  good thing we had a gift card to this place...cause i would be upset if i had to pay that much for this place and recieved poor quality food like that... definitly not going back again...unless it is free.,0
"went here last night for a very late night dinner.  who knew people still went out after 11pm for drinks and dinner in chandler!  i feel like i've turned in to a fuddy-duddy... home by 7, in bed by 9 - what have i become!?!  well we had just finished watching our friend's trapeze performance nearby and this was one of the few places that said it was open till 2am in chandler... so here we came at about 10pm... had to wait a few minutes to get patio seating.  i can't believe they were that busy.  gawd, i'm old... and slightly lame.  anywhooo... my friend from work, a bit of a beer snob, had told me that if i wanted to enjoy their beers, i should try the epi-devil (50/50 epicenter & devil's ale), so i did.  everyone else got devil's ale and the pineapple hefe... mine, by far, was the most well-rounded, palatable beer... my friend was right, the 50/50 mix helps tame the hop-piness of devil's ale and i really enjoyed my beer.  i got the chandler street tacos and did enjoy the filling, just not the lame flour tortilla.  you'd think that street tacos was not a neighborhood staple.. i mean, come on, we're on arizona ave, well known for all it's mexican food joints and plenty of taco stands and you serve so-called street tacos with flour tortillas?  really?  anyway, if they had done corn tortillas, i'd given the tacos alone 5 stars because they were pretty damn yummy... 4 star tacos for using flour tortillas.  oh yeah and the beans were not tasty at all.. and hubby's tortilla soup was downright gross.. but his pulled pork sandwich was very good.  so.. i guess they are more successful with their main dishes and their sides are just 'no bueno'.  service was excellent - cute server gal, quick, friendly, did her job well.  the atmosphere was alive, energetic, young, but well-balanced with some older folks and some young'ns.  a bit loud, but then again, it is a bar..   i'd come back again for an epi-devil and try some burgers, after all, i did enjoy the meats and flavors.. mohammad n. really does describe their burgers quite well and i'd love to try one of them.",1
"had my first visit there this afternoon.   very good broth in that pho. i had a large bowl of the number one ""everything"" version (complete with tripe). the meat had been cooked long enough to be tender. the spring rolls were good but not that far above average.  perhaps one of the best indications of a good ethnic restaurant: there were plenty of customers of the ethnicity in question.   service was very good. the spring rolls came out almost immediately as an appetizer, which differs from many other places i've been.  so yes, i'll be back.",1
"i've been to ultra star a number of times and have been underwhelmed each visit. the one plus to this theater is that it's within walking distance of my house. it's not my favorite theater but we've kept going back from time to time simply due to its location--not because we like it.   for a newer theater, it's kind of dumpy. the lobby is too small and crammed with stuff for functionality. the carpet looks old and trampled and kind of old-school versus the competitor theaters. bathrooms are just kind of bleh and most of the time, not terribly clean.   if you go to the first show of the day, expect that the theater will not open until 15 minutes before said showing starts. sure, it's $5.50 for the first show, but the staff is so freaking slow, you've missed all the previews and often times, at least the first 5 minutes of the movie too!  concessions are ridiculously overpriced. this chain is a california-based chain and they charge california prices for their concessions. they offer no frequent movie-goer discounts or bonuses at all. and again, the staff is so freaking slow for really no good reason.  at least the popcorn is fresh tasting.   ultra star is also pretty darn stingy with what it will donate to local non profits as well which for me is a downer.   all in all, i don't see this place open in another 5 years. the theater is never packed and again, with california prices but located in surprise bordering el mirage...i just don't see it surviving much longer. and when i have the choice, i drive to the competitors 90% of the time.",0
"this bar is the coolest hang bar in valley.  i liked it so much i moved across the street from it.  the patio is huge and usually always buzzing with drunks and attractive women or the ever coveted hybrid of those two groups.  they have a decent tap, and the place is relatively well priced.  it seems to be the central nodal point of the tempe hipster scene.  i met a lot of people through there.  a good place to go if you're single or as a couple.  if you're a guy, you even get to piss in their ""blarney stone"".   the bartenders are super cool, and make seriously stiff cocktails.  go there, tonight.",1
"absolutely unimpressive. went here for lunch yesterday with a couple of workmates. which was a tuesday - a day on which, inexplicably, all other vietnamese restaurants in the area are closed - so at least this was an initial point in their favour. if you've read my other vietnamese restaurant reviews you'll know that i only ever eat pho (dac biet) and was planning to order that here. eyes popped out of my head when i saw that they charge $10 for a bowl! there also weren't different sizes for the dish, so i guessed (correctly, as it turns out) that they only had a small size. still, i decided to give it a shot. i also noticed that their menu was extremely limited - there were almost more varieties of spring roll, which i hate, than pretty much any other food category. the waiter told us that they were famous for their rolls.. whatever. i got the pho.  it was a small size. of course.  in fact, the amount of pho in the bowl was positively pissant. within maybe five minutes i had finished it off completely and was still quite hungry. and just like saigon kitchen in surprise, they served a small fistful of bean sprouts, some pathetic wilted basil, and a couple of tiny slices of lime. basically a kids-meal-sized amount of garnish. oh, and a tiny dish with nothing on it (arguably to contain sauce, though there was no sriracha or anything else on the table). the broth was almost tasteless and there were no tendon pieces at all. trust me, i looked hard. i spent the next ten minutes fishing forlornly, and mostly unsuccessfully, for strands of noodles at the bottom of the broth.  they had a telly showing the olympics above the bar. unfortunately, half the communal dining benches face the opposite direction so i had to watch sally pearson take gold in the women's 100m hurdles in an ornate mirror. that was the high point of the experience.  they then gave us the wrong bill, which was presented as a receipt pinned to a small block with a cheap wooden clothespeg. might as well have printed it on a sheet of sh1tter paper too.  won't be going back. barely got two stars. i'm happy to wait out the ""vietnamese weekend"" - ie tuesday - in future, and grab a bowl of pho that's twice the size and thrice the flavour for three bucks cheaper at pho thanh, da vang, maxim or 43rd express. if you like spring rolls, knock yourself out. if you like pho, freakin' avoid this place like the plague. remember, new india bazaar is a couple hundred yards down the road, and they have all you can eat - and all the flavour you need - for $8. i couldn't agree more with matthew k - the value is way out of line.",0
"i remember the first time i went to a cpk in california and i thought it was great. this was, however, in my younger years and long before i caught the foodie bug. now i am enlightened to what pizza really can be, and cpk just doesn't hit the mark. their pastas are just average, too. and everything is overpriced. but what really earns them only 2 stars is their service. it's obvious that no one enjoys their jobs. do yourselves a favor, yelp it up, and find a better pizza place to go at a better value.",0
"this is a delicious neighborhood restaurant!  i can't speak to their sushi much because i have become such a fan of other items on the menu. the handful plus times i have had sashimi here it has always been good.  now on to my favorites! the asian nachos are a must get. instead of tortilla chips they use wonton chips. topped with a yummy cheese sauce, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. their guacamole is a mix of avocado and edamame. yum! add some chicken and these are super yummy and great for sharing.  during my most recent visit here i discovered they have a new edamame. bun bo edamame. it's very spicy. too spicy for my tongue but the friend i was with loved it.  saved the best for last - the mojo dessert. i am not a big dessert person, but i almost always order dessert here. it looks like a sushi roll. you get rice krispy treats, rolled up with nutella, ice cream and a brownie in the middle. delicious!!!",1
"wow!! glad we finally made it to los taquitos! we came for our 1st (and certinaly not last) visit to lt and gotta tell ya - there is a good reason there is a buzz around it!  the carne asada was very tasty in my street tacos, the carnita and pastor meat were very tasty and tender.  their ""hot"" sauce in the bottles on the table is a good blend of taste/sweet with a little heat.  can't wait to go back and try more from the menu!",1
this is my favorite breakfast spot!  the menu is so diverse and the food is delicious.  the bloody mary's and coffee are good too.  they also open early which is nice.  too many good breakfast spots don't open early enough to be breakfast and not brunch. i have yet to come here for any other meals or to enjoy the drinks that look incredible but i will soon :),1
"very good margaritas (although tough to discern quality after your first one is down the hatch) and pretty nice guacamole... sorry, but i make it better. the first time i went to this place, i felt it was an amazing experience, and by far the best chicken tortilla soup i have ever had, followed by one of the best carne asada plates i have ever had as well. so i recommend it for a business outing, which gets everyone excited. drinks are fine, orders are taken and the guacamole begins to get prepared table side. as soon as we begin to dive into the guac, the soup arrives. one of our guests was in the restroom, and his soup was served while he was away. bad, bad waiter. hot, cold, warm dish... whatever, you do not serve an empty seat.   while enjoying our soup, entrees come out and were placed right next to our arms on sizzling hot plates. no one was even half way through their soup. i was furious and felt obligated to quickly shovel my soup so i could bring the dinner plate to my front and eat.   our waiter came over to clear the soup bowls and asked how dinner was and if he could bring anything. ""how about desert right now"" i remarked, and unfortunately, he did not get the sarcasm.   food = 4 stars  service = 0 stars",0
"again, this is part of my comittment to try a restaurant 3 times before reviewing.  my 3rd visit was this weekend and the feeling is still the same.... bocca is just another postino rip off, only with average pizza added to the menu.    the pizza is nothing special.  the sandwiches are okay, but you can find better at a deli.  beer list is decent.  (tripel karmaliete, yes!)   bruschetta planks are just like the boards at postino.  literally, only one was different (pulled pork and pesto).  you get more at postino and they cut them into halves at bocca while they are sliced into 4 pieced at postino so more people can try them.   simply put... it's decent for a spot on mill ave, but there is absolutely nothing special about this place.  blaaaaah.",0
"meh.  chain brewery/pub/restaurant that always seems to produce reliable mediocrity.  i end up here when others want to go, but never by choice.  this time i figured i'd try the fish and chips, since you can't screw up something so simple (or so i thought).  well, it was the blandest fish ever, plus overcooked until it was hard and chewy.  the fries were wet, soggy, and limp.  barely edible overall, and certainly not anything like you'd expect from a place that promotes itself as an upscale pub.  don't bother; any random neighborhood bar is a better gamble than this known mediocrity.",0
"very tasty!!  the handmade tortillas are wonderful, the taste and the heat are very good, tender pork rib meat and the stacked enchilada's are muy delicioso!!    decor is actually pretty cool, especially considering it is in an auto repair complex, maybe that adds to the experience!  we will certainly be going back!",1
"damn some of the gift cards i get as a teacher. i feel obligated to use them, even if i'd really rather not. the $30 i just got for joe's crab shack was such a dilemma. so hubby and i went yesterday since we would be in the area anyway. our expectations were pretty low, so some elements of the meal actually met or even exceeded those expectations.  we had the seafood fondue appetizer, which was ok, but complete garbage compared to pappadeaux's. hubby had the shrimp po-boy which came in a traditional presentation but with fried shrimp that he described as one step above cocktail shrimp. i myself would not have taken it so far, and out of pity, i gave him a bunch of superior shrimp from my platter. i had a reasonably decent mix of coconut, parmesan panko, and seasoned fried shrimp. i also made the wise choice of asking for a sub of onion rings instead of fries. hubby's fries were inedible, as if they had been triple fried. hard as a rock. my onion rings were thin and mostly crispy. at least they tasted fresh.   when the bill came, we were rather shocked. it was pretty pricey at over $40 for lunch. frankly, i wasn't all that thrilled about spending nearly $20 (with tip) after my gift card was applied. when you consider that we would have gotten a far superior meal at pete's fish and chips for about $12, joe's is a sad place- no wonder they were practically empty.  update: i just returned from a wedding where i happened to run into a former student who works at the joe's at arizona mills mall. she said her store has been rated the best in the southwest, whereas this southern & mcclintock store is just not very good.",0
"i will never drink another iced coffee unless it comes from royal at the market.  ever. i promise. seriously.  if my hot cup of coffee gets lukewarm, i'll be forced to throw it away because then i'd be cheating on you.  and that would be rude and mean.  i'd never hurt your feelings like that. i promise.",1
"there are so many more places you can spend your hard earned cash and get a much better meal. telling the truth is not slander.    yes, the chips and salsa are good. they, however, are not the meal.   i find the food to be bland with a mushy texture.  for example, the picadillo tastes like something you could buy a mix at a grocery store and make at home.    the restraunt is cute-looking, but dirty.  the rafters have dust bunnies.  the last unfortunate meal i ate there, we were seated by a group.  the restraunt was not busy at all.  the server never came to collect my card so we could leave.  i ended up taking it to the hostess.  if you want sub-par food, sucky service, and a dirty restraunt do go here.",0
"i drove all over town because i was lost. i thought i knew tempe. you would think i could use siri or my map on my phone.  no i guess i am stubborn.  anyway i did find it but it was not easy to get into the area so i had to drive around again until there it was right in front of me.  finally i ordered a burger,fries and a diet coke.  i was content and could try and find my way back to chandler.  well once again i used my keen senses to find my way back.  i was so happy to be home.    i am glad i live where there is no in-n-out but if there was one around home i think i would seek it out here and there.  i love burgers but i really am crazy for their fries.",1
"sadly, i think the last time i dined here was my last.  i always feel gross after ingesting items off of their soy-filled menu. so, i tried a salad and was utterly disappointed.  when it comes down to it, i'd rather spend my money on real food, not fake meat and fake cheese and fake this and that.    keep it real...er...well, you just keep it.",0
"this library is amazing.  even if you don't read, its worth coming in and checking out just for its amazing architecture and views.  i mean, how many libraries do you know with a waterfall/pool inside? it is very tranquil if you are looking for somewhere to get away from it all and just enjoy your book.  (or do your homework).  location is excellent, being that it's right on the light-rail as well.  i don't know how anyone cannot enjoy a library.  all that being said, i do have one criticism.  the people at the help desks are not the most friendly or helpful.  on more than one occasion i have asked for help, and received a  really sub-par answer, or felt like i'm being sneered at.  so as long are you not planning on talking to the help desk, you are in for quite a treat.",1
"let me start with the positive - the service was exceptional.  very friendly and attentive.  the margarita on happy hour was very good and the prices were excellent.  now, for the negative: the food and the atmosphere.  the atmosphere is horrid.  as other reviews have mentioned there are kids running around during happy hour (really?!) and it is very sterile and lacking in ambiance.  the food was mediocre at best.  definitely won't be making a return trip which is too bad as the service was wonderful and i love cork,",0
"high prices, slow service.  15 bucks for a pollo poblano burrito with fries. choice of salad or fries. after 15 min of waiting, i received my burrito with a salad. so i asked for my fries. they simply scraped the salad off the plate and plunked fries on top of the balsamic mess. my burrito was soggy, mediocre amount of chicken, and the vinegar taste was strong. another thing i didn't like was that if you order takeout you cannot sit in the seating area. dine in only. it's an airport. i don't have time to wait for someone to bring me a check when i'm trying to catch a plane. i'm not stopping here again. pizza hut probably would've been worth the walk...another note, the drinks in the cold case were warm so they had a bucket on the counter with ice. this ensured colder drinks but it was crowded and i almost pulled a muscle trying to lean over to get the drippy water on the other end of the counter.  i don't understand why the cashier couldn't have just handed me one as she saw me struggle. just a negative experience all around. :( see pix.",0
"i went here once - and unless i'm given a rousing speech as to why i should return - i'll never go back.  a few of us went there to see if the volleyball courts were open and if not just to grab a drink before our night got started.   so i'm queer and i kind of assume that if i walk into a gay bar, i won't be discriminated against. wrong. i literally was given the nastiest looks and was literally told, ""no. what the fuck do you want? the volleyball courts are not open.""  seriously? clearly, i'm not there to scam on your men as i walked in with other lesbians. seriously. so rude and disrespectful to paying (gay!) customers. wow.   two stars because they do have volleyball and the drink i was able to harass the bartender to give me was good. and it appears from other reviews that this is not an isolated incident. we get it guys, you're a boy bar...but you're still a bar. how about you tone down the hostility.   seriously.",0

"i went to the compound strictly to see a band play. i did not try any of the food, so i can only comment on this place as a music venue.   the compound really needs to rethink the set up of this place. it's more of a resaurant and any band playing there almost gets resigned to background music. i don't like the set up of the tables. it's just not great for watching a band. you have the servers passing by every few minutes to take orders and deliver food to tables. this is distracting for someone trying to enjoy the music.  i think it would be best if the restaurant was seperated from the stage area.  though the band i saw at the compound was awesome, i would probably not go back to the compound for a concert unless it was a band i was truly dying to see. the set up of this place i find just that bad.  i may go back to try the food, but as far as seeing a band here the experience wasn't that great to make me come back for a concert.",0
"i've been to this bar on several occasions, a couple times for happy hour and a couple times paying retail.  i seem to be hooked on their nacho mama's chips because every so often i get a strong craving for them.  they're different from the typical chip, its somehow puffed up.  the salsa that comes with it is a good accompaniment and i always end up going through at least 1 refill of it.  i usually don't like the cheese melted on top method that solidifies halfway through (versus the nacho cheese sauce), but it goes well with the chips.  i think if you have 3-4 people and you share its perfect, portion wise and cheese wise.  the sliders are ok, pretty typical.  kinda dry, i like to cover mine with ketchup.  the crapcakes are good, but pretty small.  i keep meaning to try some of the dinner items on the menu.  the beer is kinda pricey retail - it was $5 for draft hefeweisens when i went last night.  it wasn't happy hour but geez..",1
"i think olive garden is like going to italy compared to this place. i hated it, will never go back.  i have only been once and you will have to drag me back kicking and screaming.  the food just isn't good, i think lean cuisine would have been more satisfying.  okay, i'm being harsh, but i honestly think it is the worst italian food that i have ever had.  even my bf hated it and he will eat almost anything without complaining about it. the waitress was also weird and a bit rude, but i think she was actually trying to be funny.   to sum it up, this is probably my last choice for italian food.",0
"last night was my 2nd visit to this place in 3 years which is far too long between visits.  i love love love this place.  the decor, service, and food are all top notch. here is the rundown of our meal:  roasted brussels sprouts = excellent caesar salad = excellent mozzarella en corrozza (crispy house made mozzarella) salad = excellent roasted corn pizza = excellent pesto pizza = excellent funghi pizza = excellent pepperoni pizza = excellent  i literally cannot say enough good things about the food here.  i could write a page on each one of the pizzas, but then i would get hungry and carbs are my enemy.  the only thing that fell short was the arancine (crispy saffron risotto).  it was a fried ball of risotto with marinara sauce.  it was just ok to me.  can't wait to return.",1
"in context  of eating prior to  hockey.  we've usually avoided this location on game night since the 30-45 min waits rarely fit in with our plans.this saturday ,mar14th ,we made a deliberate attempt to get in , waited 30 mins. got in around 1800, game starts 1900 . the appetizer, entree and drinks were pretty good but we had 2 1/2 yard drinks  which made it hard to have the plate right in front of us.     1/2 a burger and 1/2 the fries are just swept up by the staff. no attempt to verify our intentions just whoosh.  server aimee was apologetic and would have gotten us replacement fries ( no burger seemingly) or the manager but we had a game to get to that would have been disrupted by either offer. the $80 check for two people has to come with a degree of care and attention that weren't obvious.  so the food is certainly worth a 3.5 , but i can't recall the last time we had our plates taken with such ""reckless efficiency""  update: have received a $25  certificate for this process and will  put it towards another outing( probably at another  of their locations).   update 2:  actually we reconsidered it and decided that  this was a poor attempt to resolve a situation that shouldn't have occurred. it's off our list.",0
"love pita jungle! this is location we come to most often; the staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is a little more relaxed than some of the other locations we have tried.  quick fix for mediterranean and middle eastern food with a relaxing environment and very accommodating and friendly service. the servers know their food and the chefs are able to make adjustments as needed. the owners are usually there, and the food and service never fall short.  the only thing we don't like about coming to pita jungle is we nearly always end up getting the same thing! the food that we get is so good, but we try to force ourselves to sample the big variety on the menu. their daily specials offer new experiences that keep you coming back for more.  hummus is just right (try the cilantro-jalepeno hummus), baba ganoosh is my favorite dip, and they do falafel crispy, light, and full of spice.  salmon, mahi mahi, chicken combo, chicken del sol... they're all great! the side of beans is warm and comforting, and the light and fluffy garlic dip goes great with the chicken and pita bread. we always get the tabouli (taboule), and usually always get more to-go. the burgers are really moist and filling so there is something on the menu for everyone. the lavosh pizza is light, super crisp, and is packed with flavor.  if you're looking for a good sampler, try the mediterranean platter. it serves great as an appetizer.  this is the place to stop for an extremely casual and friendly lunch or dinner. healthy food, good portions, and a community-driven environment make it a restaurant that stands out from the rest.",1
"wow, spinato's well done well done..  okay since i am yelping this based off  my experience it has to be a 4 not a 5.   the food...amazing, got the signature mama...something something..pizza, the one on the top. we ordered it with some italian sausage, since it doesn't come with meat at all. well the pizza came out and it was amazing...but no sausage :( imagine if it had sausage i would have been happy.  the dough was/is a garlic dough which makes it delicious. i really loved the strong garlic essence coming off the pizza. all the flavors mingled together perfectly to create a sensational bite. (um hog the corner pieces if you can, they be the best) the sauce was sweet, which turned it into a different beast of a pizza. either way i loved it, but would have loved it more with italian sausage.  the waitress admitted she forgot to add that to our order and made up for it with a discount.. awesome! she offered we didn't even say eww take it back or anything (because at this point we were too hungry to wait again)  the service was a little awkward at times, but it was great none the less.  their desserts are really good as well, i am no canolli connoisseur, but this was delicious to me...  i would easily blow my paycheck here if they had wings too...but the pizza is good enough for half my paycheck...",1
"i gotta say/write, durant's is a good place to go. it's an experience that lives up to the hype. there is a lot of atmosphere here, folks.  so, come on, enjoy it. it is not the chain joint that we've all grown accustomed to. durant's is a great place to go for birthdays, special occasions, guests, etc... i love the velvet red walls. you don't see that everywhere these days.",1
"had the totally most awesome breakfast here this week. i ordered the southwest omelette, loaded with cheese and green pepperrs, and that was excellent. the potatoes were a close 2nd. i don't think i've ever had such tasty potatoes as a side.   the coffee was hot and yummy and the owner even asked me to sample some new rye bread he was considering taking on. all is all, a fantastic experience. the kids and wife and i will hit it again this weekend.",1
i love the coffee shop!!! it's the greatest for breakfast. i always get the papas grande breakfast burrito with extra salsa. the salsa is so fresh and sweet. delicious! they serve breakfast until 11 a.m. lunch is good too. i like the turkey club sandwich.   try the cupcakes. the red velvet is to-die-for!!!,1
"what i was thinking on the way to los taquitos:  ""i hate that guy fieri.  what a jerk.  first of all, he pronounces his last name all italian, and i am 100% certain that he pronounced it like a full on american all his life until he made it on food network.  then, he gets to drive around and taste greasy food all day.  plus, he looks high as a kite sometimes on air, which probably makes the food even better.  anywhere from 1-4 reasons to be jealous/annoyed with the guy, depending on who you are.""  also: ""i wish god would smite beyonce.  her songs are the most annoying songs i've ever heard.  if there were a way for her to get smacked into permanent silence, i'd be all for it.""  and: ""i can't wait to eat at this place.  street tacos sound delish.  where is it?  wait--this looks like a residential neighborhood.  where the hell am i?""  ultimately i find the place and go in.  there's some floozy outside with a huge rack--only pertinent because she ended up being an employee.  well i guess it isn't really pertinent then, either.  anyway, i'm *wanting* to like this place.  i long to be able to say that i went to a place today and ate food that tasted like pureed happiness.  i want to give this place five stars and brag right and left that this is the place to be.  but i don't.  the service was good--the girl was nice (bc of an earlier review i was expecting the worst) and she told me the street tacos were the way to go.  i got the three tacos, one chicken, one carnitas, one steak (asada).  plus rice and beans.  on corn tortillas.  and i got a sexy-looking bottle of coke.  when the food came out, i was devastated.  where my three tacos should have been, i had three walniut-sized excuses for tacos.  where my beans covered in mexican cheese should have been, i got beans covered in an afterthought of some white cheese (which isn't what i wanted.  sue me).  where my rice should have been there was rice.  1 for 3.  the street tacos all tasted ostensibly the same.  that punk guy fieri on diners, drive-ins and dives on food network made it sound like i'd wet myself with glee upon eating the carnitas, and the lady making the batch acted like they'd be good enough to keep part of the recipe a secret.  they aren't.  that recipe should be open source for sure, so that maybe someone can come along and improve it.  i certainly could.  anyway--maybe it was because he was high as a f*&^ing kite but the food did not taste like magic, it tasted like hot sauce.  and i am all for hot sauce--i'll bitchslap a habanero or two, no problem.  but the issue is that whatever i ate, it tasted like only the hot sauce.  i added green sauce--still the same flavor.  i wanted to be wowed, but instead i thought, ""meh.  i've experienced better.""  which is why you see two stars here.  in fact, i don't blame los taquitos for doing what they do.  whatever is fine by me.  but now i kinda wanna slew-foot guy fieri just that little bit more for telling me that this place was so good.  if you're gonna tell the world what's delicious, don't smoke out first, because i've been there and eaten a piece of my cat's litter and it tasted pretty decent to me at the time.  hardly a reliable indicator of a culinary masterpiece.  a couple of disclaimers: i don't hate guy, i have no idea if he smokes out, i'm not judging him or you, stoner.  but i am judging that very average set of tacos.",0
"i'm not a big fan of best buy.  it's more or less a radio-shack on crack, but without the cool parts.  if you want earphone buds, something for your mobile, or gaming stuff, or appliances and tv's, some computer stuff, this is the place for you.  me, i prefer other big-box electronics retailers that have a much better selection of merchandise and parts.",0
"haven't been to the pollack tempe cinema since my kids were little, even forgot they existed. went with a friend on a friday night to catch a flick, and i have to say seeing the old movie memorabilia  hanging around made me smile.   also forgot how the set up for inside the theater was old school, i remember back in the day when the seats were just 2 rows on both sides of the theaters, maybe that's why now i always want to sit in the center seat!  watch a movie, had a good time, i will be back!",1
"well i hate to be the bearer of bad news ,but i had an awful experience here and it makes me hesitant to ever go back despite the good reviews for dinner and dessert.  i went for lunch with my husband. i wanted to see the menu first but he wanted to just go for it.  it's very cute inside, i loved the mediterranean/romantic feel with lighted orange trees and faux rock walls, wood beams and rustic chairs.  i hate paper table cloths, as they are prone to giving paper cuts and always make me think of macaroni grille.  i was not feelin' the menu but decided to try one of their focaccia panini's with grilled chicken, tomato, avocado and spinach. my husband ordered pasta with tuscan meat sauce.  first we were served flat diet coke and some day old bread.......sigh.....  good rustic bread is sometimes chewy and maybe even tough, but never just crumbles the way this bread did...maybe it was more than day old?  my sandwich arrived and looked ok (notice no picture) after one bite i knew it wasn't good, but i took a few more just to make sure.   the spinach looked to be from a can or frozen, it was really mushy and the green color was looking really more of a brownish.  my husband's pasta was piping  hot and he said it was ok also but had a weird taste to the meat..??  so i didn't eat anymore of mine and when the waitress/manager/hostess came over i told her why (spinach and just overall not good) she insisted it was fresh..............honey please!   maybe last week when they sauteed it but now it was a soggy mess.  i love spinach and i assure you there is no way that spinach was fresh at any time during the last week!  my husband says i need to yelp on my own time!  2 stars for the decor",0
"ummm... drive-thru boba? how can this be a bad thing? well, it just so happens that it can't! thai iced tea, taro, and honeydew too! this place is the best! the lady who runs the counter is very nice and the donuts are delicious! stopped in for a honeydew melon boba and a ham and cheese croissant and my kids spent the next hour munching quietly on donut holes, which was just a reward in itself! the prices are cheap, the service is friendly, and i will take bosa over krispy kreme and dunkin donuts any day of the week! also an fyi, ignore the bosa website - this location does not serve kolache's and they have their own hours which i believe are 5am-10pm every day!",1
"well call me a sucker .i fell for the word ultra.  i bought the living social deal for ultra star theater . thought i had heard it was a nicer theater experience. hought it would be a great date for my boyfriend and i  ,  i mean husband ,  i envisioned plush theater seats , more room , better  high end customer service, etc. like the nordstroms of theaters.  ultra nope!   but the jokes on me , because this was just an average, off brand theater that didn't even serve diet coke ..can you imagine my horror??    the theater was far off the beaten path , not near a major highway or road.and to top it off there was construction all around  , which i know is not their fault.  we had to actually use our iphone gps to get there.   the coupon did not include the movie we came to see, so they nicely added a charge. the were very nice about it , guess it happens all the time.   the theater itself was small and average. nothing to text  home about.  seats were  equal to a new harkins .   but here is the extra bonus that we did not predict... we arrived early and found the best seats and then we were completely inundated with  local seniors. luckily they were on their best behavior.  they sat and discussed the movie in detail after , it was adorable.   all in all a great learning experience...ultra is not always a good thing. lesson learned.",0
"now i am not one to dismiss a good burger joint, one of my favorite foods. this place is cool looking with lots of ice cream options, however i found the burgers to be quite greasy.   i'll pass from eating here again!",0
"i've been to a couple of shows at the lost leaf and each time i enjoyed myself the service is always very welcoming and friendly it is a cute little house with a cool layout they even have a small side patio where you can enjoy the weather or enjoy a cigarette they also have a great beer selection i always ponder where they put their beer... like, it's a small house... with a ton of beer.. i always just see the fridge though lol i had a pumpkin ale one night and i loved it the guys behind the bar are very helpful",1
"8 of us went on the saturday afternoon to celebrate birthdays.  i called ahead for a reservation, i hear the place is small and gets packed.  i should have bought the gps, but i thought i was going to use my sense to get there.  circled a little and found out the street does not go through the glendale library is in the way!  lol!  we ordered 12 pierogi (mixed).  they are so so so good.  we ordered sandwiches, sausages, cabbage wrapped something, etc...  everything was so delicious!  loved the atmosphere of the owners interacting with the customers.",1
"enjoyed a wonderful anniversary dinner last night on the patio. i think the thing i was most impressed with is the fact that there were several large parties--like 10-15 tops--and the restaurant handled it with ease! the kitchen wasn't ridiculously backed up. the servers weren't harried and terse with other guests. in fact, 2 of those large parties were prom kids and i was very impressed with how the staff handled it all. certain italian restaurants in downtown phoenix **cough cough**cibo **cough cough** should come take note on how to handle large crowds while still treating all guests like they are important.   the food was spot on. we started with the smoked burratta for an appetizer. creamy, silky, heavenly cheese topped with smoked leeks and truffle oil...what's not to love? i had the kale salad and husband had the italian farro salad. both were delicious, not overly dressed, and chilled. love that. for entrees, i enjoyed the jidori chicken which was perfect. it was not overcooked or overseasoned and i love the frenched bone in. wonderful. my husband had the creekstone filet. he likes his steak well done and house brasserie did not disappoint. for dessert, we shared the apple upside down cake. the pistachio ice cream really made the dish...the cake itself was just kind of meh....the ice cream definitely saved it.   the patio is beautiful with lots of space and i highly recommend requesting outdoor seating if possible.   while this is a ""special occasion"" priced place, we will definitely keep this one in our repertoire of places to visit again soon!",1
"i hate it when people are like, ""i'm from chicago so i know what a chicago hot dog is!!!""  but dammit, i grew up in a az/nm border town and this place falls way short.  it doesn't really even seem like the food is made in a new mexican style of preparation.  it's more like new mexican as seen through a sonoran filter.  i mean no disrespect to sonoran style mexican food, it's tasty as well.  but the green chile sauce i've had smothered over, and within, various dishes at my fave nm spots has a lot more green chile in it and is not merely a greenish gravy with green onions and pork (or beef).  the essence of the sauce should be green chile and not over compensated, or embellished with too many spices otherwise.    thus, the meal i had at arriba was lackluster.  i had huevos rancheros.  the potatoes were warm and stale as if they'd been sitting for a spell.  the refried beans could have been canned and i wouldn't have known the difference.  even the  cheese was bland.  i've been here twice expecting to be knocked off my seat with a nm/green chile flavor explosion.  no dice, chino.  aside from the cheesy name, if you'd like a step above this substandard nm fare, try si senor in chandler.  they're pretty solid.  and if you want fire, there is always los dos molinos.  arriba, you need work.",0
"my husband and i did not have a good experience here. i saw on the menu online that they have bruschetta, and so i was craving it for about a week. when we walked in, the place was small and very dark.  we seated ourselves, ordered waters, and looked over the menu. the waitress had a bit of a 'tude, and kept asking what drinks we wanted to order. um, sometimes people just don't want to order a drink. sue me. so we ordered a plate of bruschetta and the chicken salad to split. the bruschetta was so-so; not quite what i wanted. we got the salami and pesto, goat cheese and cranberry relish and feta, olive and tomato. they were a bit sparse with the toppings. the salad was actually very good, but i wish they used chunk chicken instead of sliced deli meat. overall i will not be back. i will stick with postino's.",0
"one night we decided to look for a good thai restaurant in cenpho, and upon some searching and previous good reviews, we chose to try the wild thaiger. we started the meal off with the corn fritters. they were crispy and delicious and had a yummy cucumber chutney with them. for my entree, i had the tofu mangone and it was awesome. i love spice, and not just a little, i like a lot, and my dish certainly turned up the heat. we finished the meal with the blueberry kaffir lime cheesecake. it was creamy, cool, and a wonderful way to end a meal. i'm so happy to have found a good thai place!",1
"high praises for the attentive service and friendly staff, but that's about it.  the experience began with cocktails; a fruit martini tasting almost clinical due its unbalanced high vodka, low fruit ratio, and a manhattan ordered with 'only one or two rocks' served up in a full glass of ice. two for two thus far.  the lobster salad, (valentine's day menu) a mountainous pile of frisee with a few small chunks of lobster buried deep within, made for a nice game of hide and seek as i watched my date feverishly pick through the lettuce in search of what little lobster was embedded within.  the cedar planked salmon entree was another huge disappointment.  a good cedar planked salmon should have the aroma, smoke coloring and caramelization of, well, cedar planked salmon.  this was anything but.  this salmon, while cooked properly, was tasteless, other than its normal salmon flavor. now, plop it onto a flat, (non-fluffy pile) wet, soggy serving of cous cous and you've really got a plateful of disappointment.  we also ordered the duck, which was delivered roasted and rare.  so rare, it was like cutting raw chicken due to it being so flubbery. but again, as i mentioned, the staff was extremely helpful in bringing out a new plate of duck, this instead of the kitchen simply heating up the unwanted serving.  after this level of disappointment, desserts were out of the question, but interestingly enough, our server never even offered us to see a dessert menu.  how weird is that? it was like he had esp.  throughout dinner, a woman, (we surmised a floor manager) paced the dining area as if overseeing the staff. too bad she didn't stop by to inquire how our meal was or if everything was alright. another disappointment.  ironically, if you read other yelp reviews of tanzy, nearly all of them feature a management response, either praising yelpers for their high marks, or, apologizing for their less than stellar experience.  tanzy, please, there's no need to respond.  i don't want an apology, or some lame reason why things weren't the way they should've been. i'm afraid that would be much too little, too late. the time for that was while we were still captive within your domain.  what you should do instead is: gordon ramsey your executive chef. make the mixologist sample his / her creations until they bleed vodka out of their eyes. and finally, have the person frantically pacing the aisles put a smile on her face and actually interface with the patrons, asking about their experience... seemingly pretending to give a poo.",0
"i should explain i don't like sushi.  i have tried to like sushi.  i dated a guy many years ago who was really into sushi and he would take me to the best omaha has to offer and show me how to use the chopsticks and mix the wasabi, the whole 9 yards.  i gave it the good ol' college try, and i just can't do it.  my stomach rolls over after a couple of pieces.  well, i think that, combined with the fact that when he purchased his new 7 series, i didn't writhe all over it like tawny kitaen,  made me less appealing.  such is life.  now i'm married to a man who doesn't like sushi either.    what was i saying?  oh yeah!  we had a great lunch at ra between movies.  we each had the shrimp tempura bento box, which came with 4 shrimps, a spring roll, a potsticker, a salad, miso soup, and some fluffy white rice for $8.95.  everything was delicious.  we also tried their seaweed salad which was nice and fresh.  the service  was great too.   we  had a few of their cocktails which if memory serves, were very tasty, but we got a little loaded and then went to see gravity in 3d, so my memory is a little hazy.   it was one of those afternoons.    i thought the lunch was definitely a great deal and would go back for that anytime.",1
"so i went to us egg because i really wanted an omelette. so bad did i want an omelette. and i figured, what better place then a restaurant called egg!  when i got there there was a 5 minute wait at noon, which was fine. i was seated and got my water pretty quickly. i had already looked at the menu and i got the hawkeye. which is chicken, avocado, tomatoes, bacon and jack cheese. i added onions.   it arrived fairly quickly and was amazing! the hash browns and english muffin were really good too. (i mixed the omelette stuffing that had fallen out with the hash browns--yummy!)   however, the service was bad. pretty bad actually. my waitress seemed to almost ignore me. it took almost 10 minutes to get a side of salsa from her after i asked for it (which took forever as well).   then, when i'm not even halfway through my meal she brings me my check. i was sitting there, fork halfway to my mouth when she just sets it on the table, says ""no rush"" and walks away. i don't know how long she's been a waitress but you never bring a check when someone is still eating. certainly not when they have just reached the middle of their meal.  she never came back until (she decided) it was time to pick up the check. i had been sitting there, with my credit card in the sleeve, with an empty plate (silverware neatly on the plate) for more then 10 minutes before she took it.  needless to say i did not tip. which is sad because i'm a 25-30% tipper on average.   so, overall, very good food, very bad service.",0
"i have been to the culver's in surprise and it made me sick beyond reason so it was probably not too smart of me to try eating at this one, but multiple yelpers told me that the surprise one was the worst and that i should try another one - so here i am.  i don't get this place.  the menu is huge.  it is some weird hybrid of an a&w mixed with long john silvers and a kfc.  i wasn't feeling adventurous enough to try sea food or fried chicken so i went with a basic single patty cheese burger, small fries, and small drink.    let's start with the fries.  they are crinkle-cut which makes them look cool but they taste bland.  there is so little flavor in these fries, they might as well have been made of tofu instead of potatoes.  the drink? culver's root beer.  nothing to get excited about and not nearly as good as an a&w or barq's.  finally, the burger.  most burgers come in patty form.  you would expect your burger to have some meatiness to it.  you would expect something juicy.  not at culver's.  here, they give you a beef chip.  literally this is a piece of meat that has been flattened to the size of the bun.  unfortunately, they must have started with a really small ball of meat because my burger was only a millimeter thick and was crispy - like a potato chip.  i have included a picture.  not only was it thin and crispy but it wasn't very good.  the burger was really just a disaster of an attempt at fast food.  i will not go back here.  fool me once...",0
"papago park is a great urban oasis nestled between phoenix, tempe and scottsdale. it's a great way to discover the sonoran xeriscape without leaving the valley of the sun. the enormous red rocks stand as a beautiful centerpiece of the park and offer great vantage points that provide you with beautiful 360-degree vistas of the city. rock-climbing, hiking, mountain biking, picnicking and other activities make this one of the country's finest and most naturally beautiful parks.",1
"this place is ok. defiantly better than places like subway when talking about quality, but not so much better at quantity.   i have been here a few times. the first was a month or so ago after purchasing a groupon. they have a large selection of sandwiches, mostly meat and only two vegetarian options. this is great if you happen to be an omnivore. which i am not. i can only say anything about the madison square garden which i have had three times now. their veggies seem to be of good quality. i just wish that every time i came in they were not out of wheat bread. i don't know if they just don't stock up on it or what but every time i have been in here they have been out of something. cucumbers, wheat bread, avocado. and usually there is never any black tea. some people like to attempt to eat healthy. there is also a lot left to be desired if you do order any of the other sandwiches on the menu. i went with my dad the last time who happens to eat meat, and there was more bread than meat. 10 dollars for a bread and cheese sandwich. come on now. you have pictures all over the place of sandwiches full to the brim with meat and veggies, but then hand you a sandwich that you can't even see the meat on. false advertising. so expect to pay a good amount of money if you order anything with meat on it, but not get your moneys worth.  the servers, if you can call them that, seem confused every time i come in here. they seem flustered, even though its the same people every time, and it has never been busy so i don't know what their excuse is. they don't seem to know the menu very well, or when something does happen to run out. they also close extremely early for a restaurant. 7 everyday except sunday at 5. seems strange. maybe its because they can never keep enough food stocked to last longer than a few hours.  my conclusion: if you have a coupon or are a vegetarian where they put more veggies on your sandwich than anything else and you don't pay as much as you would for a meat sandwich, i would say go. but if you are looking for a good deal, you won't find it here.",0
grab your ankles.......too expensive for what you get!!!  the food tasted great.......we split some dishes.....pork chops.....and mostly pasta.  the food was good quality....but pasta was running $20+ dish.  that's just too expensive for the small portion,0
"i was trying to go to the other location in scottsdale, but since that one seems to be always crowded i was glad that the one in phx has more room.  we came here before the opera, and it was a good option instead of the places closer to the symphony hall. i had a sandwich with fruit salad that was well served, so i had to take the other half for dinner. my other friends enjoyed a mushroom omelet and a build your own brunch option.   good service and trendy decoration.",1
"so.....my wife saw this place on ""shark tank"" and she wanted to try it.  she is a picky eater and usually will not eat sushi or anything like that (she is pretty much anti fish stuff).  she read that they will make a roll with chicken in it so we decided to come here after my burger.  i was pretty full from my burger but i asked myself, ""tim...when are you ever going to eat sushi in phoenix again""?  i answered myself, ""probably never"".  might as well order a roll. this place is like an assembly line of sushi ordering.  you tell them what you want in it, they put it in, roll it, cut it up and serve it to you.  very fast and efficient.   so here is what i got................  i went with a seaweed wrapper with white rice.  to that i added avocado, green onion, jalapeno and shrimp.  they will usually drizzle a sauce on top but i decided to get mine on the side in a cup.  i went with the sweet chili sauce.  my wife got seaweed wrapper, white rice, cucumber, avocado and chicken.  she got hers drizzled with teriyaki sauce.  total for 2 rolls was just over $13.00.  my roll was very good!  i'm not a big sushi fan and if i eat it, i will usually puss out and get california rolls and stuff like that.  my combo of shrimp, avocado, green onion and jalapeno was a winner though.  the avocado made it creamy, the green onion made it fresh, the jalapeno made it spicy, the shrimp made it cool and the sweet chili sauce made it hot.  i don't know if i could have picked a better combo for my things.  my wife absolutely loved hers.  it was exactly what she expected and she says it was a 5 star joint in her book.  service was friendly and efficient!  i would definitely go back again if they ever made one in san diego.",1
"this oregano's location is like the anti-oregano's of the phoenix area.  it is very spacious, there's a lot of available parking, and when i was here there wasn't a long wait for seating.  the food is like any other oregano's location: tasty with large portions.  i'm still a bit dubious of the notion of ""chicago thin-crust pizza,"" when i'm so used to chicago deep dish, and also the fact that the pizza looks like a st. louis style imo's pizza with different cheese.  but, no matter what you get, rest assured you won't leave starving!    i've had pizzas, pizookies, various appetizers, and sandwiches here, and for the most part i've been pretty satisfied with the food.  my latest order was the veggie sandwich, which came with large slices of marinated portabella mushroom, cheese, tomatoes, basil, and lettuce.  even though i ordered the junior size, it was still a hefty portion and i could only finish half of it!  the sweet potato fries were interesting in that they were dusted with cinnamon, adding a sweet dessert-like element to them.  our server was great and provided refills as needed.  i would say out of all the locations, this one is probably the best one!",1
"i feel like a douche bag for giving matt's only 1 stars when everyone else raves about this place and the owner truly is such a delight so in my defense let me explain: this place is a hot spot, every time i've tried to go there, it's packed.  each time, i've never wanted to wait so i went on my way. one sunday, i was just down the street from them at valley youth theatre watching winnie the pooh with my son and i thought how great it would be to take my son to this popular joint for a bit of breakfast afterward.  when we got out of the theatre, it was pouring rain in giant buckets, one of those rarities in phoenix where you can't see what's in front of you cause it's raining so hard.  well, we braved the rain and drove to matt's~ 5 mins. after their posted closing time and yup, you guess it~ despite me and my 3 1/2 year old son drenched wet and  looking pleadingly at them for some warm food and a place to stay for awhile to get out of the rain, they told us they were closed and sent us on our way.  talk about tough standards~ i guess when you are as popular as matt's you get to make and stick by the rules you make. despite that experience, i still wanted to try matt's because of all the applaudes i've heard about the place. finally i made it there on one of those days when i had the time for the long wait and sadly for me, i was sorely disappointed by the breakfast served to me. i had remembered reading some article about the big breakfast served at matt's and that's what i was expecting.  i ordered the waffle with bacon for $9 expecting a denny's portion of food but with flavor and excellence.  the place was packed so i had to wait 30mins for my waffle to materialize in front of me.  when i got the one piece of waffle and one piece of bacon served to me, i thought perhaps while waiting i had accidentally swallowed alice (in wonderland) tonic and was now a giant looking at my rather small serving of food on my plate.  seriously, i almost felt tears come into my eyes, i was so disappointed.  needless to say, after trying so many times to go to matt's and finally getting there just to have not a big breakfast but a are you kidding me?  where's the rest of my food experience, i will not go back there.  it's a good thing too cause it's far from my house and i hate waiting!",0
"another disgustingly huge outdoor mall, complete with jacked-up traffic flow and crazy shoppers.   been here 3 or 4 times. it's such a freakin' long drive for me and offers pretty much what you can find in tempe marketplace, mesa riverview and all other mega retail mini-cities.   if you live in the area, hooray for you. you have a one-stop shopping mecca. if you aren't in the area, don't bother with the drive. it's a mall. outside. crawling with people sweating profusely underneath the phoenix sky.",0
"discovered this place accidentally while driving through after some shopping in the area. so glad we stopped in as we found it was a live music venue!! not many of these around in this area. the night that we were there it was writer's night....for the yet undiscovered musicians. we only had time for a quick bite and listened to one musician who was great. we also took home a list of up and coming shows ..... some impressive musicians lined up. they do charge cover for the more popular shows but thursday (writer's night) has no cover charge. also i believe we were told there was no live music sunday and monday. the food was good can recommend the fish and chips as well as the napa crisp which is brie, apricots, diced jalapeno with a lime honey dressing. only thing i would change is the lighting....too light in some areas .... eyes should be directed towards the musicians when they are playing. we will definitely be back to see some shows as well as check out writer's night again some time....great to have a local music venue! : )",1
"i've visited twice now and have yet to eat...hey i'd rather drink my dinner.  i come from smallis spokane wash and this place reminds me of spokane or seattle.  i'm a fan of the patio, they've even hung christmas ornaments from the trees.  hey, i'm a chick who appreciates little touches that makes the place a bit  festive.  the service both times has been a little slow, but always friendly.  the washington apple shots we had were made to perfection and this is a wash girl talking here.  we parked across the street and i found it hilarious that a 17 year old boy was guarding the lot from vig patrons- ha!  will return to the vig soon for certain!",1
"swanky looking place inside the w hotel --- ooooh...ahhhhh!  let's check out the exotic cars parked outside -- ooooooh...ahhhhh!   let's try out the food............ ..... ..... ..... ..... ..... .....  pretty cool place to hangout if i wanted to be seen with cool crowd i guess (my mom said i was cool....) i didn't think their sushi and rolls were to too exciting. i guess they had to please the crowd and what's hip and cool.  the only thing exotic is parked outside, not on the menu.  pretty basic and mediocre at best. nothing i haven't seen.   service was good overall and attentive.  ambience is like a lounge and smooth.  i felt like i back in hollywood blvd hanging at katana's. - enjoy",0
"being new in town i was a little afraid to find a new eye doc without a referral. i looked around online going through my insurance company's website to see which doc were covered in my area. after looking at the site for cpec i thought this was the place for me.   after going in and experiencing a very friendly staff and a knowledgeable doc with good ""bedside manner"" who addressed my concerns and questions i knew i lucked out in picking the right place to go. dr. thompson and her staff definitely go out of their way to help you with anything you need. i would refer cpec to anyone.",1
"this place is awesome! i absolutely love everything about it- the food, the laid back cool ambiance and the friendly service!   first of all if you can sit on the patio! it is super cute and has a fire pit in the middle for when the sun goes down. this trip, we decided to sit in the kinda outside area/  kinda inside area at one of the community tables.   i started out with a zombie and my fiance had the painkiller. both drinks were tropical and delicious. we got here too late for happy hour but $7 for a stiff drink is still a good price. for dinner i had the hula burger with blue cheese and sweet potato fries. it was a huge portion and really tasty. i loved the maui grilled onions and i especially liked the bun it was hearty and slightly sweet. my fiance had the ahi tuna sandwich also with sweet potato fries. i had a bite of his and it was also delicious.   the people sitting next to us were canadian visitors and said they had already eaten here twice in one week because it was so good. this is a great place to take visitors because its so fun and has yummy food in a great location. i will definitely be back!",1
i went there once a while back and it was dirty and never went back... but if stevey is right about the drink specials i might have to re-visit,0
"oreganos is a fun restaurant and their food is pretty yummy. portion sizes are cheesecake factory style -- enough to share or to take home for another filling meal.   however, the restaurant is really dirty and for this reason i cannot give it more than two stars.  i have been to this location many, many times. more than 20. each time i go there are flies everywhere. even our server was embarrassed and tried to explain why there were flies (apparently it's because i was wearing perfume) and lit candles at 2:00pm to ""attract"" the flies. i spent most of my meal batting flies away from my food and hair. so gross.  after looking around for to figure out why there were flies i noticed just how filthy the restaurant is: there are splatters of what i assume is food on the blinds and a build up of what look like years of crumbs on the window sills, especially in the corners. (the booths that line the walls are next to windows). it was so gross i wouldn't have wanted to touch the blind cord to open the shades without a clorex wipe. ew. i can't believe that this popular of a restaurant doesn't take the time to wipe down their windows -- even just once a month.  i honestly don't think i will be back here anytime soon. i need to forget how grossed out i am before venturing back to this place. it very well could be that the flies were attracted to my perfume but if that's the case why am i never bothered by flies any where else?  on a positive note the service was great.   seriously, just clean the place and find a way to fix the fly issue.",0
"to echo what a number of yelpers have already said, the wings here are, in a word, legit. envision me as mc hammer pantomiming the 2 legit 2 quit hand jive, except i'll add the final move of sucking wing sauce off my sticky mitt. after dining at atl wings, you'll want to do the same.  the best thing about the wings here are that they are crispy and they are sauced right. i won't advise on what's the best flavor, because everyone has their preferences, but you can't go wrong by sampling a bunch of their 14 different wing flavors. you may even find a new favorite. i'm leaning towards the citrus chipotle and the sweet 'n' tangy, but then i haven't tried them all.  a note about the sweet 'n' tangy wings. not really sweet nor tangy... but delicious nonetheless. i would say that these are more salty and sweet, with a soy-sauce-forward note. i found myself strangely addicted to these and unable to quit stuffing them down my grateful gullet.  i pray i will return to atl wings many times and try all their different styles of wings. but that's why we pray... we got to pray just to make it today. (dear lord, that's two mc hammer references in the same yelp review. i am no longer responsible for my own actions...)",1
"yes once again i have decided to give this mediocre place a try ...don't ask me why, i had the eggs bene as usual the canadian bacon was a paper thin slice of meat i also asked for some spinach on my bene for some reason the put raw spinach on ...?????? not sauteed .......i asked for the hash brown crisp and basically got potato chips....i kid u not......good bye crackers im breaking up w/u",0
"out of all the froyo shops opening up, this is my least favorite.  the setup was predictable, the flavors weak.  of course we weren't allowed to get samples ourselves, and we had to ask for someone to help us out.  i felt like i ruined the girl's day by asking for more than two samples.    the toppings bar seemed dirty.  i felt like i was going to catch a virus from the fruit, which looked like it was leftover from the day before.  i had no clue which type of chocolate chips i chose--the hand-written labels were in groups of three along the back row.  confusing.    i'm glad we didn't have to pay full price--thank you yelp check-in offer!  one thing i did like were the chairs outside of the place.  perfect to sit and have a good conversation with a friend.    i'm not going out of my way to come back here.",0
"i am a burger snob. you can imagine the delight when they have a place named for what you love!   cheeburger was good. i liked the options but really didn't go wild. i like em standard. pickles, mayo, tomato, mustard, lettuce. and of course cheese. i asked for medium since they don't to med rare....   the 1/2 lb burger was cooked as requested (sort of) and was a good size. it came with the correct toppings and the cheese, cheddar jack, was melted perfectly.   3 problems   1x the burger was 2x the size of the bun. equal it out a little....  2x they flat top grill it. grill would have been awesome  3x it lacked seasoning, like garlic, onion powder,salt and pepper. i added it once it go to me and it was better.   i would have another burger from here but will not be craving it.",1
"mmmmmmmmmmmm good! the fried chicken here is fantastic.the chicken was thoroughly cooked (doesn't happen every place).  my chicken bread was moist and juicy and some of  the best fried chicken i've ever had. the breading was not too greasy and tasted very good. after i finished my piece, i wanted more!  the waffle served with the chicken is very good! a very nice size and complemented the chicken well. i could do without the the slab of butter, a 1/4 of the butter would do.  the mac and cheese as a side is a definite winner!   i'm a big fan of the drinks coming in a mason jar.  service was good.  i think the cost of the food is slightly overpriced. the 1 chicken breast and waffle was $8. a side of mac and cheese was $3.50.  one side item should come with every meal.   based on how much i enjoyed the chicken and mac and cheese, i'll be back.",1
"i kind of feel like a dick giving this place such an ""low"" rating because out of the two times i've been here, one of them was an absolute blast and the other time i wish i was dead.    so, a fair rating would be more like a 2.5  the good:  they have the coolest spot on the washington drag, complete with rooftop patio that is completely urban and when cityscape comes to fruition will be the ultimate place to view it.    the bad:  however, the owners have completely missed what their target rooftop market should be, and ""dumbed"" this place down with awful djs and a projection screen ... not to mention an completely forced ""vip room"", which seems more like a holding cell than somewhere to put the local celeb dorks that frequent this place.    the good:  the decor and design.  the interior is very classy  the bad:  their current clientle has completely missed the point.  tuck in your fucking shirt, or don't, but do it with some fucking style.  you look like shit and you're making this fine bar with some massive potential look like a dive.    the good:  they have a dj  the bad:  he plays bad hip hop/rap.  i don't mean that i hate hip hop.  the exact opposite, actually.  he just plays all the horrible shit.  would it kill you to update your selection from ""irrelevant"" to ""marginal""?  how about going beyond that to some indie hip hop like spank rock, handsome boy modeling school, m.i.a., or ohmega watts?  how about something everyone knows dispersed in there, like common, jurassic 5, lupe, nas, or outkast?  the music upstairs is straight up boring.    the good:  you can have a fantastic time here with all of your friends  the bad:  you need all of them there to make this possible",0
"best taco shop in phoenix, period!! this place is not just your average mexican/american aka macayo's approach to mediocre mexican food.  this place is as grass roots as you can get! home grown from the state of oaxaca mexico. translation for those saying chewbacca, this is not your star wars flick but it is a very rich and notable region of mexico that produces some amazing cheeses that also somehow motivated a few cats to open up their own taco shop next to a tire shop in phoenix!    try everything in their menu, it is delicious! don't let their location fool you, these guys care about great ingredients like their organic veggies and home local baked tortillas!    i have had them do catering too, the price is ridiculously low and they are just awesome at what they do.. i will forgive them for being closed sunday and monday because great talents do need to rest.  remember if you want macayos or greasy lard infested plates don't come here, there owner will tell you the same because they care about what they do, boss status!",1
"baiz is a great place for your middle eastern grocery shopping needs.  they are stocked with items such as imported mango juice, fresh pitas, a variety of feta cheese, yogurts and kefir cheese, frozen parathas, etc.  in other words, if you need some middle eastern grocery items, you will probably find them here.  the prices are mostly reasonable and the place isn't the cleanest.  but, i still recommend baiz as a top middle eastern grocery market in phoenix.",1
wow.  what a great addition to the mid-scottsdale dining scene.  lots of good wine choices and fun little plates to share.  my favorite was the orrchiete pasta with sausage.,1
"service continues to get worse.. what is it with this place, i am really really trying to like them! they are a great local place i want to keep frequenting, but if i have to continually remind them what's in their antipasto platter.. i should work there!!!  the food is great - i had to take a way a star for service. they seem to be overwhelmed or they just hire staff that are anti social and hate dealing with people.. i feel bad, but it has to be noted.",0
"worst pasta i have ever eaten. i'm not even kidding.   we ordered the fried buffalo mozzarella, pork shoulder & calamari to start .. all of it aside from the pork was blah and unimpressive, the pork was tasty, but the flavor was really strong and i couldn't eat much of it before wanting to vomit.  for our entrees we got the orecchiette alla puttanesca($15)... which apparently has 12 random ingredients from some streetwalkers pantry and last time i checked, a streetwalker is a hooker, so, i mean, if you're cool with eating shit from a hookers pantry, order this, its not good.   we also got the fettuccini tagliatta($19)... rib-eye was a little tough, noodles tasted funky and me and my palate were overall just very disinterested in eating more than 2 bites. also, id like to add that both entrees were not hot, like they had been sitting there for a while. this irritates me to no end.  not only was the meal sub-par, but its was freakin' expensive! honestly id rather bust open a package of safeway brand angel hair and prego from a can - it tastes better anyway.  sorry pastabar, never again.",0
"while the food here was good, i am just not a fan of the long line, the packed atmosphere, and the tight quarters. just don't feel like i had any personal space, and made me feel a bit stressed out, and rushed. i would suggest coming here for breakfast, however i highly recommend to avoid the busy hours.",0
"as a tempe retread (my initials are still scratched into several corners on rural from pavement being poured in 1989 and 90), i am rediscovering a few old favorite places and trying many new opportunities.  last night, thai basil had both star earning and star losing moments.  the ""gotta have thai"" monkey popped up on my back early yesterday.  as the love of my life is out of town for a few days and does not have the same passion for thai that i do, the monkey's timing was good.  since we are now within orbit range, i went to my trusty yelp mobile app and  told it to thai me.  thai basil struck and away i went.  on arriving at 6 pm, there were 5 cars in the lot and on entering, about 20 folks seated at tables enjoying.  the restaurant appears to be clean, though the lighting is dim.  there is apparently a second seating area that i did not explore, so don't hold me to the customer count.  i stood at the door for a moment (in tv terms, a moment is 1 1/2 minutes) and was greeted and seated.  the host handed me a menu and walked away.  i perused the menu for a minute, closed it and started waiting.  5 minutes passed, and i caught the eye of a server who brought appetizers to a table near mine.  she came over and i asked if i could place my order.  she nodded and walked behind the bar, tapped what turned out to be my waiter on the shoulder and pointed at me.  my waiter turned and waved, then walked into the kitchen.  5 minutes later, he came out with his pad and pen.  i ordered som tom, the yardstick by which i measure every thai restaurant, and jasmine rice.  i requested that the green beans and shrimp be left off.  at the menu's suggestion, i ordered thai hot.  he wrote down the order and walked away.  i was surprised that there was no request for a beverage order.  i caught the eye of the server again.  she came over and i asked if i could get a glass of water.  she nodded and walked behind the bar, tapped my waiter on the shoulder and let him know about my desire for water.  he turned and waved, then walked into the kitchen.  5 minutes later, he came out with my som tom, rice and a glass of water.  he asked if i needed anything else, and when i responded no, he walked away.  som tom, properly made, should have lime, chile, palm sugar and fish sauce each of which brings tangy, sweet, salty and spicy notes with the crunch of fresh papaya.  while the portion size was respectable, 2 cups of salad, the seasoning was totally off.  there was no fish sauce or lime that i could detect.  the spice came in at a solid 9 (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), but without all the notes, this was a bad karaoke version of what should be a great song.  i put my fork down and caught my waiter's eye.  he waved, then walked into the kitchen.  5 minutes later, he came to the table and asked if everything was satisfactory.  when i replied to the negative, he said he was sorry and walked into the kitchen.  a moment later, a lady came to the table and asked about my dissatisfaction.  i asked about missing ingredients in the salad.  she grabbed a fork and tasted, then she said it was very sweet.  she offered to have the order remade.  i agreed, and she took the salad to the kitchen, yelling in thai that it was not right.  i nibbled on rice and sipped water while the order was remade.  the rice was ok, not too sticky and not too dry.  on the second presentation, the lady (who i found out is the manager) asked me to taste this version.  i tasted, and it was a saltier version of the original.  i could get the sweet, the fish sauce and the spice, but no lime.  i asked if i could get some wedges of lime and she said she would take the order back and have it remade.  by this point, it had been nearly an hour since i had arrived, so i asked for the order to go.   i finished the rice and water while i waited.  instead of bringing the new order out to the table, the manager waved me over to the bar with a go box.  she had me taste and again, it was below par.  i asked for some lime on the side, only to discover it was juice out of a bottle.  i paid my check and proceeded home.  for the price, $8.95, the time and the multiple attempts, this thai basil is not worth the effort.  the contrasts between thai basil on university and thai basil on rural are kind of strange.  as i have been made aware, there are 5 thai basil operations around the valley...and being an adventurous sort, i will probably try them all.",0
"great spot for a quick after or before work hike.  the popular summit trail has 2 trailheads.  one is on 7th street just north of the main park entrance.  the parking here is usually impossible during peak hours.  i suggest going to the main entrance, taking the park loop north to the top of the hill and parking there.  that pavilion has more parking, a water fountain, and is easy to access.  there is also a park restroom just across the road.  i won't promise it will be clean or even open though.  honestly, i have only used it once.... that was on the 4th of july, and it was only mildly offensive (as far as park toilets go)   the summit trail is short steep hike with pavement the last 2/3 of the way.  i like to go up and back in the afternoon, after work.  sometimes i just go for a run on the loop around the park.    there is also a back way to the summit. the trail for that is near the south end of the park behind the pavilion at the bottom of the hill.  that trail is very rough and easy to lose.  i suggest going up that side and down the main summit trail.",1
"still delicious, and now they have pumpkin foyo that is out of this world!  yummmmy!  i'm so disappointed i didn't get more than i did, but i figured i'd wait to indulge in treats after soma half ironman tomorrow......yup!",1
"even after 2 years, they still deliver a superb burger, and they use grass-fed beef which makes for a high quality and tasty product.  fries and chili are tasty as always, as well as the italian beef and chicken sandwiches. upgrade 1 star!",1
"delicious and inexpensive buffet.  for $7.99, you get your choice of 4 different trays.  sodas here ($1.99) are pepsi product based.  today at the buffet there was tilapia in brown sauce, jerk chicken, red beans and rice, and pasta salad.  the tilapia was excellent.  it was seared on the outside for a more crispy texture and had moist flaky meat.  the jerk chicken was also superb, pretty spicy, with juicy, flavorful, fall-off-the-bone meat.  the red beans and rice were excellent- i went back for 3rds for just the rice!  the pasta salad, just ok, your standard pasta salad.  while it would be nice to have a little more variety, on the other hand, i'm glad that they can excellently prepare a smaller selection of food without compromising quality.  will definitely be going here again!",1
"this place get packed! so i would get there early or reserve if you got a big group. there really isn't much seating, but there is a room for bigger groups. we sat at the bar at this occasion. it's probably one of the few japanese restaurants/sushi bars that is owned by fa japanese family. i feel like most other ones are owned by koreans. (could be a huge generalization but it's true in many cases).   anyways, the service is good. there were two servers and the owner was helping out as well. two sushi chefs at the bar who look like they just graduated from high school, but they knew how to cut fish. thumbs up. i liked the appetizers as we started off on miso soup and seaweed salad. the sushi portions are on the smaller side (6 rolls), but i think the quality is great. the nigiris were awesome and even the rolls tasted really great. they don't go overboard on sauces, so you can taste the different flavors of the fish and ingredients in it. this may not matter to you as long as it taste good overall. also had the fried icecream which were bomb. i don't know how they make these, but i approve.   great restaurant to try out if you are into sushi!",1
"so, i ordered yellow curry with chicken & cheese rolls for an appetizers. the curry i ordered mild and asked to give me some chile paste on the side because i split it with a friend and she doesn't like spicy food. as soon as i saw it come out i could see it was spicy but i took it anyway. it was very spicy not overwhelming but not mild at all. other then the spice there was no real flavor to the curry. there was barely meat i know we split it but we both go like two small pieces. it kinda suck because i have been wanting to try this place for awhile now and now i'm not sure if i'll ever go back.. i doubt if i go back anytime soon",0
"oh...macayos.  a once phoenix staple has turned into complete and utter crap.  i spent many a high school evenings dining here after debate practices and i believe el presidente obama ate here within the past few years.    things have taken a big turn for the worse.  i mean, you shouldn't expect much with their cheesy decor and a customer base similar to that of wal-mart, but it used to be decent - and edible.    their menu got smaller.  its hard to find anything under $11.  the food (even the side of veggies) was sooo greasy and fatty. seriously - i feel like i need to eat salads for the next 2 days to compensate for the calorie content of that dish. the baja sauce lost its kick.  the guac had no flavor. i regret eating here.",0
"what more could you want in a breakfast place? delicious breakfast food, pancakes, french toast, eggs, and good coffee (hard to come by in this type of restaurant environment)!  service is very, very fast. we have been coming here 2x per week lately because we drop my older daughter off at choir practice before school and have an hour to kill before the other one gets dropped off. i can't think of a better way to kill time than at butterfield's.",1
"disappointed... i mean, i expected much more out of this place.    service - not very attentive.  food - average if not slightly below. (should you have to ask for what the menu says it comes with?)  atmosphere - nice, but rather sterile and cold (along with the seats under the a/c)  pricey - yes, for what we got and the rather bland taste (fish & chips / french dip).  will we be back? - maybe - but not anytime soon.    the yardhouse is hands-down a far superior place, service, food, quality and just all around better than bj's.  as simon cowell would say... sorry!",0
"yuck. and i mean that will all gusto behind the word. i absolutely did not like this place. it's very rare that i dislike a place this much. i usually can find something redeeming (like los olivos does have some pretty damn good salsa), but i could not see myself going here ever, ever again... unless my family dragged me here. they, of course, loved this place.   yum. that's what my family said. i asked them what i should say in my review. my dad loved los olivos and said he'd rate 'em 4.5 stars. he only deducted the 1/2 star because they took our chips away before we were finished with them. i guess it was a bartering system: your entrees for our chips.   perhaps i ordered the wrong thing. after all, i didn't want to drown in grease, so i picked the shrimp entree that came with rice. i picked at the soggy rice. i nibbled on the burnt garlic toast. and the shrimp? well, let's just say i wasn't expecting to have to work for my food. i had to peel the shell off myself. ""how do i do that?"" i asked horrified. still a shrimp novice, i had no clue. ""you grab their little legs and pull."" i nearly had to excuse myself to go throw up.",0
food is mediochre at best. service is slow even by geologic time. the micro brew is typical and unimaginitive. on the good side the patio is dog friendly. one star just for that.,0
"against the the recommendation of my friend, steven g., who has already wrote a review, i headed down to this place to try it out.   my significant other was extremely excited to try this place out, specifically, the italian beef. i must say, i was pretty excited too. the service was really good, they all seemed very nice, even the cook was asking us how the food tasted. that's nice of them. b1g1 coupon w/purchase of 2 drinks and cheese comes out to $15 still...umm, pointless to use a coupon, i don't drink soda anyways.  the burger was delicious, well the beef patties were. i got a double, and this place totally reminded me of johnny rockets, but the patties were definitely nice and big. i think its like $6+tax for a double which is a good value, but the fries are ~$2, and its just frozen crinkle cut fries it seems like. this must be a joke, crinkle cut fries are what you get at the school/university cafeterias. i was hoping for something a little bit more unique here. the fries were well done, but i don't its worth getting them. they have this special ""fry sauce"" or ""lobby"" sauce. its a unique recipe, and my significan other was raving about it while we were eating. yeah, it was pretty good, but it doesn't make up for average fries. it does add some flavor to the burgers, and the cold crisp vegetables definitely deserve a ton of praise. however, the bottom bun was super soggy. just plain old, super soggy. the burger patties were just ridiculously greesy, its good to a certain point, but when the grease is owning your buns, you need to cut back.  the italian beef? i heard some guy that was ordering saying it was the best in the valley. i laughed. by the time my significant other got to the sandwich the bread had seemed like it had been drenched in water. it sort of reminded me of a hot dog eating competition, just dunk your bread in the water. fail. unfortunately, this was just a disappointment. i was astonished how this could happy. seriously, i just wasn't sure how you could mess up that bad. its a shame, because i know the cook cared how the food tasted. i really wanted a tasty italian beef, but i guess it wasn't in my destiny.  lobby seems like a cool guy, and maybe this was an off day or something. but i have to be fair, i want to give this place a higher rating, though i can't say it is warranted at the moment.",0
"i feel conflicted about this store.  i've gone there on and off over the years and have over that time spent hundreds of dollars there, but i still feel irked about some really sub-par customer service.  every time i pass it and consider going in, i find that the bad taste still remains, and continue on my way.  the items have range, from the absurdly-priced to the reasonable, from wallets for guys to baby stuff to seasonal home decor.  i have found a lot of cute jewelry pieces which have made great little gifts for gal pals.  some of them have even been affordable.    that said, the owner is particularly rude and snotty.  i purchased a dress there once that i decided was too unflattering to keep once i got it home.  imagine that, a 2x2 dimly lit dressing stall steered me astray!  i brought it back several days later at my leisure and was immediately asked (by the owner) if i had worn it.  i was taken aback but said no, that it was visibly unworn, and the tags were even attached in such a way that to hide them would have been impossible.  she clearly did not want to return the dress yet did so anyway, but only after informing me that, ""we are not nordstrom.""  outrageous!    i like to shop local first as much as the next guy, but this woman can suck it, and so can her business.  your mileage may vary, however, as i have found the service from her employees to be far more courteous and helpful.",0
"oh yes, durant's!  we have been coming to durant's for dinner the last 4 or 5 years. usually when we dine there it is on a saturday night and it is usually fairly busy. i can honestly say not only have i had fantastic meals here, but, the service is always spot on. the decor is old school which i love. you really feel like you stepped back in time with the red booths and traditionally dressed waiters. i love walking through the kitchen to get to the maitre d. it is one of the few places in town where i love dressing up to dine out, as the atmosphere is totally conducive to that. (no worries if you want to go casual -it is my own personal preference when i dine at durant's-something about the atmosphere makes me want to wear a dress.) :)  i love their shrimp cocktail. it is fantastic. i am not even a steak eater anymore-i realize that is what they are known for but i love durant's none-the-less. their fish dishes are really good.  i love their crudites when you are seated-there is something magical about their ranch dressing.  i need to mention the bussers. i drink a lot of water. those guys and gals hustle-they are top notch. my water glass is never empty long and i appreciate that.    nice wine list, and their wines are reasonably priced.",1
"not impressed at all.  the goat cheese fondue was pretty good but the steak with chimi churri and fries was barely an ok. the service was good and the decor is really nice but for the prices, you could do way better.  they're doing a ""latin america food tour"" and it was peru's turn. i didn't have the peruvian menu but my friend who had it was pleased.   i guess i wouldn't go back.",0
"i can't believe nobody has reviewed this place!  it's been a local music establishment forever! joe grotto (hence, the name) is a staple in the music scene here.  he's the nicest guy, too! there is a big floor in front of the stage to get up close to the bands.  behind that are rows of tables for just watching.  to me, it's a bit random to have the tables, but it seems to work for joe's! my guy friends like the hot waitresses.",1
"i checked yelp and saw all the stars!!  i need to try this place and it was by ikea.  plus!!  i got the chicken & my hubby got the steak.  the place smells delicious.  i got the cheese fries.  they have a simple menu, i like it!    ordered and i was expecting greatness.  i was so bummer to taste chicken and cheese.  no flavor (salt and/or black pepper)?  my hubby's steak was tasteless too.  the fries were good, but eat the cheese quick.  when it get cold, it does not taste good.",0
hula's is awesome.  here's why:  1. great name 2. strong drinks during happy hour (actually all times but this place doesn't water them down during happy hour) 3. yummy appetizers 4. tofu tacos (vegetarians rejoice!) 5. outdoor seating 6. strong drinks for $5 - yeah i know i said that twice  my favorites are the pain killer and the blood orange martini.  i'm a light weight so one drink is plenty for me.  also the scorpion bowl is fun to share - emphasis on sharing!  (please don't try one by yourself.),1
"i've been wanting to try how do you roll? since i first saw it last year! i was very happy with my experience! i like the concept- custom rolls or a few choices of their creations. it's a great sushi place to take kids to introduce them to new foods. there's a choice of meats that are cooked including beef and chicken in addition to shrimp, crab etc. as well as the traditional fresh salmon, tuna etc. i made my own roll like a philly- white rice, cucumber, avocado, sprouts, salmon and cream cheese. i order rolls like this elsewhere and it was very comparable in quality to my favorite spots. i got rice bowls with krab and cucumber for my boys and they liked the teriyaki sauce on the side. there are 2 different kinds of lemonade in the fountain and herbal iced tea which was delicious (hibiscus raspberry frenzy) and black passion fruit tea also. they have 5 flavors of mochi- we tried strawberry, vanilla, mango, and green tea- the 3 of us each chose a different favorite but agreed they all hit the spot! we did not try the coffee flavor.  very casual inside with a front door facing 7th ave and a back door with patio. laid back vibe.parking can be tricky, but i lucked out today.   customer service was awesome. very nice staff. i look forward to returning for happy hour with friends as well as with my nanny kids for lunch.",1
"i have to say that the view here is excellent, the food is almost always wonderful... the inconsistancy is the service.  it is a great place to bring friends from out of town, or to bring your parents when they wonder why you live in phoenix instead of wherever they live.",1
"so 4 of 5 times i've been completely f'ed by this damn thing.  first i had an appointment and the train was 20mins late to arrive (and subsequently packed to the gills) and this was at 1pm in the afternoon!   second time we nearly reached the end of the line and the train locked up the breaks and we sat unmoving for 15mins, with not so much as a peep from the driver. turns out they needed to ""switch the tracks"" to allow for another train to get by our train.  the fourth time the train had to stop and wait because they were ahead of schedule (making us late).  then last night we were stopped mid route and told that we were waiting to switch drivers (and she hadn't arrived yet, so we just waited for 15mins).  this is the most undependable mass transit i've ever used.   i was originally sooo excited about this, only to find it managed by chimps.  total fail!",0
"recently went back with a party of 10 for a bday celebration. it was my pick, and i did consider how a party of ten could be a disaster in a small-ish, ""we're just a hole-in-the-wall that happens to be really popular"" place like wt. and sure enough, we arrive and wait in the tiny entry way for at least 10 min before being approached by anyone. in that time, a friend who had arrived early and staked out at the bar informed me that as soon as she sat down, she was told that she couldn't order food because the kitchen was temporarily shut down because they were too busy. at the time we arrived it was maybe 30 percent full, and she assured me that that had happened 30-40 minutes ago, so they should be back on track by now.  the host finally showed up and said she could seat us, but it would be a while before the server would take our order bc they were ""recovering."" well, that's better than 10 people blocking an entryway, so i'm not sure why she seemed hesitant to seat us, even if we had to wait for a server. she assured us that we could order drinks from our table until the kitchen was ""ready."" it was only downhill from there. thankfully, we were a jovial bunch - under any other circumstances this experience would have been disastrous. 15 min to get drink orders, another 15 to get the drinks. another 20 min later he took our food orders. 30 min later they started coming out, sort of. seven entrees came out, staggered over a period of five minutes. but three entrees - all pad thai - didn't arrive until at least 10 min later, when everyone else was finished. i understand not everyone can get food at exactly the same time with a party of 10, but they didn't even come close, and at the time we made our food orders it was at least an hour if not more after their alleged huge rush that shut down the kitchen.  i got the peanut chicken - grilled chicken with peanut sauce, rice and grilled veggies. the sauce was too citrus-y for a peanut sauce and too thick (funny that i complained in my first review that my curry was too thin). chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant. good thing it was only $10. didn't get details from anyone else except the bf, who got the kao pad jay, and kept saying over ""i'm so glad i got this!"" all these issues seemed to be circumstantial (except the chicken dish), but, then again, how long has wt been a restaurant? come on, i'm sure they've dealt with many a saturday night rush and someone (ahem, manager??) should have at least come out to explain/apologize for their issues. don't think i'll go back to dine in - ever.",0
"the last two times i've been to cpk (two different locations) i split the bbq hawaiian pizza (with no onion, of course) with whoever i was with, and both times it was super delicious.  the more recent time, i had a mango mojito which was dangerously good.  the service is average, nothing to note either way.  this is one of those restaurants you can pretty well expect what you're going to get; it doesn't change my life, but it's satisfying and yummy!",1
"what a great addition to the list of ahwatukee food options!  i've been to pomegranate cafe a few times now and have left happy each time.  perfect for that pre-grocery shopping (at trader joe's, next door) meal so that you don't go starving and buy way too much food.  as the slogan states, and everyone else has mentioned, pom cafe is ""indulgently healthy.""  fresh, organic, vegan, even raw food options.  breakfast and lunch, juices, teas, elixirs, espresso, and baked goods.  walking in, the atmosphere is calm and relaxed.  walk up to the counter, check out the chalkboard for the specials and browse a paper menu for the rest.  place your order at the counter and try not to be tempted by all of the delicious looking desserts calling your name.  sit down at a table and they'll bring you your food.  if you feel like helping out and clearing your table, great!  there is a busing station on the back wall.  or leave your dishes there and they will clear it for you.  the staff is friendly and energetic; you can tell they enjoy working there and giving you fresh healthy food and drinks.  i have tried a few different menu items and it addition to enjoying good tasting, healthy, vegan food, the portion sizes are quite generous and very reasonably priced.  i have left very satisfied stomach (meaning, i'm full) but not that heavy ""oh-no-what-did-i-just-eat"" feeling in my belly and my conscience.  feel good and taste good healthful food!",1
"out of the rand approved buffets i have tried so far, this one is my favorite. claire and i met rand here for another leisurely lunch.  we were greated and drink orders taken and off we went to inspect the spread.  there is mongolian bbq, a sushi bar, and all the standard items you would find at a chinese buffet.  everything was hot and fresh and delisious.  the ratio of meat to veggies in the broccoli beef was great!  the coconut shrimp was not too sweet.  the orange chicken was very good as well.  the lo mein was wonderful with the noodles being done just right.  the fried rice has a good amount of egg and veggies as well.  and the string beans had a lovely sauce on them and some nice garlic but not too much.  nicely done!  egg rolls were not greasy and the crab rangoon was very good too.  there was a large array of fruit as well as cookies and frozen yogurt for dessert.  service was great, drinks filled and plates cleared fast.  the restaurant was clean and comfortable.  even when it got busy it did not feel crowded at the buffet.  the prices was very resonable and for kids under 10 you can't beat $3.99! claire enjoyed the fried chicken wings, shrimp, and won tons.  and went back for more!  of course she had frozen yogurt for dessert too! overall all i was very pleased.",1
"ok so i hate to break it to ya yelpers, but this place is really overrated.  my boyfriend and i came here on a busy weekend and waited 15 minutes for a seat (no big deal).  the place is packed full of little old ladies (which makes sense since it is in the botanical garden).  the food certainly fits it's clientele though because it could not have been more bland.  my boyfriend got the fish tacos which were tasteless.  for a taco there was not even a hint of spice. the beans were undercooked as well, but they were the only thing on our plates that was hot.  i got the chicken sandwich which really small and a small side of cold chewy fries.  the only thing that i do have to say that i really loved was my strawberry basil lemonade which was perfectly fruity and refreshing and made fresh to order.  it almost made me bump my review up to a 3 star, but that's literally the only thing i liked this spot.  the service was just okay.  with such a unique menu i would love to have a waitress who explained the more unique dishes and made some recommendations.  our waitress didn't even tell us the soups of the day.  i'm sorry, but for the price you pay for this food you need someone to help you make good choices and even just check in on you to ask how your meal is tasting.  my last thing to note is the price.  without any alcohol, appetizers, or desserts our meal was over 40 dollars for a bland tiny little lunch.  unless you want to stop here for a drink after a day in the garden i say skip it.",0
my friends and i are here because it is attached to the san carlos hotel (where we stayed this weekend).  the food was weird.  typically we love vietnamese and were excited to try thus place but much to our disappointment it is not traditional vietnamese---it is french/vietnamese.   we had the pho.  the meat was chewy and the selection of veggies were minimal.  the broth was just okay.  we probably won't go bak here.  the staff was friendly and attentive.  the decor is nice.  the food just wasn't what i expected.,0
"this place has really gone down hill.  i had eaten here a few times and thought it was pretty good. then we went for lunch and it was  incredibly busy one time we went for lunch with a 40 min wait so we decided to leave.   we went back a week or so later for dinner.  we had an incredibly long wait in the bar that seemed  to last forever even though there seemed to be plenty of tables on the patio.  they sat us inside in a very small room sandwiched in-between the kitchen and 3 large groups of very loud annoying people. there was only 2 of us not sure why were were relegated to such a terrible table.  our food tasted terrible, oily, and the vegetables in my burrito were undercooked.  we didn't finish our dinner, paid and left. i have a pretty strong stomach, but both of us got extremely sick from the food after we left.   if you have to go here make sure you sit outside so you don;t get stuck in one the terrible side room.",0
"this place is random.  r a n d o m random.  i don't ""get"" it. went for lunch, while taking a break from medical testing at the mayo clinic.  this place was empty.  ok, there were a half dozen other people there, but it barely counts with the size of the place. now, i like that there is a stage (guess who thought of doing comedy there???!!!) and that they have live music that promotes local bands.  i am all for that.  but, there comes a point when you can't have the place seem too classy for that sort of thing.  framed pictures of different musical icons are nice, but overplayed.  everywhere else.   it just doesn't work here at compound grill. i had the fish n chips for lunch.  5 nuggets of fish places over a bowl of fries that weren't anything special.  when will people stop serving shoestring fries????  it was cool that everything was served in a bowl made from an old record that had been warped into...the shape of a bowl, though.   service was friendly and attentive.  the manager or owner or whoever he was also present.  i'm guessing because they though there would be a lunch rush. for this area, in n phoenix, so close to the 101/51 and n scottsdale, i would expect a bigger lunch crowd.  without it, i guess shows i'm not the first person to just find the place ""meh.""",0

"i find my reaction to posh similar to will ferrell's reaction to jersey boys in the criminally overlooked 2010 feature film ""the other guys"". it's not great, it's fantastic. you guys totally undersold it! wow, what a restaurant.  actually, the basis for that comparison stems from feeling the need to assuage the fear that ""i'll pay so much money and won't get enough food"". i just bought tickets to see jersey boys in vegas. you know how much the tickets cost? $76/each. more than a 5 courser at posh plus a couple glasses of wine. jersey boys was about two and a half hours. five courses at posh, if you're really enjoying yourself and your company, can easily take that long. the difference is that jersey boys does not feed you (well, it does, but in a different way). point being, going to posh isn't a meal, going to posh is an experience. and, in my opinion, it's worth every penny.  i've been several times, including taking my mom when she was in town from cleveland, ohio. needless to say, she freaking loved it. not that she's an inexperienced diner. she's from new york and considers mario batali a god among men, but according to her, dining at posh was like being a judge on top chef. she didn't specify which judge but i'm going to go ahead and veto padma because she is just unbearable. but i digress.  i've been exposed to foods at posh that i wouldn't have had anywhere else. i don't want to screw up the proper dish descriptions so don't take this too literally but i've had chilled cucumber soup with a lime-chili oil, ahi tuna sashimi with wasabi and soy pearls, mother effin sweet breads (which everyone told me i should mark off but i didn't because i've never had them, and even though i might not necessarily order them, i'm glad i tried them), and of course the creme brulee torched-style foie gras which is quite simply the most decadent thing i've ever eaten. and i've had bacon flavored ice cream. again, i'm sure i'm butchering these courses but it's from my hazy wine memory and just trust me, they were all good.  while i think you would be fine with five courses (it's my typical order..since the first is always a soup or salad and the last is a dessert), more courses is always better. i mean, you're already there. might as well give them as many opportunities as possible to blow your mind. trust me, they will.  if you haven't gone, you should go. you won't regret it. same goes for jersey boys, but that's a different review.",1
"the food at matt's is quite good. my issue is with the service. i'm gluten-intolerant and so i asked for my breakfast that normally comes with potatoes and toast to have extra potatoes instead of toast. i was taken aback when the server said no substitutions were allowed, not even for food sensitivities. i understand that a small restaurant that wants to turn tables quickly may not allow substitutions for any reason, but then they should clearly state that on the menu. i probably won't be back.",0
"what a beautiful place. although we only saw a fraction of it (it was the site of 2012 phoenix devoured), i was highly impressed at all the art pieces we did see. the area was completely spacious and at times, seemed utterly expansive. the courtyard was immaculately groomed, with lots of paths and even the museum showcased some food for the event.   their food options were exceptionally tasty and would be a dining option even if you didn't go to the museum itself. i especially liked the big bang sculpture in the lobby and the giant red dinosaur out front.",1
"a friend of mine recently invited us to join for his birthday dinner at fogo. my initial thought was ""what am i going to be able to eat here?!""  but was assured that their salad bar was ""banging"".  so, alas we arrive and the woman and i hit up the bar while we waited for our peeps.  she got a really great dark beer and i tried to go outside of the box and ordered a melon martini.  it was terrible, but i didn't want to send it back cause it was kind of my own fault.  the bartender, however, noticed my full glass and asked if there was something else he could get for me.  thank you sir!!!  i got a glass of malbec instead, and it was great.  our friends arrived, and we were seated.  it was like a whirlwind of craziness after.  our server twirled on over and explained super fast how the place worked and what it was all about.  he went around asking what we all wanted to drink, and when he got to my lady, he called her sir...annoying.  she clearly is a woman.  whatev, stuff happens sometimes when you're high on meat fumes.  after he was done with our drink order, we all got up to grab some salad.  now, i know that this place is a meat house, but if you're gonna charge me 23 bones for my salad bar, please, make it great!  i grabbed some lettuce and started walking around to see what else i wanted.  there were these huge asparagus piled high, so i grabbed a few.  then i grabbed some green beans, huge beet slices and broccoli, too.  i went to the dressings and was kind of disappointed.  there were ranch, caesar, and what looked and tasted like zesty italian from kraft. boo.  everything looked really good, but nothing was seasoned at all.  i mean, i appreciate being given the option to season my own items, but plain bland everything?  i want some flavor people!    once seated, meat on sticks came from every direction.  it's kind of funny to watch.  two of my dining companions ordered limeades, and no joke, had to ask for refills from multiple people (at least four times!) before someone came by with a pitcher.    the boyfriend of the birthday boy decided to propose that evening, and asked them to please bring the ring out on the dessert plate, and they did so very well.  i'll give them a star for that.  it was cute and sweet, both literally and figuratively.  i just ordered an after dinner coffee for my dessert, and everyone seemed please with their treats.  ugh, then when it came time to pay, we decided that i would put $100 on my card and the rest was in cash.  when someone finally came by to pick up the bill, i explained this.  he looked very confused. so, i repeated ""just 100 on the card and the rest cash."" simple enough, right?  not so much.  it literally took about ten minutes for someone else to bring our monies back and when they did, the guy used all the cash and put the remainder of $61 on my card (i'm just glad is wasn't more than what i asked him to put on)...but still, i serve bro! it's not hard to do!  i was completely underwhelmed by my experience here and do not plan on returning.  at least i won't suffer from any meat sweats.  next!",0
"it really is a shame that i've never written a review about this place.   i've loved the coffee here for quite some time.  personally, this is the best cup of coffee in phoenix.  i don't get the 5 dollar coffee-bombs, i get the traditional old fashion regular coffee with half of it being decaf.  the baristas in this location are fast, efficient and provide decent service.  i have to dock them 1-star because most of them do something that is highly annoying to me.  i hate being called ""girl"".  i'm probably old enough to be some of those kids mom!  i don't look it.  riiiiiight?  hahaha. buy honestly.  excessively calling me ""girl"" when u greet me doesn't go over well.  i mentioned it to one barista.  they are also a little bit more expensive than sb's.  that aside, the coffee is still very good and i go here every week.  tip:  get out of your car in the fall/winter/spring and walk to the side window.  that is always much faster than sitting in my car.",1
"i really have become a fan of this place. i have tried a couple different soups (although like a few others when ordering miso got somethings else once), the gyoza, boba and coffee.  everything is very tasty i just love the beef republic ramen with a bit of sesame chili oil added. for the price it is a good filling meal and when you add the $1 off coupon from the campus discount books its perfect. the gyoza are great crisp but not too crisp and the flavor and the flavor of the sauce is great and at 3 for $2 not a bad little side dish with the soup.  they also make a pretty good mocha which i tried the other day and the boba's are fun but i have only had the thai tea version.  the staff here is very good too they are super helpful if you aren't sure what you want, get things out quickly, if its not packed check in on you (rare for a counter order place) and they are just good all around.",1
"my husband and i have been stopping here on the weekends recently.  the staff is always super friendly and their drinks are great.  i've never like coffee.  ever.  i've tried it a couple times throughout my life and it's just never done it for me, so i've always been a tea girl.  then, my husband and i went to cartel one day and while he was tending to our toddler, i went to put some cream in his iced coffee.  i had a little bit of an overflow dilemma, and there were no towels or any potential clean up devices in sight.  so i was forced to take a sip to prevent the spill... and i was shocked and pleasantly surprised that i actually liked the coffee!  it wasn't bitter or nasty at all.  very smooth and delicious, and creamy because of, well, the cream.  my poor husband only got to drink about half his coffee that day, and then deal with me being wired for the next few hours.  the usual tea i get there is always great, too.  i've only tried one so far, the black mango pineapple (or something along those lines) and it's delish!  mildly sweet and fruity, extremely yummy.    i like the way the interior is designed, with bike tires and interesting photos on the walls.  my toddler loves to look around and inquire about what everything is.  there's never been a long wait and we've been there at different times on weekend mornings.  early-ish, and later towards the afternoon.  never overly crowded, never empty.  we'll be back again and again because now i'm hooked on their iced coffee.  it only took 27 years.",1
"i always give a place the benefit of the doubt when i read such mixed reviews.  if something is stellar, then it is worth paying for..  this was not stellar.  in fact, it was more miss than hit.  we had 4 appetizers - the habanero & pickle was interesting and i would recommend it.  the squid which was mediocre to poor.  the farm bird lollipops were just ok.  the tuna poke was the one dish that was stellar.  we each had a glass of wine and that came out to $70.  definitely not worth it with so many other fabulous restaurants in town.",0
i really enjoy this place and have eaten there several times. they just recently changed their menu but i like the brew additions. the coconut shrimp are awesome and the ahi tuna salad is to for for!  i did have the chimichurri flank steak sliders but they weren't good. our waitress was great and offered me something else.,1
"angry crab shack is pretty much a watered down version of the boiling crab famous in the la county area.  needless to say, give this place some time.  they're still working out the kinks according to owner ron.  he is a good man and i trust he will make necessary adjustments to improve and bring to the valley our first cajun crawfish eatery.    here are some necessary improvements...service isn't the best.  i get it, but that will come in time as management steps up the training.  missing items on the menu...living in a desert i don't expect to have fresh seafood.  the cajun sauce is okay at best too thick and sandy...needs to be broken down more so i don't get a mouthful of seasoning!  more mixing i guess would help.  the food needs to be steamed longer.  i ate some cold corn and some of the items in the middle were cool.  granted cooked, but not hot enough...crawfish baked or any seafood at this style of cooking should be steaming hot and almost burning my tongue when i eat it...i expect that.    the place is decor similar to the boiling crab, but with some extra tackiness and not necessarily a good thing.  it's like an rc cola compared to coke...just not the same.    in the end, i'll wait another 6 months before my return.  hopefully, you'll see a better review.  as for now, stay tuned! - enjoy!",0
"i was so proud of myself for finally getting around to cashing in the $5 coupon i received for running the 10k turkey trot last thanksgiving, which mi amigo's sponsors, and i gotta tell ya, i really, really wish i hadn't. bad food, worse service. the waitress was hot, though. rude, but hot.  i ordered the shrimp & scallop enchiladas, which basically consisted of a couple stale tortillas covered with runny cheese, topped off with half a dozen miniature shrimps and scallops. oh, and a small pile of cold beans and white (white, really?) rice. my date actually grimaced when they brought out the food - grimaced! - and said, ""you're not really going to eat that, are you?""  we were in a drinking mood and surely would have spent good money doing it, but after she brought the food, we never saw the hot waitress again - ever! - and i actually had to get up and ask another, much less attractive waitress for the bill.  here's the best part - they took my $5 coupon but didn't apply it to the bill. a-holes.",0
"we're going to party like it's 1995!  i hope that's what the name means.  oh sophomore year in hs!  fast-forward to the 2000s and bam!  welcome to vintage 95! this place seems like a hip lounge to chill with some wine and why not some dine? live music on friday and saturday nights and the dessert menu is like a sweet kiss to your lips.  specialty wines and a cellar that looks like blast of the past.....way past.  i dig it!  this place is great to hangout on the late nights out.  the patio has a cool fire pit where you can sit around to chat.  the outdoor bar is an extra plus! the place itself has a modern goth look and feel, but don't let that deter you from drinking some more ""reds"" haha - unless tom cruise, brad pitt, and kirsten dunst appear at your table then it's time for the check! - enjoy!",1
"i am so torn between 2 & 3 stars. this new ""vig"" just... wasn't. it just wasn't the vig i'm coming to know & love.  we showed up around 12 or so on april first friday.  parking is a disaster here too. hello shasta. lots of people park anywhere else but the vig lot. at least you don't have to park across the street, just next door.  the door guy does not really check id's. he just looked at us & waved us in.  the architecture is cool. it's open & the ceiling is tall. it's not as cramped. lots of gray, concrete, rust colored metal, & some wooden accents. so, the inside is ok. better than the other vig.  put up a clear, easy to read sign pointing to where the restrooms are! do it now. everyone wants to walk back to where the kitchen is. nope, restrooms are right where the patio starts in the back on the left.  the patio sucks. it's more like an extension of the inside. not as lounge-like as the other vig. it's closed in with tons of glass & block. it's freaking loud out there. everything reverberates. not good. only awesome thing is the fireplace. more people can sit around it & it's really cool looking.  the servers pay attention to you here! are there more of them at this location? i saw our server tons of times & she checked on us at least 5 times, maybe more. that's great!  i ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. i didn't know you could mess 1 of those up. the bread is huge & fluffy. i could barely taste the cheese past all that bread. saving part about that meal are their fries.  - moscow mule was yum :) - glass of next: pinot nior was very good. - trout slayer on tap! my friend has property in missoula montana & was a little surprised it was on tap here. this was my first time trying it. i don't normally like beer. i'm picky with beer. this stuff is good! who knew i'd like a beer with a fishy fruity flavor lol. - tic tac the bartender gave me when i asked for a recommendation was gross. 1. no one orders those. 2. that wasn't made correctly. thankfully he didn't charge us since i hated it.  the people who were there are a lot more casual. older crowd too. not nearly as attractive as the people at the other vig. sorry, but it's true. i watched 1 woman who was so drunk she nodded off in her chair.  dj is a girl, and she's not bad.",0
"one of many of their every growing franchise, kona has been a pleasing staple when you don't quite know what you want but know it's just something.   there's menu items for all tastes, with a heavy asian influence. tonight, i met a post-elopement wedding party. this location had a nice patio with a local guitarist. i ordered the miso salmon salad. i should have asked for the dressing on the side because although it was tasty, a little too much salad dressing. the tofu bits were coated in macadamia and the salmon was cooked just right however.   we had a big party (maybe 15?) and the service was fast and friendly. and to top it off, they split all the checks!",1
"i like seafood. i like pizza. so i ordered the seafood pizza. big mistake. i had been waiting about 20 minutes for it when the waitress informed me that it didn't look good, and she'd asked the cook to start over. it didn't look good? what does that mean? sounded like she was looking out for me, though, so i didn't complain. well, i don't know what the first one looked like, but it couldn't have been good if it looked worse than the second one, which arriving another 20 minutes later, kind of looked like... soup! seafood pizza soup. the sauce (1 part tomato sauce / 3 parts water?) was actually dripping off the plate. i tried to pull out a slice and all i got was soggy crust, because all the toppings, cheese included, slid right off and landed with a splash. the shrimp were mushy, like little bad bananas. the squid (i think it was squid, but i don't know that for sure) tasted like pencil erasers. really gross (that's right, that's no typo, that's gross with a capital 'g').",0
"pattie's is ok, for an old town, neighborhood dive bar, but...$4 for a bottle of sam adams? really?? i know, i know...it's scottsdale. but still. get over yourselves. the night i paid that for my sam's (yes, i went through with it and paid that much), i think there was one other person there - an old man in the corner. seriously. no music, or entertainment. the place was dead. i thought, ""get over yourselves,"" chugged my sam's and left to go find civilization - after contemplating telling the bartender where to stick his sam's (he's actually a really nice guy, so i let it go, but he actually asked if i wanted change from a 5. uh, yeah, dude). $2.50 tops for that, pattie's. the fooseball tables and fireplace can't save this one.",0
"probably the best carne asada and margaritas on earth.    the meat is fresh and a good cut.  it's been marinated perfectly and grilled over an open flame shortly within your order being placed.  i was hooked on the first bite.  the salsa is so fresh and delicious.  the perfect amount of spice and sweet and you can tell it is probably freshly prepared daily.  don't even get me started on the jamaica margarita.  it is so damn good, i wanted to bathe in it.  i ordered two of them the first time i went.  i girl behind the counter came out to ask me if the margarita was good because she had just made the batch fresh before i came in.  i told her the only problem was the glass was too small.  you have to try this place.  everyone i know loves it and i didn't know it even existed until a few months ago.",1
"this place is odd and seems to be run kind of hap hazard. i've been here one and a half times: once for dinner, and once attempting lunch but we didn't stay. the dinner was pretty good. i had the steak salad and it was good, but over-priced for the amount of steak. our server was actually the best part of it- she had good recommendations and we were trying to make a movie, so she had us in and out in time to make the previews. other than the salad, we shared an app, but i can't remember what it was. meaning it was probably average. my husband had the pork sandwich and said it was really good. all in all, decent food and good service. ambiance gets a d- it's like eating in one gigantic, loud, dark room with no decor. i can't remember the decor or style in there either. the only way i can describe it is dark and dark.  the lunch we attempted was after we tried to hit true food at 1p and there was still a 30 minute wait. my friend and i both have little ones and weren't interested in waiting in the 110 heat for lunch. we walked into an empty tk's and sat down...only to find out they were out of high chairs. yes, it was empty, save the one woman with her one child and the three other high chairs she was saving for friends. not only does the place apparently only have 3 high chairs, but there was zero attempt to accommodate us otherwise. no offer of boosters, no apology, no nothing. just a shrug and a...and that was it. so, we left and probably won't be back. there are too many great places to eat at the quarter to waste your time on this one.",0
"i ended up here randomly one weeknight for dinner. my friend and i were seated at the sushi bar. i don't expect the best service at the bar, but it was almost impossible to order a drink.  the decor was nice, but the sushi was overpriced and you didn't get a lot for what you paid for.   my biggest complaint was the sushi bar itself. it was too high and had tin foil blocking the display glass. i mean what is the point of sitting at the sushi bar if you can't see the sushi chef making the sushi.   i haven't eaten in the main part of the restaurant, but i would not recommend the sushi bar.",0
"its a bar in an airport so they kind of have you over a barrell. the bartenders are usually pretty friendly. the prices are over the top and the food is not so good. i'd say what do you expect its in an airport, but i have had good reasonably priced food in airports...just not in phx sky harbor.",0
"i'm starting to loose track of the number of times i've been here.  ever since the bartender at my florist told me about this place, i've been here with something resembling regularity.  between the overall ambiance, the mostly comfortable seating, and the very good service, this place is a true gem in the valley.",1
"claim jumper is one of those chain restaurants that gives you giant portion sizes, but the food really isn't anything to rave about. i went here with a few friends last saturday after we had our comprehensive exam and it was just alright. i really wanted to order a soup and salad, but that lunch special is only offered on weekdays (which is weird...people don't want to eat something lighter on the weekends? hmmm) and in order to get soup and salad, even ordering the smallest portion sizes would have been around 13$ (which is ridiculous). so i ended up ordering the tomato flatbread appetizer and a cup of the potato soup. the flatbread was fine, nothing to get too excited about, but not bad. it had sundried tomatoes on the top and was a little garlicky. the soup, on the other hand, was not good. it was the weirdest tasting potato soup i have ever had. it had carrots in it and it just tasted almost sour. it started to separate (i could see the cream and the grease) before i stopped eating it about halfway through. my friends got sliders and sandwiches, which i guess is the way to go here  because they said it was fine, i just wish they had some half portion options or smaller salad/soup options for more reasonable prices for the kind of restaurant this is....a national chain.",0

"i'm not sure why everyone raves about this place...i went with a friend yesterday, and the place was packed! we barely got a parking spot. she had never had pho before, so i wanted to take her to a place that got high reviews so she would have a good experience. the restaurant is very cute, it is in an old house, and is very 'trendy' looking. we were seated and given water and then proceeded to wait for a long period of time before the waiter came around to take our order. when he (finally) did, he was nice enough. we ordered the pork spring roll to share and we each ordered pho ga. i have had fresh rolls before (a lot of them), and this one was just not that great. it was mainly comprised of lettuce, with a little bit of chewy pork bits and a few noodles. other (more hole in the wall type places...aka authentic) places fill the roll with more of a balance of ingredients. also, the ends of the fresh roll had very thing rice paper, making it hard to chew and swallow and felt like a piece of rubber in my mouth. not awesome. so our pho comes out and it looks weird because the broth is clear....almost like water. i have never experienced this before(and i have eaten, and made, a lot of pho). all of the toppings were fresh, but they didn't add enough flavor to save the bland broth. additionally, the noodles used are thicker, more spaghetti-like noodles than the typical thin rice noodles found in pho. the whole thing was just not flavorful. it felt like the broth was not homemade, and if it was, was missing all of the spices that give it such a unique flavor. to top it off, this place is way overpriced. we paid 23$ for lunch, and it wasn't good. i would recommend finding a little whole in the wall pho place in which the employees speak little-to-no english and trying their food. skip this pretentious 'trendy' spot.",0
"my wife and i were hanging around scottsdale for the day and i pulled this place up on yelp. the reviews made it sound like a good choice for dinner so we stopped by.   it was surprising that at 6pm on a saturday night, we were the only ones there. i wasn't overly impressed with the speed of getting our sandwiches, but maybe there was more prep that went into them than i thought. from the time we ordered it was about 15 minutes until we got our food.   my wife got a grilled salami sandwich. judging by her ""it's just ok"" reaction when i asked how it was, it wasn't really anything spectacular. i had the pastrami sandwich. judging by the reviews for this place, i figured that would be a good choice. maybe it was bad timing (end of the day?) but this was probably the worst pastrami sandwich i've had in a long time. the pastrami was pretty dry and lacked flavor. the bread was a little stale tasting but wasn't horrible.   i doubt i would come back to this place. there are a lot of better options for food in the area. if you're really craving a deli, it's not a bad option, but don't go out of your way just to eat here.",0
"its a shame that this place put the improv out of business. that laughs that i had here were not enough to make up for the outrageous drink prices and poor service.   first off, we could not get a straight answer from anyone about what the policy on drinks from copper blues is - we were told different things by the box office staff, the hostess, the bartender at copper blues, the person seating us, and then our waiter - they each had something different to say!  i think the outcome of everything we learned was that you can go order drinks yourself at copper blues and bring them in, but it doesn't count towards your 2 drink minimum - and maybe if your waiter is in a good mood (ours wasn't) they will get you drinks from copper blues.   the venue was cramped! the theater was maybe 40% filled but we still had to sit elbow to elbow with people we did not know. they chairs are uncomfortable and i was playing footsie all night with some woman i did not know.   in addition to the ticket price, you will have to purchase two overpriced drinks.  my iced tea with refills was $10. $10!!! for boring, plain iced tea that took 15 minutes to refill!! for $10 iced tea i would expect it to be made out of some rare tea leaves that were picked by princesses.  my darling darling date ordered a $6 can of beer. the drink minimum wouldn't be so bad if you could get drinks from copper blues (as they have a wonderful selection!) but at stand up live you are stuck with things like coors, miller, corona and a can from san tan. whoop de do.   and then they have the nerve to add a tip on to the bill!  so, to recap: 1 iced tea + 2 cans of beer = $27.50",0
"super cute ambiance. we came for take out after prime lunch hour, so it waspretty dead. the girl who greeted us and got our food was pleasant. because we had never been there, my friend and i did not know how things worked, ie. where to order, what to order. the girl seemed confused by our confusion. after a few awkward minutes trying to decide, we ordered gyros and sides. we waited for couple of minutes and got our food. the gyro was awesome, maybe the best i have had. my side salad was excellent with big chunks of feta and yummy greek dressing. my only negative comment is the price. the gyro was $6, not bad. $2 for salad. and i had a soda and my bill was $11. $3 diet coke? seemed a bit steep.",1
"i went here the other day, as i had a deal chicken for this place. i used to go to a really good salvadorian restaurant in seattle, and was excited to see there was one right near where i live now. so the bf and i got here at around 8 at night on a sunday and it was actually pretty busy. this place is in a tiny strip mall that does not look like it gets much business, and i would have never seen it from the road, so it must be good to still be in business. so i ordered a pollo pupusa, a carne asada pupusa, and a polla tamale, and the bf ordered two bean and cheese pupusas and a carne asada pupusa and we split the pastelitos con papas y queso. well, the pastelitos were pretty tasty, like fried mashed potatoes, and they came with a spicier cabbage slaw which i liked a lot better than the regular cabbage slaw for the pupusas. all of the pupusas were really good, my real problem was with the sauce. the red sauce that came with them was just kind of flavorless. the place i used to go to had some really good red and green sauces for the pupusas... it was kind of disappointing. also, about 5 minutes after we got the pupusas, the waitress came by and said 'oh i forgot to tell you we don't have any tamales.' well, that kind of sucks, why did it take til we were already in the middle of eating to tell us? also, it screwed up the amount i was trying to spend (since i had 20$ to spend on the deal chicken) which i guess shows that this place is cheap, which is good, but for this particular trip that wasn't good. so we decided to order a dessert to replace the tamale. we got the empanadas de platano with sweet cream. so this was a big deal for the waitress, she had already totaled out the bill and for some reason it was a huge deal to add a dessert at the end (which i thought was weird, but felt guilty about giving her extra work). anyway, the empanadas were ok, but i've had better. the sweet cream is in the middle of the plantain and it isn't all that sweet. oh well, i would definitely come back here for some yummy pupusas and maybe try a different dessert next time, the central american quesadilla looked pretty tasty....",1
"i need to give culver's a high five. i normally don't go to culver's for lunch since it is crazy busy and packed with the honeywell and cox crowd. but today i braved the crowds and must've had that ""get out of my way idgaf look since i didn't have my breakfast today vibe"" since i zoomed to the front of the line and ordered right away and even found an empty table.   i was in need of a fix and had a delicious and juicy double cheeseburger with all of the fixings. the cheese was actually melted on the burger, did you hear that mc donalds and burger king?   culver's is more than a burger place. i also really enjoy their hot ham and swiss cheese sandwich (think grilled cheese but add the ham). occasionally i'll eat the fried fish as well. my wife swears by the turkey blt sandwich. if you have a couple of bucks left over, try the ice cream sundae or any other of their dessert concoctions.   services is always spot on. so i think the menu is diverse enough to satisfy everyone in the family, plus it's very easy on the pocketbook.",1
"wow. it's not often i give a place less than three stars unless i had a real bad experience there, like shit service, huge wait or a cockroach in the pudding. in this case, i'll make a unique exception because i encountered none of those. confused? read on.  the wife went here last night and grabbed dinner on the way to meet me and the kid. it's. just. chicken. strips. how can you make any sort of chain restaurant based on that? it's bland and literally the most boring meal i've ever had. just one (small) step up from a glass of water in flavor. let's break it down: tasteless chicken with breading that makes even church's, arguably the blandest food in the state, taste passable; shoestring crinkle-cut fries - like del taco's but half as thick (why?!); boring coleslaw; boring sauce. probably the tastiest thing in the box was the soft buttered toast, but hell if i can't make that myself at home, right? it's just so absolutely pointless to go to this place. go anywhere else. mexican, burger, whatever. i'd rather eat airline food, seriously. i felt like i needed to dip the damn chicken in sulfuric acid in the desperate hope that that could revive my clinically dead tastebuds five minutes into the meal. and chicken strips are all they had on the menu, with the sides as mentioned above! i was still vaguely hungry but quit eating my caniac with half the meal to go, it was that un-special. chick fil-a is a dozen orders of magnitude better than this place. at least ~they~ have some sort of flavour. making different kinds of breading available and giving the option for dark (== flavour) meat chicken would go a long way towards getting this place an extra star. making three, in case you aren't counting. i appreciated the high-rating reviews i read prior to going here - additional reviews from those reviewers will help me profile restaurants i will never eat at and save me a crapload of angst and cash in the future. but take your kids here. they'll love it. it's why i gave it one more star than i was planning to.  about a pound of half-eaten meal went into the trash last night. won't ever happen again. wife, it wasn't your fault, it was mine. and yelp's.

"what is the big deal about this place?!  it's not great, but pretty good. not bad, but ok. just is what it is. we had some wings and a stuffed pizza, and the wings were undersized yet pretty flavorful. the pizza, i just don't understand the hype. maybe i've had giordano's, gino's, and lou malnati's too much in chicago but this place just wasn't it. the pizza is okay, and just okay... if nothing else, way too salty. after a while, i felt like i was consuming a salt lick.  service was weird, and i'm pretty sure our server was on coke. the restaurant was packed and the place was buzzing and he came and sat at our table and started shooting the shit. it was very bizzare. we got someone elses order of wings, and didn't know they weren't ours until the server told us (after we had eaten them all) so we felt kind of bad.   i'd go back here again but i wouldn't really be too eager to.",0
"this was a very mediocre experience for us, and i'm more than a little annoyed that i wasted a good friday night dinner out here.   this place gets one star for the bread starter: that stuff was awesome and we plowed through two baskets. i could have sucked down that whole bowl of peppers in oil.   another star for portion size...as opposed to stingy giuseppe's, you actually get a full plate of food for your seventeen bucks.   reasons we won't be back: 1)we got seated right away, our waiter brought us water, menu, bread, and then we watched him say goodbye to joe and walk out the door. shift over? who knows. we waited for a good 15-20 minutes, with now-empty water glasses and bread basket, while no one came to our table and joe and his family were schmoozing around the room. we finally flagged down a busboy and he got a waitress for us. no apology, no nothing. we also overheard the table next to us complain about having to wait a long time for their appetizers (different waitress!).  2)the food was really bland and nothing special at all. i got the raved-about spaghetti and meatballs, and all i could think was how i was spending all this money on pasta from a box topped with sauce from a can. bland, bland, bland. and the meatballs: yes, they were huge, but my husband's comment when he tried a bite summed it up well: ""mmmmmm liquid meat."" the meatballs have the texture (and almost the taste) of grandma's fluffy matzoh balls, which is great if you're eating matzoh balls but just plain weird if you're eating meat. meat is not supposed to be fluffy.   too many great  restaurants to try for us to frequent this one again. subpar food, bad service...no thanks.",0
"went here on a recent saturday afternoon with some family while we were in the area.  i had looked for a local sandwich shop on yelp and was pleased to have  found this spot... hell, it was close enough, so we gave it a shot.  the buildling is an old gas station i've driven by many times before ... never would i have thought that it would be creatively converted into a small sandwich and coffee shop... but i'm glad it did!  the small outdoor patio had a few people there (and some pets) and the indoor seating area was small but empty enough that we found quick seating.  the table/chairs were a bit awkward (a bit wobbly), but we made do.  we all had sandwiches (i the curried chicken sandwich - how have i not had this before, it was outstanding in flavor!! and my sister's whose sam'ich i also tried was the deviled egg - also delicious) and afterwards we decided that, with the unique selection of alternative-ingredient baked goods they had on display, we'd try a few out.    when we had first walked in, this girl's big, fat delicious looking cinnamon roll had caught my eye.. and after lusting after it throughout my meal, i decided i'd go back to the walk-up counter and get us one to split... waa!  they were all out!  bummer... but, we tried their spice cake and their danish and they were excellent.  i will be back again for sure!",1

"came here one night with the girls after a work event. worst old town experience of my life! my issue isn't with the club, it's fine nothing great, but with the staff. i was dancing on the bar next to a randomly placed iphone at one point. some time later my friends and i are taken out of club to all be questioned on disappearance of before mentioned iphone which i guess belonged to one of their bartenders.   several member of security said i did it and started asking me where it was??? one problem! i didn't have it! i didn't even have a purse or pockets. i was carrying a clutch and wearing a pretty skimpy dress. well they said they had me on camera doing it and they were going to call the cops. lets just say my night was ruined and i started crying and getting more mad. finally some other girl confessed to giving it to someone because she almost stepped on it. what a disaster!   thanks pcl! never again!",0

"after 5 years in phoenix and so much anticipation of trying coronado cafe, i was extremely underwhelmed. nothing was bad. nothing was stellar. i didn't hate my meal, but was more perplexed by raving reviews after such a mediocre experience.  we kicked off our dinner with the infamous crab cakes which were delicious no doubt. that's where the enthusiasm ended. having enjoyed them so much i decided to order the crab soup of the day which had a tomato and vegetable base and threw in a half greek salad for good measure. my other half got the cheese burger. the soup tasted old and had no special quality to it with mushy veggies and completely pulled apart crab strings that made this like a tortilla soup without the spice. the salad was served on basic yellow romaine with no distinguishing qualities that set it apart from souper salad or olive garden.  for $11, i can't say i was thrilled. my beau's burger charted the same on his satisfaction scale - nothing to write home about.  the people were very sweet and the ambiance was cozy, but the ambiance was also...quiet. very quiet, like empty quiet.  perhaps brunch is bustling on weekends and the different menu poses more potential. but we won't be back for dinner.",0
"i obviously have bad mooshu when it comes to comedy clubs! i attended the ralphie may show last night with my sister. the experience altogether was not even an a-ok it was kind of like a meh.... we arrived about 40 minutes before show time just incase there was a long wait line, but to our surprise we got right in and were seated. after we sat for about 15 minutes more people were sat around us and were attended to right away by different waiters. our waiter finally came over and gave us a menu to look at and told us he would be right with us. as he returned to take our order, his very strong personality on asking us ""are you sure you don't want this?"" (each suggestion was an alcoholic beverage) i finally got to a point and had to be sterner with him and repeated our original order, which indicated just drinks no alcohol. he finally backed down, took our order and went to put it into the computer system. it took quite some time for us to get our drinks, people who sat down after us, were attended to first received their drinks and their food order before we even got our drink order. my sister and i were looking around for our waiter to ask politely if we could get our drinks, when i believe a manager came up to us to ask if we needed something. i thought it was very generous that he came over to attend to us, after we spoke with him briefly our drinks finally arrived and we were able to put in our food order. we received our food order a lot faster than our drink order which was nice, but also frustrating for we got there on the early side to eat before the show, the show started as we received our food and where we were sitting we had a hard time seeing our food to be able to eat. this may not be a big deal for some, but i like to be able to see my food when i cut it so i don't spill and make a mess. my sister ordered the chicken sandwich which she was not happy with for she felt it was quite dry and tasteless; i ordered the friend cheese and wasn't blown away but not upset. the food is what you would expect out of like a small dive bar.  there wasn't much more for our server to do after our 2 drink minimum and dinner, but he was polite to check on us through out the evening. in the middle of ralphie may's set i got a text and i needed to leave to attend to my child, so we needed to get our check so we could go. my sister asked our server for the check and he insisted that he couldn't take care of it right now that we needed to check out in the lobby area. my sister was confused and said ok and relayed the message to me. i have been to a few comedy clubs and i have never heard of that, but we thought this might be new, ok let's just get up and go out into the lobby. as soon as we both got up and left a security guard turned and looked at us as if we were trying to skip out on the check he flagged our waiter down asap and he came running out the door. our server walked up and asked if something was wrong and i repeated what he said to my sister. he said there was confusion and that he would get our bill printed right away. i asked politely that we were in a hurry for i had an emergency and needed to leave. we received our bill and it was wrong, he had added a few of the alcoholic beverages from the couple that shared a table with us, so i am thinking it took such a long time to check out because he had to correct our bill. after finally receiving our correct bill and card back he handed us the papers and said ""just so you know we already have a 15% gratuity added to your bill, but i only get 10% of that so if you like to leave extra that would be great, you don't have to if you don't want to but i just wanted you to be aware."" this kind of irked me the wrong way because our service wasn't great in the first place and i am a generous tipper, for i usually always leave 20% when service is good. just the way he went about it made me feel awkward and was a little unprofessional.   on a good note when the show started it was nice to be able to hear and see the comedians. some clubs don't do a very good job at making sure everyone has a good seat and their sound systems are not that great! also the remodel of tempe improv is quite nice! they did a very good job at sprucing the place up.",0
"we were just there again last night. again, they blew our expectations away.  seriously, if you are looking for fantastic food, some good beer and being taken care of by people who care, you're probably not going to a grocery store. well... you should be going to *this* grocery store.",1
"my family stayed here this past summer while visiting me and had a great time.  it is a little pricey but it really is a beautiful property and they take good care of their guests.  the pool is a nightmare in the daytime as it is filled with scottsdale's finest (most obnoxious) rich kids, but other than that it is a fun place.  the restaurants are nice and the staff is very friendly and professional.",1
"a vendor two doors down suggested i try this spot for lunch.  a nice, little local establishment. i got the pepper turkey sandwich and broccoli cheddar soup.  portions were a good size and it came with a homemade cookie.  the price was on point.  the rest of their baked goods looked awesome.  a little bit of a wait for a soup and sandwich and it's cash only but if i'm in the area, i would definitely stop by again.",1
"absolutely amazing father's day brunch!  bread, wedge salad, filet benedict on buttermilk biscuits with hash brown potatoes and green beans, new york style cheesecake = $29.99 + they gave me a $25 gift card to come back for dinner!  thanks flemings!",1
"apparently developers have decided that the outdoor shopping mall is going to replace indoor malls, which is great when it's not summertime in arizona. even so the high (three story) buildings at scottsdale quarter provide enough shade that you can still go there in the heat.    while it's mostly national chains, it goes to four stars because of the inclusion of some local restaurants and the valley's only nike store. it also includes one of two lululemon stores in the valley, an apple store, plus chains like h & m, urban outfitters, and others.  the parking garages at each end of the strip are convenient and spots are generally available although i'm sure they are crowded during the holidays.  all in all, a nice shopping addition to north scottsdale.",1
so i finally tried it and it was ok we had the baked spaghetti plate that guy had on ddd ....um not all that ...so dry there was not enough cheese or sauce. it was nothing like it was on tv it was like dried block of spaghetti. but what i did like was the italian stalion pizza. now that was the best thing served that day. my son got the spaghetti with sausage ....no flavor whatsoever.  we ordered the cheesecake at the end and those fried dough balls covered in powdered sugar. then the waiter forgot about us. we ended up getting those dough things for free. i have tried them before at an italian festival and the were so light and powdery delicious i thought i was going to experience that again. nope... the dough was chewy cold  and gross. basically fried pizza dough. well i can say the carmel drizzled cheesecake was bomb.  i say go ahead and try it you may like it then you might not. that's my review for this place. i think they did their best for guy and food network. not for me,0
"wow, this is the nordstrom of the car world. there is no better place for customer service. they will fix your flat, rotate your tires,all @ no charge if your bought your tires with them. they always fit you in no matter how busy they are. they come out to the car of each person to see the problem and it is always ready when they say. they are always friendly and willing to explain anything. i recommend this place to everyone that talks about tires. love them!",1
"my friends kidnapped me for my birthday (yes, because they are wonderful), threw me in the back of my friend jill's van and rushed me off (blindfolded of course) to radio milano.  my friend lindsay knew i had been dying to go there (i love postino--same owner and across the street--so i just knew radio milano was going to be amazing).  i've never met the man that owns these restaurants: la grande orange, postino, radio milano etc (lindsay apparently once did, lucky girl) but whoever he is, he is a business genius.   the atmosphere of radio milano was sophisticated and classy without being uptight.  everyone was extraordinarily nice and helpful.  true to form for this restaurateur's style, there is a large vase of (fresh every day) flowers that compliment the warm glow of the restaurant in general.  our server welcomed us with what were presented as ""italian potato chips"" and a delicious dipping sauce.    the homemade ginger ale is so strong in taste, really good.  i ordered the special for the night which was a vegetable lasagna.  it was soooooo good.    i'm glad i have such awesome friends to kidnap me and take me to great places.",1
"there aren't many places in south phoenix for lunch, but this is one of them - if you even know about it. located on a golf course next to the golf shop. always pretty good service here and food is decent. the sandwiches look good but i have only ever had salads.   must try the course soon!",0
"my boss, in his infinite wisdom, decided to compete in the battle of the bone wing eating contest.  so, in a show of support, wearing custom t-shirts that proudly proclaimed ""team guza"" we descended on the poor, unsuspecting native.  normally, native is a place i can take or leave....but i have to say this one really did a great job.  they were busy and crowded, kupd and the bud light girls were running around, there were people everywhere, yet our server managed to keep up despite being clearly understaffed.  i ordered a burger and fries, and of course it came while the wing eating was happening.  now, maybe it was flavored by hunger and the thrill of watching grown men stuff pounds of wings into their gullet, but even cold, that was one terrific burger.  even the rapidly cooling fries were awesome.  sad to say, the food was the highlight, as my boss was soundly beaten, coming in 7th out of 9 - he did manage to eat 1 lb 7oz of wings, which makes me just a little queasy.    this was the best experience i've ever had at a native,and would be willing to come back to this one again.",1
"wandered in here quite by chance on a friday night. we had been at rusty spur most of the evening. got out to wandering around and found ourselves here, after initially passing it once, we returned.   such a small down to earth, charming spot with a few tables and about 8 stools at the bar. it had a crowd of mostly regulars, but being that is was such a small place it wasn't crowded while we were there. they had a small flat screen in the corner playing the suns game and several people popped in to pick up phone orders and take food to-go.  seeing that we decided to supplement our liquid dinner with a shared chicken strip plate. over all it was good, the chicken tenders and the fries were cooked to order and they served with our choice of both bbq sauce and ranch. hit the spot.   service was prompt and very friendly (sorry but i can't recall the man's name who was tending bar...my attention was elsewhere). but i would be sure to go back when he was working.",1
"maybe i'll delete this when echo uses their website to accurately depict when lunch is served.  i walk in at 2:06 under the wild impression that lunch is served until 3 (""first, the lunch menu is offered from 11am to 3pm"" - echo website) and am informed the kitchen closes at 2. i promptly feel like an ass hat for bothering to do my homework, but am too hungry to question it. rather than seeing if they can find the virtue in their hearts to push the newly established limit by six minutes, i high tail it out as fast as my car can get me to d'lish.   disappointment can often be remedied by a good tuna sandwich, but i wanted that disappointment to be nonexistent and that good tuna sandwich to be from echo. life is hard sometimes... this does not need to be one of those times.   update the interweb page, y'all.",0
"thought i would stop by here for lunch. i'm not sure if it's because it's new years eve or what but pretty much the whole city north area was dead. it gave me a weird vibe....but my good soup was worthy of the ghost town atmosphere.   in my opinion, press can definitely replace starbucks at all these scottsdale/phoenix shopping/dining/living areas.  plus they actually have a lunch menu that is worthy of sampling, so i was psyched!    they had 2 great soups....i had the roasted red pepper and gouda bisque. the gouda totally calmed the red peppery-ness down, yummy! they had a great selection of not your average sandwich- sandwiches. naturally i had to have ""their"" version of the grilled cheese. i being the grilled cheese connoisseur, was not that impressed. it was served on a rosemary flat bread that also had a layer of bread between the cheeses. i could do with out that extra layer. maybe more cheese instead of the bread layer.  i will come back just to try another of their soups, have some wine and sit in the sun and yelp on my laptop. hopefully next time there will be more people around so i don't get that weird ghost town vibe.",1
"my favorite and only place i will go for hawaiian bbq out here. their teriyaki chicken is really good. the sauce is sweet and tasty. i also like their katsu. nice, crispy and crunchy. portions are big. i'm usually satisfied with a mini plate, which comes with: a meat of your choice, one scoop of rice and a salad (tossed green salad or potato mac). their potato mac is really good. sprinkle some black pepper on it and you're golden. sometimes they have spam musubi at the counter. yum. and also, they have hawaiian soft drinks in the little fridge by the counter. my fav is the lilikoi (passionfruit) regular or iced tea. the ladies here are super friendly.",1
"as my first dinner in mesa - i looked to yelp and found my answer. with my usual enormous dinner appetite i decided that a well-regarded indian buffet was right up my alley.    i showed up around 7pm and was instantly seated at a dimly-lit, partitioned-off two-seater (note: good option for a date). it became immediately apparent how attentive the staff was when i was served a complimentary piece of sizzling chicken tandoori (placed on a bed of cabbage and sautéed peppers/onions), followed by some freshly made garlic naan as i sat down with my buffet starter plate of samosa, vege fritters, sweet cheese balls and some accompanying sweet/spicy sauces.    a little about the spread: they have a nice variety of savory chicken, lamb, goat and even egg dishes. a tasty chicken biryani, or an optional bismati rice right out of the steamer go great with any of the creamy masalas/currys. there are some vegetarian dishes as well, and they have bottomless mango lassi and creamy tea available to wash it all down.    i tried almost everything they offered and enjoyed it all - up to the point where i could barely manage to grunt when offered service by the ever-so-attentive waitstaff. but i had my mind fixated on one item i saw up there.. i had to go on..    i took a final, small plate and loaded up two scoops of their mango custard. woooww.. in my food-borne inebriation my eyelids sagged whenever this godlike concoction hit my tastebuds. insulting my already overstuffed stomach with a final, unneccessary swig of their delicious tea i was walking out with a large grin on my face - knowing that i have already found a keeper on my first night out :)",1
"salt river tubing runs its operation like a well-oiled machine, with frequent shuttles at the pick up points with drivers who know what they're doing and are happy to help you out.  srt works hard to keep the environmental impact of recreational tubing under control, running staff through the river regularly servicing srt-provided waste receptacles and equipping tubers with plastic bags designated for trash collection.  the availability of restroom facilities, even pit toilet park-standard facilities, regularly along the route does wonders for making this activity civilized.  fun and well worth the thirteen bucks for a day rental of tube and shuttle service.",1
"an update to this review.  after all this happened, the event organizers complained to the corporate office.  apparently, the follow up to this was that the manager who was leading the charge on doing this was fired.  good riddance.",0
the food here was a little pricey for the lack of flavor it had. the server screwed up and was supposed to remove the order that was messed up on my friends bill. the service was not up to par. i've had much better pizza elsewhere and won't be coming back here. there was a reason they weren't very busy on a friday night i'm sure.,0
"i'm giving up a gem here folks.  but i dig this place so much, i had to share.  if you're a fan of the ""dive bar"", you've found a great one!  located on the se corner of 16th street and bethany home in the old strip mall behind starbucks (that used to be el pollo asado, for you old timers), swizzle is a find!  after a few drinks, i bought a t-shirt from here that touts, ""swizzle inn...swagger out"".  gotta love it.  your standard dive bar with a pool table, darts and a pot luck on friday nights for happy hour.  the drinks are strong and cheap.  shannon's a great bar tender!    no food at the swizzle, but that's ok, they'll let you bring it in.  on a few occasions, we've had pizza delivered or brought in take out from other places.  ladies, you'll be impressed with the restroom.  it's clean and always has toilet paper, as well as a fully stocked vanity with mouthwash, hair spray, lotion, tampons, etc.  not what you expect in the typical dive.  the crowd is diverse from young professionals to bikers.  ""family"" friendly too.  everyone is welcome at the swizzle.  cheers!",1
"i've heard fantastic things about this place. that it is a cozy and the sandwiches and salads are perfect for a ""ladies lunching"" type of afternoon.   my girlfriend and i decided to give it a whirl today and i wish i could have my $23 back. yes, $23 for lunch which was 1 salad, 1 sandwich and 2 diet cokes. rip off.   we had the hob nob cob salad which was gross. it was seriously a salad you could make better at home - spring lettuce, a tiny sliver of avocado and some turkey meat and sprinkle of bacon drenched in ranch dressing. i really should have taken it back because the amount of dressing made it unedible. i could have rung-out my salad.  then, we split the vito sandwich (the italian one) - again... it was falling apart and the lid on the balsamic jar must have fallen off as they were putting the dressing on our sandwich because it was soggy and dripping. zero presentation.   the only good thing about this place is the ambience.",0
it was just ok. the service was great at least our waitress was. i feel this place has become to big for it's own good. i have eaten at mimi's in ca back in the late 80-'s early 90's and it was very good. i realize now it was purchased by bob evan's in 2004 and i can see now why the quality has gone downhill.  now it is just ok with greasy food.  i tend to only go for breakfast so i am not versed on lunch or dinner here.  breakfast is ok. nothing special but not terrible either.,0
"i personally will never eat there again.  the chips are actually amazing though, i would eat those a lot if it didnt require me stpping foot in the ultimate bro/slut restaurant.   the food is gross, the tortillas are ok, i like the decor actually, but the employees are slutty (and by slutty i saw skirts soo short if they picked something off the floor you for sure would see vagina)  apparently the uniform is jean skirts and heels.  this is the male glittery shirt wearing capitol of scottsdale. the food sucks, dont eat here!",0
"finally made my way to fattoush and i have to say ""mmm mmmm good!"" not since my old neighbor, a refugee from iraq, moved out have i had i experienced such robust flavors combined with healthy food. lord i miss that man!!!  so yeah there isn't much of an atmosphere, the pictures don't really fit in the molding that was hung to frame art, but does that effect the food? absolutely not! physically, not much has changed since this place was the green leaf cafe which was the predecessor to the persian garden. except that the food here is less on the fusion side of mediterranean flavors and more middle-eastern authentic iraqis with a little jordanian thrown in.  i love that you start out with the green lentil soup or salad with every meal. the name of the restaurant actually comes from said salad, which is a mix of romaine, tomatoes, cucumber, mint and toasted triangles of pita bread, covered with a tart balsamic vinegar dressing. but the soup is where it's at. it's unlike your average lentil soup - smooth and creamy, with bits of pasta. very mild. it's a nice homey touch which is really what this food is all about. and that homey touch comes naturally, as the two main staffers are brother and sister. their mom often helps out in the kitchen (and dad is busy cooking in scottsdale).  when we arrived there were just two tables with guests, so we had our pick of eating spots. and there were a steady stream of people coming in for take-out throughout our visit.   the menu is actually quite large considering their kitchen is about the size of my bathroom. on this visit, my sis and i decided to sample as much as we could to get a feel for the place. she was a little iffy as she had never had this kind of food, but once the dishes started rolling out, she quickly became a fan. we started with the fava beans, mixed with olive oil, garlic, and lemon. main courses consisted of the falafel plate which comes with warm pita, hummus, pickles, and tomatoes and chicken shwarmas which were spiced perfectly and had juicy - dare i say succulent chicken. we topped the meal off with some freshly made baklava and rolled our way out to the car for our trip home.  just after the soup course, a large ford taxi pulled up and out of it piled out 8 full grown (some more fully grown if you get my drift, than others) me men. it was sort of like the proverbial clown car... i mean seriously i didn't know you could get that many men in one car. they headed straight for the table next to us and then things really started to pick up. four of them ordered lamb kuzi and the rest all got something different. let me just say that my sister had to hold me down because their food all looked so good. their table was literally crammed full of dishes with smells so good that i swear my nose grew just trying to get a better whiff!  our meal came to $25  but in retrospect, we really didn't need all three dishes and could have easily gotten out of there for about $16. service was attentive, food was phenomenal (and healthy - how often do you find that?!!), and it's only .5 miles from my house. this is probably the best me food that i've had at a local restaurant and the place would definately warrant the coveted 5-stars on the food alone, but the afore mentioned atmosphere knocks it down one. it may have taken me years to get over to fattoush, but it won't be long before my next visit! that kuzi is calling me!!!",1
"well, i had high hopes for this place as this was my second visit and probably my last. friend and i shared a 3 meat combo. no distinctives between  the pork, chicken or beef brisket. i will say the service was great, and the sauces were very good, but i like a smoke ring....it's why i like bbq. coleslaw was 4 stars and the beans were interestingly good. $22.00 for lunch for two with water. sorry.....i've had better bbq.",0
"margaritas were tasty but a little light on the booze.  complementary chips and salsa were better than average.  even though we didn't get any food the waiter still brought us a white chocolate with pecan mini tamale for desert at no charge.  nice touch, just for that kind gesture i'll come back to eat.",1
"it isn't easy to find good sushi in phoenix. usually, even if you do find it, you have to subject yourself to annoying house beats and dress up like you're going clubbing afterwards to fit in.   which is why moto is such an aberration. it's sandwiched between a blockbuster and mcdonalds at 16th st. and glendale, so the cheezy factor can pretty much be immediately ruled out.   i remember this when it was still a shogun express, which i also enjoyed, but i must say, i like moto even more. they have some creative appetizers including the asian nachos, which are essentially nachos with sour cream and chicken and guacamole but instead of tortilla chips, they use fried wontons. genius, i tell you.   happy hour prices are more than fair and the caterpillar and spicy tuna rolls are some of the best i've found. try the all-you-can-eat deal on the weekends, too . . . hard to beat.",1
"ok...i am into dive bars.  this place is not a dive bar, it is just plain filth.  i never felt so disgusting in a drinking establishment in my life.   my drink was horrible and my partner in crime was getting hit on by some nasty guy with sores on his face.  people were playing beer pong on a ping pong table...which then made me feel like i was 16 years old.  i am actually embarassed for this place.",0
"i love coupons. apparently the server at cantina laredo doesn't. i presented mine (free guacamole!) and she looked horrified but returned a few minutes later with all the proper ingredients. it was fun to watch the guacamole mashed together right in front of our eyes. we dined with some out of town guests who found the guacamole presentation exciting ... i fear that until friday night they had never been introduced to it.   our out-of-towners are not familiar with the mexican food the way most phoenicians are and asked *lots* of questions that were met with nothing short of annoyance from our server. then my dad demanded the server re-explain an entree for my mother, who ""might"" want to order it (she didn't). yes, our table was probably a pretty annoying one to be stuck with, but that's part of being a server. suck it up. i'm sure you dealt with people far more awful than our group before.  our food arrived within a reasonable length of time. the server and her helper had a hard time figuring out whose food belonged to whom - fine at applebee's, but i expected that this place would match the entree to the diner with ease. the food, admittedly, looked great. i had the fiesta chicken salad, complete with not ripe avocado and delivered with the wrong dressing. i ate it anyway. chicken was way too salty. hub had the carne asada steak. it was served charred but tasty, and portion was really small. we just didn't understand how that cheap cut of meat could fetch $18.99. i can't speak to what the other 5 in our group had; i was focused on choking down my salty chicken.   after our food was delivered, our server failed to appear again until she asked if we would like dessert. i could have used another vodka tonic 20 minutes earlier and a water refill. dessert, a chocolate nut brownie thing with ice cream, was created table side and everyone agreed it was the best part of the meal. my bottom line: the food we ate was overpriced. our food was just ok. service sucked. there's no reason to go back.",0
"good sandwiches... i'm a fan of the midwest best and the white widow. been going here for a long time and anyone looking at reviews trying to decide... just go and give it a shot man! it's a fun experience and the food is good, everyone is going there... no peer pressure!!! :)  they should have one of these in every campus town!",1
this was was my first time here. i was really excited to try this place out i have heard so many good things about it. parking sucks... drove in circles then found a spot. the building itself lookes like it was closed but it was just the shades that made the windows look blackened.  i was seated immediately. the waitress was not much help when i asked a couple questions. so i just went and ordered what i was familiar with a gyro and side greek salad. i did order the cilantro hummus now that was very good. tasty perfectly creamy and well seasoned. glad that came out because i was starving. and it took forever to get my lunch. i kinda almost wanted to pay for my hummus and leave.  i couldn't though because as everyone else was getting served my taste buds and stomach told me not to. i kept seeing plate  after plate brought out to my neighbors. i wish my server offered me some of the other things that i was seeing. but oh well. when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there. it was actually good. now i have had gyros at a few places and i just kept thinking is this pita from frozen?  i have seen pita bread that has been frozen and thawed before and it looked exactly like this.  when i have had pita at other places it looks like the greek dude in the back hand made that sucker. just wondering.  oh and another thing is if you are serving hummus please provide enough thawed out pita. i do have to admit the hummus was delicious. my gyro was huge and filling and the price was not bad for it. but this is just another joint for people to say omg hey lets hang at the pita jungle and be cool. i think its a nice place to come for a business meeting or meeting of something. and lighting does suck in there.,0
"woooooooowwwwww!!!   i feel like i'm taking crazy pills!!!   what are all of these people doing giving such high reviews???   once a month, i meet up with my ladies. but after one of our foursome flaked, it was me and another femme with our name on the list for 3.  (we were waiting for drunky who probably slept in).  we went to the brand-spankin' new location which is apparently huge with a whopping 9 whole tables!!! (it could be more, but i am not exaggerating, i can only remember 9) we waited for 20 minutes in the waiting area, and our friend was still not there (suspected hangover) but they called our names and we were seated.  our lovely young male waiter came along and we ordered drinks and told him our friend would be along at any minute.  he said no worries and would be back with our beverages.    let me start off by saying i never go to breakfast joints because i do not eat eggs.  no i'm not a vegetarian or vegan, i just hate the idea of eating a fetus.  that's all.  unfortunately that left me with one or two options with the very egg heavy menu... a waffle meal, a side order of sausage or juice.  bring on the waffles!!!! we wait, and wait, and wait for our slacker friend for ten minutes. during the ten minutes waiting for our friend, it began to get packed at the front door with foodies glaring at our horrible twosome, for taking a four-top. how dare we!!!!! don't blame us for where the hostess seated us?  after 10 minutes, the hostess walks over and asks us what the hold up is.   ?????   i'm sorry are we not shoveling down your ""big breakfast's"" fast enough for you?!  we politely stated, that our friend was going to be there any minute (she was, she was texting us that she was down the street).   then the hostess says (verbatim): ""i'm sorry we're not supposed to seat parties until everyone is here. you're going to have to order right now.""  ???  appalled, and not willing to fight, i say: ""okay, well i guess we were both getting the waffles and britney will order when she gets here"".   the hostes replies: ""unfortunately i'm going to have to ask you to order for her, or we wont be able to accommodate an order for your friend.""  i giggled thinking she was joking.  she stared blankly at me...  what??????????????  so you're telling me, that we gave you our name and our party number, 3.  you saw two of us even though your little notebook clearly said 3.  you sat us at a large table leaving the masticating buzzard hoard to wish us dead. we've been here for ten minutes when most brunch places expect you to wait at least 10 minutes before ordering.  we cannot enjoy our drinks or reading the menu without feeling harassed. we have to order before our friend or else. then you tell me, that you will not serve a paying customer because she will order 5 minutes after us???? that's a joke right???   no joke.    (i smiled while all of this was being screamed at the hostess from my angry brain)  i tried to text brit, but as she was parking she didn't get back to me quickly enough so we decided to order 3 waffle breakfasts and hope brit wasn't allergic to anything in the meal???  luckily the second the food came out she was there and she enjoyed her waffles.  i with a bad taste in my mouth from that did not enjoy anything after that experience.  separate and apart from the hostess being a b, the waffles were decent, but not 4.5 stars decent. i would give a solid 3 for those.  our waiter was clearly embarrassed that we were being blamed for the hostess's mistake and told us that we should take our time and enjoy our breakfast. i wish i had gotten his name because he was the only redeeming factor for this place and why it is getting 2 stars instead of one.  he is white, skinny, 20-something and really chill and relaxed. nice guy.    i will not be returning and will find another breakfast place just as good in phoenix, like i have all over the valley.  plus, with more egg-less options as well!  this place has pizzeria bianco syndrome where they think their food is heaven sent and give you garbage service because you should be thankful they even gave you the right to eat there.  no thank you.  the bill was appropriate, not exorbitant.  but if i want to be harassed while i eat my breakfast i'll eat with my parents.   thanks but no thanks matt, i wish ye well. but perhaps with a better hostess.",0
"the location of this place, city north, has been struggling a bit over the years with restaurants that can keep their doors open. it's a fun location; several restaurants and stores all within walking distance to each other.  i liked this restaurant a lot. the patio is quite large and bar access; it's sort of a sunken/basement like patio that is completely covered so it should stay relatively cool during the summer months.  the menu is classic to a pizza type restaurant... pizza, meatballs, salads. etc. but it offers more as you can see when you visit. went here on a monday night as a very large group and the staff did pretty well... my food order didn't get placed so that was a negative to them but i did understand with the large group we had. i did eventually get my meal, albeit, 45 mins. later, but she comp'd part of the bill to say ""sorry"" that i appreciated. i was impressed with the selection of beers on tap as well. happy hour specials on drinks was good, 1/2 off i think, and they have a reverse happy hour late night too. i will check this place out again for a regular date night with the hubby and then perhaps we can work off the meal with a stroll down the street and some window shopping.",1
"this is the place to be if you want to catch the ethel merman of piano players.  nicole pesce pounds out those keys for the benefit of the back row, baby!  whenever nicole's there (most weekend nights) the bf and i try to sit as far away from her as possible and i always tell the person seating us, but it doesn't seem to matter.  apparently the show must go on.    nicole plays well, but she doesn't need to bang away at the keys of her concert grand.  the dining room is fairly small and made up of hard surfaces, so the acoustics are good enough for softer piano playing.  i was once subjected to sitting next to the piano when i was there with a group and there was no other seating option.  this was in the old days when it would take an hour and a half or longer for a salad.  it was like being banished to a really, really loud dining/show tune purgatory.  in fairness, i have also heard nicole play at the brunch at the ritz-carlton and there she tones down the volume and you can really appreciate her significant talents.  at my florist, be sure to watch her bounce her head along to the beat as she looks around the room; it's like getting a show along with your mediocre dinner.  a number of reviewers wonder why my florist survives when the food and service are okay at best.  sure the bread is as hard as a rock because it doesn't contain any preservatives and you can only get a sandwich or a salad, but my florist is one of the few restaurants in the immediate area that serves dinner late.  on the flip side, you'll be paying too much and the service will range from spotty to surly.  i think many of the male servers and bar tenders are hired more for their looks than their restaurant experience.  this ups the gay vibe, which is nice, but it doesn't help the place run smoothly.  if there were more late night dining options in the area, i don't think my florist would enjoy the business that it has.  as an aside, if you're wondering why the menu is limited to sandwiches and salads, it's because the kitchen is set up as a bakery.  they've got an oven, but they don't have a stove.  i skip breakfast here because they're prepping your eggs in a microwave.  the decor is modern and spare; like az-88 and postino had a love child.  one of my most memorable dining experiences was one afternoon when i was having lunch at my florist and the sun was shining on the south side of the restaurant and it was pouring rain on the north side of the restaurant.  that's a good analogy for my florist cafe.  it's got style, but the food and service are okay at best.  if az-88 ran without a stove, the food would be similar to what you get at my florist.      my florist if fine so long as you go there with very limited expectations and a small appetite.  it's a gussied up sandwich and salad place that makes it due to a lack of competition.    bang on, nicole, bang on!",0
"i posted a quick tip while i was there today but for some reason that doesn't show up on the yelp website. wtf? any how.. i kindly asked the bartender if she could put the golf on the tv today.. seeing as how we were the only people at the bar i figured this would not be an issue. it turns out all tv's in the entire restaurant are controlled by 1 directtv box and it was ""first come first served"" when it came to the channel that was on. she asked her fellow employees if anyone was watching the basketball game and 3 waiters responded ""yes"". it turns out it was the wait staff that was watching the game rather than catering to their customers and she said she couldn't change it. this is not the first time i have had horrible customer service at this place. it's a shame too because i like their crappy mexican food and home brewed beer but with attitudes like that it's no wonder they have only 2 1/2 stars. how do you turn away customers and money just because the lazy ass wait staff wants to watch basketball? never ever will go there again. p.s. why does the logo show a chili that's farting? might want to hire a real graphic designer like myself next time.",0
"tried to avoid chains last year but people invite us to them , and, well we can't be dicks all the time. the last experience i had at a carrabba's in scottsdale was pretty good so  let's try the one in glendale,  quickly seated,  drinks, and appetizer  were great. the soup, spicy sausage and lentil  was so good i looked up a copycat recipe for it . the goat cheese and pomodoro sauce brushcetta  had us feeling all happy and relaxed.   then   main meal arrived. wife's meat was not medium, not even close you could get red out of it.   neither myself of the kid had cutlery so  it took a while to get a waiter to stop to remedy this. this interval turned my veal marsala into a gelatinous mess  when cold. it tasted of flour and barely of marsala which i can make about 23 times better at home.   wife's dish was re heated it  well done with black hightlights .not a new meal. now it's heavy on the grill flavor.   spoke to manager heather , she came to us, but i can't ask for more ( actually i told them to leave it on the check )  than they drop it.   the kids meal  was great!  but they ruined the evening , seriously a dessert ain't going to count two messed up entrees    2.5 rounded down.",0
"w00t! a coffee spot that carries almond milk! now i know what you must be thinking... ""big deal, almond milk?"" ... but yes, it is a big deal, a very big deal.   you see, 99% of coffee shops choose to solely carry soy milk alone as their non-dairy creamer alternative. unfortunately, you are currently reading the writings of a vegan who is allergic to soy milk, makes my throat all itchy and sore feeling, but i digress...   royal made me happy by offering almond milk and i happily slurped down my iced vanilla almond milk latte while traversing the many wonders of the phoenix open air public market on saturday morning.  -1 star since i had to mix up my drink myself.  take note other coffee shops: please carry another non-dairy creamer besides soy milk.",1
before a suns game.. we decide to head to turf for a bit of pregame fatty grub and cider.. hit the spot.. do i love love this place.. umm no.. but my mark does.. & it was one of our first dates.. so ill have to always rate it high for sealing the deal:-),1
"phoenix, we need to seriously recognize that we have a great thing going here and exploit it.  we're humbly cool, our best restaurant is a pizza place, we're a tough crowd who has a artistic bent, we need to celebrate that.  sucker punch sally's does.  so does the roosevelt, four peaks, fez, stinkweeds, hoodlums, cowtown, sunset clothing, frances, honey bears, queen's pizza, lux, pita jungle...  if you haven't gleaned, i love this place.  i don't know the owners, they might not like me, as i'm a bit square, but i'm so happy they are taking this risk.  the use the rockabilly motif and rock it out in spades.  menu is standard diner fare, but with a twist.  they aren't running their full menu yet, smart move for a business getting on its feet in this economy, but what they are offering is good dinner food.  the three of us had a great time there.  $3 16oz pabst, great loose meet sandwich and the homemade bbq chips that came with it.  had a bite of the navajo taco and the pork tenderloin sandwich, both very good and huge portions.  the rest of the menu is great too, chilli fries, wings (try the sally's sauce), milkshakes and (thank the lord) affordable breakfast served all day.  they also have a full bar and soda fountain.  and they have a stage for live music.  and they are open 24 hours.  you know what else is open 24 hours in phoenix?  f'ing mcdisgustings and a bunch of crap mex places.    love phoenix or leave phoenix (or make it somewhere you can love)",1
"sun asia is not a 5-star restaurant, but for what it is, i give it 5 stars.   they have probably the best happy hour i have ever seen that lasts from 3pm-7pm then 9pm-close, and is seven days a week. the hh menu includes single pieces of sushi for $0.99, rolls for $3, and a variety of other fried appetizers for a few bucks (including fried tofu and vegetable dumplings that are vegan friendly) in addition to a ton of cheap ass booze. you can get a sake bomber with kirin/kirin light for $3.85. beers (domestic and import) are under $2, cocktails are $5, and they even have scorpion bowls!  the staff has been very friendly and quick to answer questions, and the service is always quick.   the decor is totally funky inside, which i personally like. it has a lot of character. they also have a really nice patio that is great for beautiful days and day drinking!  their regular menu is really expansive and i've only had the kung pao tofu, but it was really good.   they have free delivery with a $25 minimum, but only specific hours. m-f 11a-3p/5p-8p and sat/sun 12-8p. you can fax or email your order in too, which i think is pretty cool. delivery is from 16th ave - 48th street, broadway to dobbins.   thank god we have sun asia because there is practically nothing else in south phoenix. definitely hit this place up if you are in the area!!!",1
"this is my new favorite hangout. the beer is great. the food quality was excellent. i had the shrimp satay and the shrimp were quality, the dish was amazing, even the veggies tasted good and were part of the dish,... not sure an after thought. my wife got the black bean burger and it was tasty. we also ordered the beer cheese soup. it was pretty good. i rated this five stars because the place is going to be amazing once they get their ""newness kinks"" worked out..  pros- love the look and feel food was kick-ass! very tasty and fresh! fantastic beer - had the leg humper you could tell all the staff was friendly the management was good to us, stopped by and talked with us about the wait, etc.  a couple small suggestions for the management - note these ""complaints"" come from a good place, we really love you guys and want you to be the best you can be.  -when we first came in the hostess station was abandoned. we waited a few minutes and a girl walked slowly over, offered to seat us then was overall just slow...make sure she knows to be quick when seating, ask how many are in the party and inside/outside. she was very sweet, she just needs to execute a little faster. -you were out of high chairs for our 2 year old (i saw one or two in use already)..buy a couple more, you are in gilbert which is family crazy...you will need more.  -i saw a server drinking beer, then running out to help a table -i got my beer right away but my wife's ice tea was forgotten. our server was not back to remind her and it took about 15 minutes to get her drink. our server noted she was new and apologized. she was awesome, we really liked her, she just needs a little more training. she was also slow to check on us, bring our check, etc. the place is not huge, servers need to be on top of it. watch for empty drinks, clear plates quickly, etc. keep this server 100% she is great, just more training and urgency! tell her to pretend she is a member of each table in her mind and to look out for her friends, do they need something, are they done?  -when our beer cheese soup came out it came without spoons. it took us 5 mins or so to get somebody's attention to get spoons. also, the crouton was funky, swap it for a regular purchased crouton or make sure yours is crunchy, it was crunchy on the outside but kinda stale and chewy on the inside. the soup itself was super good! -food took a long time, you mentioned you were short a cook and i totally get it - the food was absolutely worth the wait.    i feel kind of guilty posting this, i love the place so much...i have no doubt you guys will be 110% soon.",1
"this place is very strange.  the atmosphere is more like a foreign grocery store than a restaurant, but the food is really good.  ok, i have only ever tried one dish but the other food looks really good too!  they have a large selection of unusual salads and the desserts are always really tempting.  they also have sandwiches and pasta.  i keep meaning to go back here, but it is a little out of my way in general.",1
"the idea of a bar with a pool is a great idea. however spanish fly could do better.  i've been to this location twice, during the day and a night visit.  i was not impressed.  at night no one is allowed in the pool so everyone is cramped around the deck.  this makes it very tricky walking around the pool.  during the day its a whole other story.  i am impressed with the giant menu and so many food options available.  the drink menu was a great selection too!  i am happy that they did keep the ginormous drinks that drift use to carry. my first impression of spanish fly is that you need a tattoo to get through the door and not just any ordinary tattoo.  you need a giant tribal tattoo or a full sleeve!  this place does get packed.  if you don't have a day bed or cabana, i recommend you get there early to claim a spot.    ok food and drinks but a little over priced.  the service was ok.  its a great place for people watching.",0
"word to the wise: do not plan on eating here during a lunch rush during your hour lunch. you will not be able to eat your food. these restaurants are always very crowded with limited space. it's a fun place to eat though if you pick the right time. they have some good lunch specials and i enjoy their sandwiches (get them on focaccia!) and pastas. they have slices for lunch which are a great deal, very cheap and you won't have to wait an hour to eat pizza. for some reason i really like their side salad...it's definitely got more oomph than a normal side salad. items i enjoy: *guaca tony: this is a great but filling appetizer, a huge bowl of guacamole with a giant large size pizza crust, yum!* italian fried potatoes, aka potato wedges: really yummy seasoned goodness, served with their sandwiches unless you upgrade to their sweet potato fries which pack quite the punch, sweet and very spicy* mrs. gibbilini's spinach salad: spinach, candied pecans, gorgonzola cheese, red peppers, bacon, mandarin oranges, and a unique asian dressing...very different flavor but i got hooked* dinner salad/side salad: spring mix, tomatoes, red onions, gorgonzola cheese, and the dressing of your choice...a light yummy salad to pair with your italiano* sandwiches i enjoy are the turkey stuffed, veggie wedgie, and the meatball sandwich...again, you should really try these on their focaccia*the pesto penne bake: bread bowl with pasta in it! yummy!*alfredo the dark: a spicy creamy alfredo type of pasta*the pizza cookie:  1/2 pound cookie fresh baked covered in ice cream! bring room for this baby!",1
"i've had margaritas at hundreds of restaurants, and the house margarita at garcia's was by far the worst one i've ever had.  so bad, in fact, that i didn't even finish it.....and that's never happened before.  it tasted more like a lime popsicle....that supposedly had tequila in it.  the spinach queso was good, as well as the chips.  salsa was mild.....bland.  it took our waiter well over 5 minutes to take our drink order, but service improved after that.  all in all, probably won't be going back.",0
"cowboys and gangsters and mechanical bull riding and cheap booze and wet  shirt contests and random concerts and beer tub girls in ass-less chaps. how can you fuck this up? graham central station is so ridiculous that it should be awesome.  but it isn't. somehow. how?  this place is a huge mess. every person in here frightens me.   i guess  you could get totally hammered and try to ignore the scariness and really party here. but i can't do it.  but i dare you to do it. if you do go here, please tell us alllllllll about it.",0
"it is the best burger in phoenix.  but the drunk idiots at the end of the bar ruin the ambience for me.  two occasions and both times, d.i.s standing, yelling and partying right by the front door.  not my thing.  but that sweet / spicy burger is insane.  don't take it from me.  i still remember a prominent local restraunteur who also happens to have one of the top 3 burgers in cenpho said:  ""i dream about it at night"".",1
"oregano's... my love affair with oregano's is long. it started in flagstaff (still my favorite location) and continues today.  this location  lacks a little of the joi de vivre of the flag or south scottsdale locations. however, the caliber of food is consistently high and makes up for whatever i imaginen i'm missing... there is a large patio, surrounded by (woefully inadequate amounts of) parking.  you can almost always expect a touch of waiting.   however, whether you order the savory thin crust pizza, the warm and creamy boom dip, a deep dish with goat cheese, herbs, onion and extra sauce, or just have dessert for dinner with an ooey gooey pizzookie, you can't go wrong!",1
"guess i'm the odd woman out in this string of reviews! my husband and i stayed here on memorial day evening to get away for our anniversary, and we both detested almost every aspect of our experience. thanks a lot, priceline! we had bid $75 for a ""resort"" in the phoenix area, and at that bid, we probably deserved what we got, but we're still a little bitter :). when we pulled up the driveway to check in, it seemed promising. there were lots of trees and flowers, and everything looked really clean.   the bad part started when we went in to check in. the clerk informed us that they were only ""40% full"" and therefore had our pick of room locations - any floor, any view, etc. we told him we wanted a first-floor pool view. easy enough. then he asked if we ""preferred"" two queens or a king. well, since we weren't planning on having any additional overnight guests, we let him know we preferred a king. well, despite the 40% occupation rate that he had advertised just seconds earlier, he told us that this ""upgrade"" would carry a $20 fee. we declined and were really annoyed - rather than make a hospitable gesture and offer us a king, which clearly wasn't in high demand - they insisted on charging us. just a lost opportunity to please the customer! as someone else already mentioned, the resort fee of $16 also seemed useless - it included overnight parking (on a roof-top, unshaded lot), free internet (if you happened to bring our laptop, which most pleasure travelers wouldn't), 2 bike rentals (we just wanted to go to the pool!), and a ""coffee bar"" (some carafes of coffee on a table in a dark corridor). blech.   we went to our room, at least hoping it would be nice. well, it wasn't. to start with, it was incredible dark, but rather than offering curtains, the first-floor room had dark wood plantation shutters - opening them barely let any light in. one of the floor lamps was also broken. the dark wood trim, accessories, and enormous amoire gave off more of a spanish monastery vibe than a posh scottsdale resort. the bathroom was also nothing to write home about - the shower was really small and the curtain looked dingy. to top it all off, we turned on the tv and every channel had a fuzzy picture.   so, you ask, were there any positives? ok, ok, sitting out by the pool was great (although i attribute that more to the gorgeous phoenix weather) than the pool (the surface was peeling in a bunch of places, and the walls around the pool were literally covered in moss, which looked to be due to neglect and not a stylistic choice) but the $3.50 well margaritas we had at the pool bar (happy hour 3:30-6:30) were surprisingly good, as were the crab taquitos we ordered as a snack. if you love outdated and overgrown, you'll love this resort. otherwise, avoid it.",0
"the first time i heard about mfc was when i was invited into a book club by a bunch of women at my new job about a year and a half ago. that about sums it up - women love this place, and go there to drink wine and be silly and talk about books from oprah's book club.  i get it - there's a pianist, and fresh cut flowers and ""florist"" and ""café"" are right in the name. it's got ""silly wine women"" painted all over it. when my friend picked this spot as the place for our regular hh get-together for some late 20's 9-5ers it made sense. i went to the web site to check on pricing. i was annoyed to see salads for $15, sandwiches for not much less. no happy hour specials? now i'm downright pissed. then i went to check out some reviews and was surprised that so many yelpers had given it poor reviews for service and food quality. how do they justify the prices? and what's this about _microwaving_ the food?!  but, my friend had been looking forward to trying mfc, so i zipped my lip and showed up. i like the space - the long, floor-to-ceiling storefront style windows let light stream in and the décor is simple and airy. i was the first to arrive and told the host who was at the front (i guessed a manager as he had an air of importance and hurriedness about him and wore a different colored shirt than the rest of the staff) there would be five of us. his response: ""ooooooooooo-kaaaay."" nice attitude. then, ""do you not have a reservation?"" um, for five people at 5 o'clock? no, of course not. it was not busy at all, but he made a big show of wandering around the restaurant, finger to mouth and looking perplexed about my request.  finally i offered to sit at the bar until the rest arrived and continued to go ""wtf?"" when discovering there wasn't a glass under $12 or a bottle under $50. again, how is this justified?  when two other girls arrived about 10 min later, i flagged him down and said ""we're ready for a table,"" and he again seemed noticeably annoyed (so much so that the other girls commented on it). i had envisioned mfc was hh hot spot, especially on a friday, and kept waiting for it to fill up, but it never did and i still don't understand the issue.  ok- one good, important point to note, our actual server was awesome. she was friendly, helpful and attentive. gave informed suggestions/opinions when asked, etc. then i found out that bottles were half off: ok, that's a little better. (then one of the girls mentioned that bottles are half off all day, every day... then why not put that price on the menu? to uphold some image of pretention? i don't get it and i'm back to annoyed).  we got the willow bread basket to share. the herbed butter overpowered the taste of the fresh breads and i had maybe half a piece (i'm a bread addict and surprised i didn't devour all of it - just wasn't that good. the best one was the cranberry). i ordered the ""nachos"" app for $8 and it was ok (one-inch bread slices smothered in jalapeño-cheese with avocado and salsa on the side). one girl got a wrap and loved it. another got lobster bisque and said it was just ok. after everyone was done and had formed their own opinions on their meals, i shared my findings on no stove/microwave situation. they were all pretty shocked, especially in light of the prices.  i was disappointed that the live music i had heard so much about didn't start up until 7, right when we were getting ready to leave. i really don't think any of us had an experience that would draw us back.  (sorry this is so long. i try to edit myself, i really do)",0
"not too bad. it's a upscale sports bar.  food is pretty good and they always have wine/drink specials.  usually not many people in there.  i need to put this in rotation more often, maybe a lunch or pregame stop before going out one night.",1
"this is honestly one of the worst hotels i've ever stayed in -- worse than that ant-infested holiday inn in wyoming. worse, even, than the dirtiest youth hostel i visited in mexico. why? because it's overpriced and disgustingly pretentious. the worst part about this joint was the lobby, which reminds me of what might happen if  salvador dali met christina aguilera in 'moulin rouge.' and then they had a love child.   i get the idea of a hip boutique hotel. but this is just some crappy 1960s motel that they painted black and white and furnished with shitty ikea-esque furniture. really.  it reminded me of  some ""design on a dime"" example on hgtv. ""for just $40 and a bit of black paint, we transformed this aging motel into a hip destination!!!"" except that they didn't. the rooms are tiny, the bed was horribly uncomfortable and even the bathroom was...well...odd. they didn't even have a coffee maker! and the huge flat screen tv was too big for the room, so we couldn't even watch it properly.  i'm also convinced the front desk worker was faking some vague european accent, too, but i can't prove it.",0
yesss. i am truly blessed to live across the street from the pita jungle. this is one of the few places in scottsdale with a good selection of non-meats. i'm fairly sure they've imported the attractive hipster waitstaff from tempe as they look adorably out of place in this neighborhood. my favorite dish is the one thousand beans hot pita and i do believe it has nearly one thousand beans! for about $8 it feeds me for three meals.,1
"yes the decor is good, yes the inventory is gigantic, but there is nothing like poor service to turn me off to a place. we came in and asked if they had any 2004 brunellos. we were directed to the ""italy"" section then left on our own. luckily we could find the brunellos easily enough, but there was no one to offer suggestions such as ""this one is a great value"" or ""this one is fabulous and well worth the $5.00 more than the other..."" etc.   well ok, that wasn't what we'd hoped for but, we we still ok. next we were looking for a bottle of justin justification (a cab franc blend), plus we wanted to find a cab franc we hadn't tried yet. we had to wander around to find another person to help us. i asked for the justin, and the guy was bewildered. i explained it was a cab franc blend and he took me over to the cab sauv section. when i questioned this, he told me they have the cab francs with the cab sauvs. this seemed weird, so i started looking on the other side of the isle in other reds (or some generic section name like that) and bingo, found the justin, and a bunch of other cab francs. i was about to ask which he recommends when he blurted out ""well, i have to get back to my section"" and took off in what was almost a panic, leaving me to fend for myself. i was clearly about to ask a question - the words were starting to come out of my mouth... was he really that afraid of being away from ""his section""? was he afraid of not being able to answer my question? i was stunned. i still am.   so by that time i was irritated, and with over $100 of wine in the cart was thinking maybe they ought to recognize i could be a good customer....so i decide to give up and head for the cashier. at checkout we realized we forgot one of the gazillion coupons they mail out and exclaimed ""dang, we forgot our coupon"". we did not expect any response, it was just an exclamation. considering how prolific those coupons are, it would have been nice if the cashier said ""oh, i have one here you can use!"" but not doing would also be perfectly fine. instead we get a stream of complaints from the cashier about how he hates coupons because customers never read them and always want a discount for something that does not match the coupon, yadda yadda yadda. hm.... complaining about customers to other customers... is that wise? no. we are sticking to ajs where knowledgeable cellar masters can direct to good stuff, regardless of the price range.",0
"i really adore this place.  the staff is knowledgable and friendly even to wine novices like me.  the prices are good and there are always bottles chilled and ready to purchase and consume.  if you feel like eating, there are plates of cheese and hummus or light salads and sandwiches.  great places for a relaxing glass of wine with friends, but it can get busy and there aren't all that many tables.",1
"i don't get it. why is this place so great? it must be because it's one of the only theaters showing non-mainstream films.  i *love* seeing  non-mainstream film and there's a theater in santa cruz, ca and another in sfo that make sense for this....these ca  theaters have more than six rows in each theater, the demographics do not remind me of cruise ships, and the vibe is less pretentious.  i don't like tiny tiny theaters that smell and cost a lot of money. i won't go back here. the theaters are so small that it's almost like watching tv in your own living room. i won't go back to this place.",0
"let me preface my review by stating a few facts.  #1 my boyfriend and his family are chinese, and they were dining with me.  #2 the aforementioned chinese people in my party ordered everything for us in the spirit of authentic chinese cuisine.  #3 i put on a happy face and ate as much rice as i could to fill up.  :)  i like to start any decent meal with a good hand-washing, especially when eating with my chinese in-laws when they're in town from china.  i went into the bathroom at diamond's, and i almost hurled.  i am a mortician and around putrid smells every day of my life, so for the smell of a bathroom to turn my stomach is reeeally saying something.  i felt obligated to stay and eat.  i left the bathroom and used antibacterial hand sanitizer instead.  :(  so the food began to appear.  we ordered a big pot of oolong tea to accompany our meal.  we were warned that it, along with the glasses of water on our table, was tap water.  the steamed white rice was fine and dandy, and i ate most of it.  we got dungeness crab, served chopped up but still in the shell and smothered in a brown gravy sauce that was none-too-tasty and killed the delicious crab taste.  we also had lobster that was similarly served chopped into pieced and smothered in sauce, with the meat still inside.  this method of serving made it difficult to handle the food without getting your hands dirty, including serving it to yourself from the lazy susan.  we also had cod with all the bones in it and the eyeballs still in its head, completely intact.  i did not even taste it, as i've had some bad experiences with fish bones.  the rest of the table ate the whole thing, including the fish brain and eyeballs and cheeks.  *shudder*  just a matter of personal preference, but i can't do that.    all in all, i would never go back.  ever.  and i'd advise anyone with a weak stomach or a strong sense of smell to avoid this place at all costs.  again, this is simply my preference and opinion.  but i like to taste my food, not just the seasoned gravy thrown onto it.  and the smell... oh good heavens!  check please!",0
"i don't see the need to ever go to this place unless you are flying in or out of the deer valley airport and you just got off the longest flight in the history of flights and there was no food on board.  the buffet is just kinda gross.  they advertise a fish fry on wednesdays and fridays, but i don't see how they feel confident standing by their advertised fish fry.  it's just kinda gross.  the fried cod was too breaded and the fish didn't seem fresh or prepared right.  the lasagna was good, but not worth revisiting this place for.  i also sampled the shrimp cocktail (which was ok, but may have given me the shits), fried shrimp (bleh), fried chicken (ok), their soups (weren't very good), chocolate cake (crappy and stale tasting), rice pudding (barely ok),  and the table bread was fresh and nice (so stock up on that shit).  oh, and not a fan of their salad bar either really.  sorry deer valley airport restaurant (although really i think you should be apologizing to me), but i'll never be coming back.",0
"idiot boxes work here. i hate the customer service and dbag's that claim to be runners here. i can only say i get good deals on shoes but rather support a local joint. seriously this place is for people who don't run. they sell them shoes and inserts and they never come back. or come back with knee and joint problems due to improper shoes with way too much cushion. the customer service just sucks a ball. i hate how they greet you  and how they ring that stupid bell when someone joins the vip.  i am like fuck off!! you've seen me here before douche!! lame!!!!!! no thanks. wont be back. i took advantage of the shoe discount but i can buy on-line or local. fuck going in. oh and also folks, give me a break. your going to take advice from a hourly employee about what shoe is right for you due to a fancy treadmill with a camera? please. those guys don't know anymore about stride, foot strike and so on than the bum passed out at the bus stop! this place is a joke and makes it's money selling insoles and shoes to uninformed consumers. stay away! really!!",0
"i should have known that an italian restaurant with a french name would be bad news.  its just the start of the identity crisis going on.....  i don't really get what they're trying to do here.  are they aiming to be an upscale restaurant?  because the servers in t-shirts and the stripper poles placed throughout the dining room don't really lend themselves to that.  (and yes, i said stripper poles..... metal poles placed in between two leather arm chairs....)  the menu suggests they are trying to go in the direction of casual upscale but the quality of food and service doesn't support that.    i asked our server for a suggestion for a light, dry, non mineral-y white wine.  i got a very oakey, buttery, heavy white.  totally what i asked for, thanks.  overall the wine list was unimpressive, however, i did like the fact that you can order a quartino.  i was underwhelmed by the service; our server would disappear for long stretches of time and served me the salad my friend ordered in addition to serving the wrong beers to the wrong people. he also seemed to be lacking knowledge on the food that we ordered, telling my husband that the soup had pancetta flavor, when it actually had pancetta in it.  other members of my party had their flatware replaced after using their knife for bread and butter while i did not.  it was spotty service all around.    the quality of the food did not make up for the poor service.  two people in our party ordered the scallops, a bostonian and a new orleanian who are used to great scallops.  we both agreed they were pretty awful - very much overcooked; very chewy.  scallops should not be chewy, you should not have to work at eating them, they should just melt in your mouth.  not to mention one of the scallops was a bit sandy and obviously had not been properly cleaned.  i know, i know, stupid me, i shouldn't order seafood in the desert.  especially after eating amazing seafood for a week in ny.  the glace that they were served in had an extremely strong black licorice flavor.  i am not a fan of black licorice, in fact i know nobody that is.  the vegetables that accompanied the scallops were limp.  the aforementioned soup that my husband ordered did not have quite the right consistency due to the presence of the extremely hard pancetta which detracted from the texture of the beans.  his salad was ok; it did come with huge flakes of toasted garlic which fooled him as he thought they were almond flakes.    when asked if we would like dessert one my friends threw down an emphatic ""no, just the check!"" because the whole experience was just sub par and no dessert nor digestif could possibly save it.  just as a side note....i know that i'm a short girl but i hate it when i go to restaurants and sit on benches and my feet don't touch the ground.  it makes me feel stupid.    the food, the service, the atmosphere....whatever it is that they are aiming for just isn't working.",0
"this is another one of my absolute favorites in az. i've heard some folks pan on other boards but i just flat out don't get it. for people visiting az, this is a must go imo. my relatives visiting from australia requested it as their last meal on their way out of town.  first of all, i'm not a big green chili fan. second of all, rito's green chile burro is one of my top 3 bites in all of az.  tortillas are amazing (homemade), beans are amazing (i guess i'm still a big fan of lard). unbelievably, beans seem to get even better when you microwave them from the fridge the next day too.  i love the character of the place. it's run by a mother, her daughters & some other relatives. they do what they do & are who they are & don't really care beyond that. i've heard it compared to the soup nazi from the seinfeld episode. my first visit, i did get that vibe but the ladies have been super sweet many, many times. it is a bit tough to find, they have short hours, they only take cash and as the sign says, do not approach the window on your cell phone.    i think at present they quit making tacos because they were too much work & the mom has had some health issues. so basically you get what you get. i say get the green chile burro.  so they are who they are & do what they do, take it or leave it. i love it.  as far as the shop, it's basically just a barred window counter you order from, you pick up your food & go outside & eat on picnic-like tables.   they are open only m-f from 9 - 5ish. close even a bit earlier on fridays i think.   they're on 14th street just south of roosevelt right across from the school. you'll just see a screen door & that's it. if it's around lunch time, you'll probably see a line as well.  i think the short hours & no evenings, no weekends even add to the obsession for me. scarcity makes it even more desired.  right now, i cannot believe how much i'm craving this food.  btw, the warning about scalding food & soupy burrito are right on. ended up with a bunch of scalding green chili in my lap my first visit.",1
"i've passed this place for years and years and always appreciated the old-school appearance--similar to all of those chinese places i grew up with. the other day we finally got around to trying it.  i was not expecting genuine chinese food, on the contrary, i was expecting old-school, chinese-american stuff like chop-suey. in that, i was not disappointed. with a couple of exceptions, their menu could have come out of a chinese restaurant in the midwest circa 1970.   i was, however, disappointed with the food, sadly. this is one of those places i was anxious to like--a real throwback and a survivor. but truly, the food was not good. in fact, my egg foo young tasted a little spoiled. i threw it away and ate the friend won tons they gave us. the rest of the food, according to my family, was not that bad, but nothing great. even the spicy dishes tasted rather bland.   i do love the look of the place, and the service was friendly and efficient. i hate to give it a two star review, but i can't muster any more than that right now.",0
"the food here is worth all of the negatives- the wait, the service, the atmosphere. sometimes you just need that hearty breakfast to start your day, and palatte just won't succeed.  i recommend everything here. seriously, everything. especially the daily specials.",1
"holy crap. not only is this place in an awesome location but it has one of the few menus that i literally could not decide what i wanted to eat.  it's a strange little corner spot that nourish occupies and the layout is a bit on the minimalist side but that's okay.  they have a nice patio and their air conditioning system does a good job keeping you cool inside.  the hostess and waitresses were all very nice and helpful and really everything is very appealing about this place when you come in.  now let's get down to the food.  so many things to choose from.  we started with some mac & cheese and with a bowl of chili.  the mac & cheese is not your creamy style but rather the crunchy kind.  that's not really what i want when i order mac & cheese but this stuff was really tasty.  the three bean chili was really good.  it was pretty spicy though, so be prepared.  for my entree i went with the spicy southwest burger with a side of sweet potato fries.  i had the burger on a challah knot.  it was a strange compound of potatoes & beans made into a patty topped with avocado and cucumbers.  sounds weird but it totally worked.  i would order extra cucumbers next time.  the satisfying crunch of them breaks up the soft textures of the potatoes, beans, and avocado.  the challah knot bun was awesome and one of the best pieces of bread i've ever had.  finally, the masterpiece of nourish is their sweet potato fries.  i will go on record as claiming these to be the best sweet potato fries in the valley.  that means better than fez and way better than delux.  they are air fried which means they are healthier than your normal fries & they are lightly covered in cinnamon (and something else i can't quite decide).  the thing that makes them so great is their accompanying side of dipping sauce.  i don't know what it is or what god they had to kill to procure it, but it should be bottled and sold.  the combination of the two makes nourish worth the stop if only for a mid-shopping trip snack.  you don't have to be a vegan to come here but at least it is a place you can go and get normal food & keep your friend's dietary needs in mind.  check it out.",1
"the cookies are amazing.  i always buy a few to take home.  they need more meal selections for lunch in my opinion.  also, they tend to run low on iced tea a lot.  food is really great though.  sit outside for a quieter atmosphere.",1
"sometimes you wish god, oh just this once, would grant you the power to reach right through your computer screen and smack some doofus on the other side.  well, i've come to make this request to a higher power.  the negative reviews about the rusty spur make my head swim like it would after a pull of mezcal straight from the bottle.   this place is tip-fucking-top.  you don't want to be pressured to tip the band?  then pay a cover.  would that make ya feel all better?  no cover to enjoy a genuine texas (read: ""real"") country band?  holy smokes, they will even do covers of robert earl keen and pat green.  go to any other shite bar in the city and ask them if they know that.    the place is tiny, which lends to its charm.  this place is straight out of luckenbach and these suburbanites don't even know the characteristics of an 'outlaw country' bar.  waylon and willie would be proud of this place.  plus, they serve shiner bock in a bottle.  unreal.    the dance floor, which is a misnomer, more like a shuffle floor is absolutely legit in accordance with the rules of a texas dance hall, except for the fact that you bump into tables instead of only other dancers.  go watch urban cowboy and tell me that you need your dance space.  get over it.  .... and .... and! ... ""beans"" in the chili?  wtf?  this ain't canada.  hell, this aint even ohio!  beans should never disgrace a proper pot of chili.  jesus.  what the reviewer who mentioned that has just informed me is that they make their chili proper.  but i'd never know because i go in here to hoot n holler n get rowdy with the rest of the crowd ... drink a shiner and dance a little two-step to merle ... not stuff my face like a tourist.  christ.  i'm in no way a regular here, but this place is one of the very few legitimate country bars, not only in phoenix, but worldwide.  i've been in enough to know.  it should be regarded very highly for its genre.",1
i'm loving the cochata so much that i swung by twice this past weekend. whoever came up with this coffee and horchata concoction is a genius.  now i only wish america offered a soyrizo breakfast burrito. will you please do this for me and all the soyrizo lovers in the melrose?   thanks in advance.,1
"the food and wine are amazing.  you have to enter through a side door.  the place looks and feels like an underground cellar.  you can't go wrong ordering the cheese fondue or any number of the small bites.  i will say that i tend to avoid the nights there is a jazz band playing, it tends to get too loud for my taste.  there are lots of couples milling around, so either you'll love it or hate it.  larger groups have a harder time being seated and i will say that there can be a line for the restrooms.",1
"it was a struggle for me to choose between 2 stars or 3.its more of a 2.5 but do i want to give them the extra edge?  no  anyway i got a regular cheese pizza and for 10 bucks it ended up being   1)sour dough crust wtf, who doesn't metion the crust taste like the most sour sourdough ever?  2) it actually tasted similar to peter piper pizza  3).........................(dots equal drum roll) it was the size of large burger. seriously it was about equal to 2  and a half normal slices.   this pizza tasted like shit and for 10 dollars i can go to grimaldis and get an awesome pizza triple the size and quadruple the quality.   p.s. the waiters uniform makes them look like tools. like they work in a country club. you know what i'm talking about if you been there.",0
"the stuffed bell pepper looked good, but i had to send it back twice to get it hot (which seems to be a theme for this restaurant) got it steamy and then had to use the seasonings at the table to make it tasty.   this restaurant is busy due to default. it's convenient to the movie, reasonable priced and quick.   their lack of flavor and heat is standard. i wish they'd get a little heavier handed with the garlic & oregano. a garlic knot should clearly taste garlicky!   their house salad is a good deal and if you stick to a slice of pizza it's okay.  they have done some work on the interior that is an improvement and looks nice.",0
"i just moved in across the street. so i have been walking here and grabbing a pastry and or a mocha.   this place has two entrances, one in the rear, or the main door located right off of roosevelt.   the staff are very very friendly, even the people whom frequent this spot are very pleasant, i struck up a conversation with a man while i was waiting for my mocha just the other day.   i stopped at the fair trade cafe just up the street and that place is rated very highly but i had a horrible experience there so i recommend this place much more over the latter.",1

"this bar is in a good location if you're in the downtown stadium district but ... i ordered two car bombs and rather than bring them to me, the server came back and informed me how much they would be. okay, so go get them. then he comes back with a can of guinness and one shot. he sets down two glasses and looks at me and says ""oh, did you want a shot too?"" then he brings me my check and the car bombs are not on it. i had to remind him to go back and add them to my tab because i was leaving... immediately.",0
"strange layout that makes you think you got the worst table in the house no matter what table you're at.  wait staff and the general manager (wtf?) standing around doing nothing in a mostly empty restaurant while customers wait and wait.  it all comes off as the biggest tourist trap on stetson ave, even though the original barrio cafe is a local institution, and the prices are actually very reasonable.  food and margaritas were all amazing, but  when the front of the house doesn't seem to care if i'm there i won't be back.",0
"meh... i am not a fan. i went here for happy hour one time, and i was beyond disappointed. they must've had their d list chefs working... cuz my food was gross. i couldn't even finish it. kinda sucks spending that much money on nasty sushi.",0
"this place is a great addition to the little restaurants in sheridan square.  i can't say much for the interior, i'm not a fan of exposing the bare bones of a building and calling it ""décor.""  however, i still found it comfortable inside.  i ordered a stella (on tap) and a margherita pizza.  the pizza was good.  i found the dough comparable to red devil, although, still not as good.  the sauce reminded me of this delicious spaghetti sauce that my mom learned how to make when she lived in italy.  she uses grape tomatoes and that's what this sauce tasted like, i enjoyed it, i thought it added a nice flavor to the pizza.  by definition, a margherita pizza should have garlic, this one didn't have any.  the basil had been chopped up and again, the pizza typically calls for whole pieces.  all in all, i'd give the pie 3 stars.  i'm kicking in an extra star for the amazing service from rizzo the bartender, he made my day.",1
"i can't tell you how many times we've driven by this place and said we should try it. i so wanted to like this place. it's in a non-descript mall that has been re-inventing itself for years and is still nothing to look at aesthically, so walking into the grind is a bit of a shock to the senses. it's dark, trendy and kind of has an upscale feel to it. so far so good. it was busy, another good sign, and i'm having high expectations of this place. but they were short-lived.  we wanted to sit and enjoy our drinks for a while, but after the server asked us multiple times if we were ready to order, we decided we'd better do just that. i'm not sure where they had to go to prepare the food, but we waited an awfully long time for our burgers. when they arrived, we were all overwhelmed. the turkey burger was blah, tasteless and dry; the sweet & spicy burger as well as the steakhouse blt were overcooked. the sweet potato fries were limp and flavorless.  all this disappointment and super overpriced to boot! a lot of very good burger restaurants can be found in the phoenix area - several in the general vicinity of the grind! i hate to write off a place after the first visit (unless it's a major disaster) because it could just be a fluke. but having read some of the other reviews, i'm not sure our experience was a one-off. but it will be a while before i circle back to this place.",0
"i really love the atmosphere. cool and unique decor.  we have been here for brunch a couple times and enjoyed ourselves. but we only saw a plane take off once... must not be a very busy airport.  bloody marys are awesome here. so tasty, with just the right amount of kick.  food is pretty good, but the portions are kind of small. i love their veggie omelet with goat cheese. the potatoes would have been good if they were fresh but they taste like they were sitting for a few hours.   they also have a beautiful patio and are dog friendly. when the weather isn't crappy anymore we plan on taking our dog with us for a leisurely brunch.",1
"love this place! food is great and so is the cheesecake! during the weekend the wait for a table can be pretty long and i'm not sure if they take reservations or not. staff is nice and always ask you if they can get you something else. the portions are huge! i ordered a salad off of the ""skinny"" menu they have and it was still humungous! food isn't the best for you but it is really good. the menu is huge here so if you are a picky eater than this place is the best place for you since there is so many items to pick from! always have a good experience every time i come here!",1
not open when they say they're open.  door clearly says 11 am.  do not appreciate making a special trip to mill ave. for 11 am beer & lunch to discover they've decided to not open until 3pm for awhile because they're new.  thanks for the inconvenience.,0
"a 5-star performance in a 2-star venue - that's what it was when i recently went to the marquee.  to be fair - there was some good.  it's conveniently located and, as far as i know, i didn't contract any strange diseases while there.  now, the rest.  first strike - our experience trying to park.  first led into the tiny parking lot then told it was full by staff who seemed like it was their first day on the job.  how to get out?  they weren't sure.  what?  okay, parked across the street - still plenty of time for the show.  then - the clusterf*ck that was the line to get in, aided by the total lack of signs differentiating between those there to buy tix and those with tix.  no rhyme, no reason.  strike two.  inside now - to the bar for a refresher.  $7 for a warm, flat beer served by a guy that acted as if it were solely my fault he had to work that night.  strike three.  the show, as mentioned, was solid.  there are no bad seats (standing spots) in the place, though the acoustics are sort of like playing a stereo in a large closet.  it would take a band i really, really want to see to bring me back.",0
"z pizza is outstanding value for gourmet pizza. i usually go here for lunch as i work downtown and its just a quick walk. for 7 bucks you can get two slices and a soda not too bad. on average there are about 6 speciality slices to choose from. today i ate the moroccan and the italian followed by a single slice of pepperoni. the staff is super friendly and the little pizza place is nice and clean. this is a good place to enjoy lunch and have a view of the light rail. it makes you feel like you are truly in a metro! pizza is a little bit buttery, the slices are thin and the toppings are fresh. good pizza!",1
"pros:  the best bartender in phoenix, jonie, is now at the turf. it's not nearly as dirty as seamus. the patio is nice.  cons:  what's with the feeling that it is a music venue. the most empty space ever.  in no way do i feel like i'm in an irish pub. it would be better fitted in say, dc ranch where old douches could hang out and feel ""irish"" before they go home and bbq in the back yard while listening to jimmy buffett. there is no soul, feeling, or unique aspect of this place whatsoever.",0

"we were lucky enough to stop by here on a week night after the rush.  after a day of home searching, with no results, a nice quiet dinner is exactly what we needed.  and that it what we got!  our waitress quickly greeted us, brought us our sangria and wine, both were tasty and  the price wasn't bad. she was friendly, and did a great job.  the place was clean, with a warm glow from the pizza oven, it felt like a hug in there.  so nice.    we started with bruschetta, it was good.really the traditional tomato, mozzarella, basil, and balsamic shone, sometimes the original just cant be beat.  we then went on to the margherita pizza, something i had been craving for months since i had seen a picture of it in a phoenix magazine.  those beautiful dollops of mozzarella, rather than being drowned in rubber cheese, are the stuff dreams are made of. this pizza did not disappoint.  the other we tried was the schreiners sicilian sausage, again, simple and delicious.    we really enjoyed our meal here, and will be back.",1
"this truly is my fave deli in phx. my friend adan treated me to this lil secret spot and i decided to follow him on his food suggestion to get, the d.a.m. sandwich. pork roast rubbed with southwestern spices, pulled and marinated in a jalapeño and onion barbeque sauce. topped with the duck's famous coleslaw. served on onion roll. is your mouth watering yet?  there's a lil something for everyone on this menu; from your true carnivores to your dedicated vegetarians.   aside from the amazing food the ambiance is just awesome. you can either take a seat out on the patio (which you pass by on your way in) or you can sit anywhere theres a table and chair inside. my fave spot, is back by the wine cellar and beers. yes! that's right if you'd like you can purchase a bottle of your liking to go or have the bartender there open it for you to enjoy with your lunch.   they also have a great lil store area to pick from herbal teas, to handmade cards and organic rices. great place overall and i just can't wait to introduce someone to it so they can enjoy it as much as i have.",1

"drinking + arcade games. this should be an obvious winner, right? wrong.  oh, how wrong.   eating here is like eating in a casino, only less classy and with worse food.   beers are overpriced but absolutely necessary to make it through the event.   those combo deals that include beers and a game card seem like a good idea, until it's 45 minutes later, you're out of points, you're nowhere near drunk and you've already spent $40.  if you go late, try not to get syphilis when you walk by san felipe's.",0

(http://www.yelp.com/biz/chdjxllknwixbxpdwegb_a).  sure, it's a hole in the wall kind of place, but it worked.  my friend told me about their new fancy chandler location (it's a 2nd location, not a replacement) and i figure i have to give it a shot.    oh my goodness!  this place is a completely different experience than the phoenix location.  original phx location - bad old linoleum floors.  new chandler location - stained concrete.  original - limited seating, with tables and chairs seemingly borrowed from a church social.  new - tons and tons of seating, in tables that look like they belong in a restaurant.  original - small spot in an old ""seen better days"" strip mall.  new - really huge space in, well, a fancy new version of a strip mall behind a walgreens  thank goodness some things never change.  the food is just as great at this new location.  mexican, carribian and asian all mixed together on one menu.  jade pork in a quesadilla with chicken fried  rice and spicy black refried beans.    if you're at all confused about how it works i suggest you either go to their web site to their ""menu demo""  or better yet just go there one day for lunch or dinner.  everyone will find something they like.  as andrew mentioned, filling out the menu ticket isn't quite as important at this location, but i still absolutely suggest it.  take a few, you and your friends all fill them out at the same time, debating the merits of each potential combination and then ya get in line to order.  it's half the fun.  and of course the other half is the eating.  yum!",1
"we went here before a roller derby bout, based on the reviews on here. there were 6 of us, 4 adults and 2 kids. honestly, it was a disappointing trip.   it was a saturday evening, and the place was already getting busy, but they only had one server. and she failed. miserably. four of us sat for over 15 minutes with empty drinks, and it took my friend getting up and going to find her to get refills. it took almost 45 minutes to get any food on our table. we had ordered the cheese curds and pretty much as soon as they came out, they brought our food out. again, empty drinks. our server never came back to check on us, took forever to get us our checks, and my friend had to get up and find her again so we could pay. completely unacceptable.   about the food: i think the best things on our table were the cheese curds and the mini corn dogs. the burgers were ok, not great. they were all cooked until they were extremely dead and grey and weren't these amazing patties that everyone else on here is raving about. the flavour was good, but mine was dry and really disappointing. everyone else's had the same problem. i've never seen so many over-cooked burgers in my life. but at least the mini corn dogs were good! they were just crunchy enough, with the breading being just the right combination of salty and sweet. i don't know if they're homemade or not, but regardless, they were still good. the cheese curds were pretty decent too. beer battered and gooey, with tons of ranch. my sweet potato fries were good, as were the regular beer battered one.   oh, and just a side note: while we were sitting there, some random drunk woman gets up from the bar, comes over, puts an arm around our youngest kid, holds up a cell phone and says, ""do you know who this is?"" seriously, lady? who does that? you don't go up to a child you don't know, touch him, and show him something on a cell phone that no one else can see. turns out it was her and a football player, but still. the bartenders need to learn when to cut people off, and she should have been cut off about 4 gin and tonics ago. i've never been somewhere where someone made it a point to come over and touch my kid.   so all in all we were extremely disappointed in our visit to the original wineburger. i felt i had to apologise to my friends because we went there based on my recommendation, based on these yelp reviews. our burgers weren't any better than what i could find for $4 at other really good burger places, our service was non-existent and we had drunk patrons coming over to touch our kid. will we be going back? i don't think so. and i don't think i'd recommend it to anyone either.",0
"this restaurant is the one that my husband and i disagree with the rating the most. he swears by this place. the atmosphere, the food, the service. he thinks it's all great. however, after being drug here a half a dozen times or so, i hate to say that i find nothing special about harlow's. it is always very busy, but not in a busting, upbeat way. more like people running around frazzled and disjointed. the service is average. the waitstaff does their job, but they aren't overly friendly. the food is average to less than average quality. i always order breakfast items, so i can't comment on their lunch menu. however, in my experience at harlow's, french toast is french toast. a muffin is a muffin. and that's it, really. the atmosphere is kind of dismal to me as well, but i have yet to put my finger on as to why it feels this way.  i want to love this place, i really do, but harlow's has yet to prove anything special to me. perhaps i'll be back, but if i'm honest it would take quite a big change for me to catch onto the hype.",0
"this place is awesome. i spend an entire day walking around vintage stores in the area, and this place has the best stuff and the most reasonable prices.   i got a 60s couch for $300 bucks. can't beat that with a stick.",1
"yes very good and lots of great little side dishes to mix in with your entree.  kim chee tofu stands out. for me.  might be a little pricy her but don't come here to save your money. im new to korean food but this place seems to make people happy, sorry for all those hater reviews when you this famous that seems to attract bad attitudes.  hmm, well i don't think its a sushi house but people keep on rating this place like that is their specialty.  i would focus the attention to the home cooked korean food it has to offer.  and when i ask my korean friends they seem to prefer takamatsu.    i liked scotts w's  review, unbiased and funny",1
"food was amazing, as usual, but service was so incredibly slow! they weren't even busy! i don't get why the service is so slow here. there were only 4 of us and our server seemed so stressed out and rushed the entire time, until we needed the check and then she took forever splitting it since she forgot we requested separate checks before ordering.  i will still come back because i love their food and they have great wine specials just wish the service was better!",0
"damn you, mi patio, for being so far away! hubby and i tried this place because we had a restaurant.com certificate (and because loco patron in ahwatukee doesn't accept the certificates anymore - super lame), and because of the reviews here. yes, the guy who takes you to your table doesn't say a word and just throws the menus down, but who cares?! the fabulous food makes up for it! we started out with the red chile & cheese dip, and wow, it was sooo tasty! oh, and i can't forget the delicious salsa! my hubs is a salsa fanatic and loved it. then came our entrees: baja chicken burro for me and the #97 (chile relleno, cheese enchilada, beef taco, rice & beans) for hubs. everything was so flavorful that i think i moaned with pleasure a few times while eating. i definitely can't wait to go back!!",1
"always heard the advertisements for this place on the radio. was given the impression it was a real hip place to go. well, when you see the outside, the big cadillac and the entrance with all the license plates, you think you're in for a treat. it's just a facade. get inside, sit down. you realize they keep the place inside too cold. at least the bathrooms are clean. i ordered the bacon wontons because that was the cheapest thing on the menu ~$8. when i got it, i was shocked by the small portion. you get used to the taste, but when i was done, i felt a little nauceous. maybe cream cheese and maple syrup isn't the best combination? for your money and time, go elsewhere.",0
"i've been here twice now for happy hour and both times left feeling very unimpressed. the first time we were there was for happy hour since we were told that it was $2 wells and half off of some food. score! right?!...  kind of. i had ordered a blood orange vodka premium drink that was $4 and okay tasting, while my friends got wells. our waitress appeared to be out of it, rarely checked on us and over charged us on our bill ($4 for wells and premiums? that just doesn't make sense) and when we questioned it, she said she was not sure and asked her manager. the manager i guess had squared away the bill, we paid and went on our way. my friends who bill was wrong ended up having the original pricing charged to her card.  why we decided to return baffled me but friends were there so we met up again. i think it was the allure of $2 wells and us thinking that maybe by then they had their servers better educated for happy hour service. plus i was hungry,...wrong! our server this time was better, but again when it came to the bill had charged us $4 for wells, and had to talk to the manager, again, who thankfully took care of us.   now for the food. i ordered the pork tacos with mango salsa. the tortillas were delicious but i had wished there was a bit more pork on there and more salsa, it just wasn't very much. but for $3 i wasn't really complaining either! i'd probably get it again and ask for more of the mango salsa on the side.",0
"definitely worth going for their lunch special! you get soup and salad with your meal. the husband and i ordered pad thai and drunken noodles, both were delicious. the pad thai is the best i've had, outside the city (nyc). the service is very fast (and they were full to their capacity) and still nice.",1
"do you know what they have at butterfields?  they have a belgian waffle (and i capitalize because it's important here) with crumbled up bacon in the waffle...in the waffle!  they cook the bacon into the waffle right in the old waffle iron:)  well...next to a bacon filled old fashioned donut, this may the closest we get to a perfect ten in ""food combinations/breakfast division"":)  the beautiful carin and i needed a little sustenance on sunday morning and found ourselves reasonably close to butterfields (actually, we were right down the street from the breakfast club, but who needs that cluster:)  we hadn't been to butterfields for several months and the time was ripe for ""revisit"" so i could ""score the review"":)  i'm pretty glad we did!  summertime is probably a better time to get your butterfields fix...on a sunday in january the wait gets a little crazy...north of an hour with a line of dame edna lookalikes standing at the counter asking if their table is ready because they're sure they felt their pager go off...it didn't really go off...just the friction of teflon against titanium in their hip replacements every time they shift their considerable bulk:)  this past sunday, the wait at 12:30 was zero minutes:)  butterfields is technically a ""chain""...three locations separated from each other by thousands of miles...they don't feel like a chain:)  they have a bunch of nice touches at butterfields...a big mechanical juicer where they feed crates of oranges in the top and fresh juice comes out the bottom...heavy cream for the coffee (a truly delightful ""bloom"" of cream when you pour it in the coffee:), vermont maple syrup and other nice, high quality touches:)  the menu runs from a selection of benedict's (including the bubba, with gravy and sausage instead of canadian bacon and hollandaise) to a selection of assorted dutch babies and apple pancakes.  i've tried a bunch of these tasty little treats and they are serious health food (by which i mean that if you eat here too often, you will need to see your healthcare professional...seriously:)  but, back to the aforementioned waffle...you order that, a side of sausage, two sunnyside up eggs ( which you slide onto your buttered waffle)...syrup the whole thing and eat until the pee stick says you're approaching a diabetic coma:)  carin had a nice breakfast, too!   some sort of omelet!   she said it was good, but i forget anything else after the sugar shock took me down:)",1
"love this place. the atmosphere is so adorable.  i would highly recommend it for a girls night out, a date, maybe rent it out or see what they can do for an engagement party or rehearsal dinner.  it's just such a cool little place, with lots of delicious wine and food options.  i would also highly recommend making a reservation because it can get packed, and the wait can be in excess of an hour... easily.  valet is available, or about twelve spots on the street.",1
"love, love senor taco!! love the fact that my food is always tasty and piping hot, and stays consistent. also, gotta love the late hours and friendly service.   plus, if you don't feel like dining in, you can always swing through their drive-thru...",1
"i had a flat tire twice in one week (my kind of luck) on two different tires and went here and had the most top  notch service and the most helpful and accommodating staff at any discount tire i have ever been to.  i would recommend this location and the way this staff treats the customers to be the example of training for all other stores.  i was in and out in less than 30 minutes each time, no charge as i had the insurance and just really very happy.",1
"tempe improv always delivers a great night, i have two small issues with the improv, first is you are always packed in like a sardine and this is a bit uncomfortable, the second is the drinks are really watered down.   great date place and super fun for a group of friends to go to!",1
"lola's coffee is better than fair trade coffee (4 blocks away). other than that, it's just a coffee shop, nothing more, nothing less.   one couch, two comfy chairs a table and the rest are rather ridged metal chairs. the high ceiling gives the place a airy if not vacant feel.   they do have lots of space for laptops and lots of outlets to go with.  the coffee is ... well ... it's coffee. nothing outstanding nothing horrible, but it doesn't come anywhere near the awesomeness of lux or conspire.   the the biggest complaint i have is they only have one set of stereo speakers so the music comes from one area of the room and just bounces around the single room venue.",0
"3 girls on a thursday night decided steak sounded necessary.  as two of us waited for the 3rd girl to arrive our waiter stops by and says 'when is your friend getting here? i don't want to explain the menu a bunch of times.'  uh ok.  we ordered the bacon wrapped scallops to start. believe it or not it was my first time having scallops! i am not a big seafood eater but i would eat these again. tasty.   while we browsed the menu trying to make a selection the waiter came by and was like 'will you close your menu when you're ready so that i don't have to keep coming by your table?'   blank stares from us.   seriously? wtf?   we're chatty girls wanting to enjoy a nice, not rushed dinner.   he pops by again and asks if we're ready. thankfully one of my friends has more balls than me and says 'my menu is still open and i'm following your rules so...'   and he walked away.  we closed our menus to signal our waiter and we ordered escargot, prime rib, salads, soup etc.  the escargot was another first for me! it was tasty but i wouldn't order it again. glad i tried it though!   my prime rib was ok, definitely not the best i've ever had. we also ordered the creme brulee and it was good...nothing amazing.   while this was a place of many first for me, it will be my first and last time visiting bc of the rude waiter.  the prices aren't worth the food and service.",0
"we came here for restaurant week.  the crab cake was ok.  the signature coconut shrimp was rubbery.  entrees were the ribs which were ordinary and seared tuna which had zero tuna taste.  truly the worse part of the meal was the ""dessert"".  again signature coconut cake and chocolate brownie with ice cream.  the coconut cake was topped with this layer of stale coconut.  it wasn't soft and fluffy or toasted crispy.  it was stale as it had been sitting in the kitchen exposed to the elements for days!  the chocolate brownie was actually even worse.  it was hard as a brick.  they could have very well been serving us those fake desserts many restaurants bring over at the end of the meal to show what they offer.  save your money and go anywhere else.",0
"i can't say i'd bother going here again since there are much better options. my salad although good crisp lettuce had a processed chicken on top that wasn't good and the spicy chile dressing they splashed on, although i asked for dressing on the side, was too hot!  made it inedible.  if your looking for cheap beer until 7:00 pm and fried foods, you may like this spot.  definitely no shortage of tv's.",0
"behold and beware the power of mexican chiles in action  that was the theme of our first time here. mh ordered the steak tampico, marked as a 3 pepper dish. seeing what followed with him was entirely new to me. if you can see a brown person turn red, you know it's hot.   his take: ""among the spiciest things i've ever eaten, better than sinus medication if you have a cold"". hotter than the most diabolical chicken wings that we had together and needed 2 full pitchers of water with. evidently the chiles in the red sauce which covered the bottom of the plate spread into the guacamole, the lettuce, the tomato, the olive ...  the white sauce on top performed the same function for the steak ...   although he finished about half, which is usual. i wonder how long the effect will last and am monitoring the situation ...   our server was friendly and attentive. the chips and salsas were filling. my chicken ? dish was fine. didn't see why sour cream is an (expensive) extra. the flour tortillas on the side were ok, but bland. nothing to compare with el sol. the plates were cute, as they had the name of the restaurant  handwritten and fired into the various bright colors ...   the menu had photos, a little blurry but nice touch. maybe it's just me but i'm not really fond of burritos and chimichangas swimming in sauce. not that i got either this time, but if i do a special request would definitely be in order.   overall, i don't think the quality of the food is worth the price. ok, but ordinary. i may go again, being married to a hot food junkie, but who knows - the effects of this particular mouth-burning may go deeper than i think. time will tell ...   off to give him an acid pill :-)",0
"i still like lux better. cartel is very appealing, though, to those who know their coffee. the menu is not huge, but it does offer basic, good drinks.  they have plenty of syrups to flavor your drinks, if that's what you're into. i like the atmosphere in there, and the bike wheel ""art"" is pretty interesting and unique. this place is probably really great to study in, considering the fact that i see a sea of macbook apples every time i walk in here.  the employees are funny and nice. anyway, it is definitely worth checking out.",1
"so my last review was quite favorable...  they took away the dart boards. they put tvs everywhere, like a sports bar. the service (minus the two regular girls) has gone to shit. food has gone downhill. i remember saying how the food was high quality and good. not so much anymore. ownership is just not getting it. i've had lots of conversations with chris because i do not want the local pub to close down. the place has been a ghost town as of late, and there are reasons why.  1. don't take away stuff that people enjoy doing. you may think it isn't profitable, but when people come to the bar and find a game they like, then they stay longer. thus they drink more beer.  2. don't close earlier than you say you are going to, and don't cut kitchen service off early. people remember that. the next time they are hungry or thirsty they will go elsewhere that they know is open.   3. train your employees. they used to make regular rounds on the patio and to the tables. nowadays you are so understaffed that if you don't walk to the bar, you ain't getting a drink.  4. get some fucking coors light! you have been out of it every time i've been there in the past month (9-10 times) and that is ridiculous. i hope you guys are reading this. i really do. you're going to mess up a good thing.",0
"sip your cup-o-joe in the former mechanic's bay of this historic gas station turned hip coffee house by my gradeschool friend, bill sandweg. bill and his wife bring their years of restaurant management and service experience to this delightful addition to the 7th avenue neighborhood. the pastries are home made.  you've no excuse to escape your work either. free wi-fi is just a couple of clicks away. the close quarters of the former garage make for easy conversation with strangers, now new acquaintances about politics, ev mecham or even your most recent yelp review.  take advantage of the drive-thru, starbucks-style as you drive past the antique gas pumps out front. all told, it's a great stop, and you can support another wonderful local business.  four stars 'cause they close at 9pm (as of the writing of this review). i wanna hang out tempe-coffee-plantation style like in my asu days.  thanks, bill.",1
"i went here with the bf, my brother, his gf, and my niece and nephew yesterday for lunch. the place is cute, i like the way they have made the restaurant look...comfortable, yet modern. all of the food was delicious. i tried the seoul pizza and it was delish...spicy, sweet, crunchy....just awesome. the crust was perfectly crunchy. the pizza was big enough for two people and only cost 9$. i also tried the monkey bread (really tasty little garlic knots) and the chop salad (not my fave, but i don't really like chopped salads generally). also, they serve hamm's! can't beat it. i may just become a regular here.",1
"what can i say about blue martini? this place has become the new barcelona in my opinion. cougar centrale! it is definitely an older female demographic. now my opinion has been formed by just one jaunt into this place, but i'm sure it's the same on any given night. there will be the older drunk guys dancing with some woman they wouldn't want to be seen with on any other night. drink prices weren't outlandish which you would sort of expect.   there are four bars in this joint. so getting a drink should be easy right? negatory. it was like waiting for hailey's comet to order something. plus you have to deal with the db guys muscling their way in trying to jump the line.   overall, if you are desperate for a place to go in citynorth, this is probably the ""classiest"" joint there. not sure i will be going back ever.",0
"you may have to wait for clearly some of the best burgers in az..or the west for that matter.. i dont really eat red meat, but every now and then..if worth it..i will shock my system.. go ahead and cheat with the fries..they come in a cutesy shopping cart with aioli.. do it! my buddy had a burger....all engrossed with cheese and bun and sauce..i had to try it...it was orgasmic! but i love me some asian salad..and i ordered that after i inquired as to what it was earlier as it was delivered to the table next to me... it is a huge salad.. huge!!! yummy thai peanut dressing and another dressing on the spicier side comes with too... we sat in the middle..the long counter with blue lights.... we were seated on the patio..but the drip system...well, was drippy! so they happily moved us.. martinis and wine ... very good...staff very nice and accomodating..he even gave us a sweet little discount..i wont say why.., but he liked us.:-) ;-) .. but we gave it back in tip... my guy friend got a dessert next door...@delux to go... looked yum...but i dont have the metabolism of a guy so i choose to not....",1
just as expensive and crappy as their main location. but it was the only place in the vicinity for booze. then got hungry and had a salad that was 12 freakin dollars for hardly anything. what a joke. lame!!! stay away people!,0
"it was great the last few times...  till i found a dried piece of spinach stuck on my fork when i unwrapped the silverware, and dishes had crumbs encrusted on them.",0
"i was so excited to try this place but, unfortunately, it didn't measure up.  it was pretty vacant with only a few patrons in the bar and one couple in the restaurant.  it had the feeling of a place that isn't going to survive.  we got the mozzarella, tomato and garlic flatbread which was very lacking in flavor and the crust was soggy.  based on the waitresses recommendation, we also got the shrimp tacos.  they were ok flavor but, immediately fell apart - messy!  overall, the food was ok but the service didn't even rate that.  unfortunately, i won't be back as we are blessed to have so many other fabulous places in town.",0
"i was looking for a place to listen to some cool and funky live music and chars hit the spot. soul power seems to be a staple here, and they didn't dissapoint. the place is kind of a dive, reasonably priced libations, fun atmosphere, an all around good place to hear some decent music. it's got kind of a small dance floor and seating is pretty limited. you might want to try to get in early, or you might be standing. parking is kind of a bear, and you will generally need to find a spot in the neighborhood a few feet away.",1
"sadly  this isn' t as good the second time as the first time. the first time i was here the food seemed fresh and light and i really enjoyed a volcano sushi/ tartare  dish .. mmmm  but this time ..what happened   ?  the service was okay although for as empty as the place was , it seemed a  bit slow for refills and checking in.   akward sushi service , we were sitting at the bar and suddenly get  all our sushi at once on all different plates  ahhh  where do we put them , and no one has cleared our appetizer plates???   the rolls were big but sadly unmemorable.... something fried , something spicy tuna ish ,,blah blahdy  blah...  you get the picture.  the good ole boys sitting next us were kind of fun to watch. they were singing country songs, while watching football , cramming too big of pieces of sushi in their mouths..  it's not good when the slanted bathrooms are the most memorable part of your restaurant.  doubt i 'll be back.",0
"my new favorite local record store.   they have a great vinyl selection, especially the $1 12"" singles. i've picked up a lot of good classic disco 12"" releases from west end, etc here on the cheap. the new vinyl is decently priced. i just picked up the new radiohead record for i believe $12. another really awesome thing about this record store is the punch card they give you. 1 punch for each $10 you spend, 10 punches gets you $10 worth of free music. a record store certainly doesn't have to give you free music for buying music, you're going to do it anyways. pretty awesome!  i heard they're going to start hosting shows here on friday nights. sounds like i'll definitely have to come in a check this out. if you're a dj, this is essential for the 12"" finds. if you just love music, it's essential for everything else. staff is awesome and friendly as well.",1
"we first ate at roy's at their kauai location. i'm glad to say that their food is as good in the desert as in the middle of the ocean.   service is always good, food for the most part has been delicious, save a couple times were a new entree or appetizer didn't lived up to the waiter/waitress hype.  the drinks are very good, perfect blend of alcohol and mixers. i am not a wine connoisseur but the times i ordered wine by the glass i have been more than happy with my selection.  overall, good food and service.",1
"i won't spend too much time on this review because i don't particularly want to relive my evening again, but i can say this was my second and last trip to iruna.  tomato bread had no tomatoes, calamari was soggy and had no flavor (had to ask for salt and lemon), and hh specials were not offered (only available at the bar/patio--despite not saying that anywhere on the menu or website).  i'll give them credit for a solid snapper dish (at $5 a bite), and the server did recommend a nice tempranillo (although 2nd on his list behind the $15/glass of course).  the place was pretty empty until 9:00 on a friday, and the menu is fairly limited and pricey for what you get.  some may enjoy this place, and although there was nothing traumatic about my dining experience iruna is just a ""miss"" for me.",0
"this is a chain-franchise-knock-off. it's not good, it's not bad. it has the same value as fast food, but a little nice and therefore you will pay more. it's a place i visited while moving. i chose it because i could see it from the elliot street. the service was ok, but the food was far from impressing. i ordered the waitress corporate predetermined recommendation - and it wasn't good. it tasted like anything you can buy in the frozen meals section from the grocery store, prepared well. i will not be coming back.   .. und das ist was es ist",0
"burger shop where all i wanted to do was take the burger off and eat the rest.   small, cute, friendly, fast, great fries.   i ordered the sw burger, with pastrami and a green chili on it. the toppings were excellent but the bland flavorless burger was a disappointment. seriously it sucked away the greatness of the rest of the meal.   fries are great, great ranch dressing. onion rings were large and greasy..yum.  the kids and wife all agreed we probably will not go back. there are better places closer to home.",0
"pink taco is amazingly, stupendously, brilliantly... average!  nothing remarkable about this place except the name. average food, average service, average crowd.   i wonder if their marketing department ever expected that they could over-hype something so much that it would just let people down.  i am yawning as i am writing this.",0
"the second time i went back to this restaurant was peculiar.  the waitress started out clingy and constantly complimenting my friend, then she became very pushy about wanting us to leave.  she brought our check with 2 fortune cookies on top, came back 2 minutes later, then tossed the cookies onto the table and wiggled the check at us.  i was willing to write off this occasion since my first was so good.  i went back for a 3rd try and actually had to walk out because the service was so bad.    our group of 4 came in and said that we needed a table for 4.  the hostess showed us to a table with only 3 seats at it, then looked confused when we pointed out that we needed another chair.  she then showed us to another table with 3 seats, then started to walk away.  when we got her attention to point out that 3 seats are never adequate for 4 people regardless which side of the room it is on, she told us to go ""wait in line"" again.    technically there was no line, but we went back up to the front to wait for a 4th chair at either table.  while we were waiting for them to get their sh!t together, i noticed that the hostess was grabbing chairs from all over the restaurant and putting it at a table that did not have all of their dining partners.  i'm no restaurant owner, but it seems to me that it would be more important to seat people who are actually there!  my blood was starting to boil, but we were seated and i was willing to forgive.  we had our menus and we were ready to order, but we waited and waited.  i think it was 15 minutes before the waitress (the weird clingy one from my second trip) came to our table, we had no drinks, no nothing.  we realized how much time we were wasting and discussed getting our food to go before the waitress finally appeared at our table.  when we mentioned getting our food to go, she gave us the nastiest look then told us that we would have to go tell the hostess what we wanted.  i lost it.  i told the waitress that everything that we had experienced thus far was completely unacceptable and i wouldn't tolerate it.  i stood up to leave and she stood where she was (in my way), ignored me, and tried to take my dining companion's orders.  she finally backed off without even a glimmer of apology after my companion's realized that i really was leaving.   i will not go back here ever again, no food is worth this treatment.",0
"i am so sad to have to write this review. my boyfriend and i visited here for spa week yesterday and were really disappointed. having stayed at the montelucia as a hotel guest and an occasional lunch and dinner, i knew we could expect five star service, food and amenities and i was really excited to try this spa. when i saw it was having a spa week special for $79 for an 50min massage, i jumped on the opportunity! unfortunately, the joya spa didn't live up to my expectations.  booking over the phone was easy and i called prior to our massages to see if we would have access to the main pool post massage and to see if my bf and i could have a couples massage with the special. unfortunately, they couldn't accomodate us as a couple and 'spa only' guests aren't allowed to the main pool but we did have access to the spa rooftop pool. after looking at pictures and reading reviews, i was still excited.  upon entering the spa, we checked in with a smile-less hostest. the checkin area had two other guests so i was hopeful that spa week, on a monday at 1pm was slow and we could get the full experience. my bf and i and another guest were led up the stairs and given the tour. as a few have said, there are a few hokey parts about this spa. i love crystals as much as the next person but the whole ceremony where you pick your stone and then put your hand on the bigger crystal to say some sort of wish or prayer seemed a bit...well....cheesy...i could tell my bf just wanted to laugh but we went along with it. i'm all for trying something if it'll get me in a zen mental zone and relaxed.    around the corner, my bf and i were seperated into our own locker rooms. this normally is the case at spas but it would have been nice to get a little extra instruction on how to meet back up once our treatments were over. they swept us off into opposite directions so we had to coordinate via text. cell phone signals weren't the best either so if you go with a partner, make sure you have a plan beforehand.  the facilities are nice and i liked having my own personal locker with keycode. the spa was pretty busy with spa week though and as someone else mentioned, it definitely had more of a vibe of 'girls time' rather than 'relax time'. waiting in the 'social' room for my services definitely felt more social than relaxing. my therapist joel came to get me 5 minutes after my scheduled 1pm appointment.  joel took me back to the treatment room and the room was pretty uninspired. dark, a mirror on the wall and i think a small table with some water. when we went through the usual 'what do you want in your massage,' i mentioned that i had a headache to which he responded something like, 'who know's what could have caused it' and it was quickly dismissed. i was just going to ask for a little extra neck attention but he didn't seem interested? he left the room for all of 45 seconds but luckily i usually hurry to get on the bed so he didn't catch me mid-table-mount. lol  now for the massage...i'm sorry but this was the worst massage i've ever had. it was uninspired, never felt like he was in the right area and a few of the techniques i wanted to laugh. he pulled the foot rest out from under me without supporting my legs, wiped my hands with hot towels and left them dangling off the side of the bed, ran into the chair several times in the corner and gave a very awkward, 10 second head massage at the end.  i don't know if he was brought in to help with the busy week but its suffice to say i was glad it was over after 50 minutes.  when i finally met back up with my bf, he informed me that his massage was terrible too and that he was cut short 10 minutes from his massage. lucky him!  besides the disastrous massages, we had decided that we were going to have lunch poolside and luckily we were able to get chaise loungers right by the pool that were comfy. service was slow and my turkey burger was pretty bland. i was served my salad in a bowl where the sealant was coming off. i don't think i ate any of it but it was a little shocking to see once i finished my salad and noticed it. the view of camelback is nice but i would have perferred the main pool with its sprawling views of the mountain and resort.   upon check out i had been expecting the 20% additional tip included so i asked carlos to adjust it accordingly. when he asked why, we told him that our services were not in line with 20% and that we didn't like our massages. he just said 'okay'. other staff members were behind the desk and didn't seem to care either and we paid for our massages. he added too much for the tip for my bf's treatment but at that point, the extra $1 didn't matter and we wanted to get the hell out of there.   the only reason i'm giving it two stars is that i know what the montelucia is capable of and for the atmosphere of the resort as a whole. maybe we just had a bad experience because of spa week? i'm not going back to find out.",0
"another stop for my bachelorette party.  we were able to make a table reservation (thx gk!) here without having to do bottle service, which was great!  our group of 8 was shown to our table and immediately served drinks and shots and had a great time.  we were there around 10pm, so it wasn't too busy yet, but we had a good time anyway.  the ""stripper"" pole on the dance floor provided some good entertainment.    always a great place to hit up when in old town!",1
"this place was a total waste of money, time and effort. i went there with a friend after a late lab class. i ordered the brisket, which for me, is the standard for any bbq joint. anyways, our food comes out at room temperature. honestly, nothing is worse than room temp bbq. we were suspicious right away since the food came out so fast. anyways, when we complained to our server, he grabbed the manager who ended up comping the meal for us, which was nice. he explained that they smoke everything before, then finish it on the grill to order. obviously ours weren't grilled much (or at all). they were apologetic about it, but the server said that since he recognized my friend from coming in before, that it wouldn't be a big deal to comp it for us. but shouldn't you comp something like that for any customer? not impressed.",0
"i am addicted to bookman's.   i will go there with a certain amount of cash (usually $50) and promise myself i won't spend a penny more. yeah, right. as soon as i walk in, i smell the books.  some people don't like this smell, but as a voracious reader, i love it!  smells like home :} so, i browse the books for at least an hour.  sometimes, if i am looking for something specific, it won't take me as long.   then, off to the dvds.  i love the selection!  all those 80s movies and cheesy horror flicks! even got an xbox here last year and a bunch of games.   they even have belly dancing classes on sundays!",1
"it's the saturday night before christmas and the animals are sleeping at the phoenix zoo, well maybe not for the flamingos, i saw they will still up and ready to party, but the phoenix zoo was awake with bright twinkling lights and lots of christmas songs that would put even poor old mr. scrooge in the holiday mood.  if you haven't been to the zoo lights at the phoenix zoo, you should really try it, at least just once.  went to zoo lights with my daughter, son, grandson & family friends, we strolled the entire park, listening and singing along with the songs, everyone around us catching the holiday spirit.   we walked up to where the talking giraffe was telling stories, for my 2 year old grandson, it was kinda scary, but for me,  i got a kick out of it, the giraffe said what do you call a giraffe at the north pole???? lost!!! hahaha that busted me up!   we continued along the trail looking at the lights, eating our popcorn and drinking our hot chocolate and i thought what a perfect night at the zoo!  oh guess what, santa claus was their too with his sled taking pictures with boys and girls! my grandson got his 1st pic with good ole saint nick!  it's also the zoo's 50th anniversary too!   thank you phoenix zoo & srp for zoo lights!",1

"despite the name, pure sushi isn't for sushi purists...but if you're a fan of rolls, then good times may be found here.    pure sushi is all about monster rolls...with fillings that ranges from crabs to shrimp tempura to deep fried soft shell crabs...and over the top are things like salmon, halibut & scallops...and to top it all of, you get wide range of sauces from sweet onion salsa to sweet chili to  kiwi yuzu.   also good selection of bento box lunches though the loungy atmosphere and thumping music can feel slightly off in the bright phoenix noon day.    really just 3 stars for the food, but we added an extra star for the spacious patio and cool decor.",1
"went there before an asu game as two couples.  the server was pretty nice but very unprepared and kept forgetting things.  at one point, we made a bet that one girl would never get the lime in her beer that she ordered right when we sat down.  the bet against the lime won.  the manager did agree with us and worked to remedy the situation, but it took sooo long to get all of our food and drinks and half of it was messed up.  in no rush to return.",0
"describing the lost leaf, i feel like i shouldn't like it...but i really really do.  there is no signage out front so i was very timid approaching from the outside but once i did boy was i glad.  most of the art i have seen on the walls is so bad it is good. they rotate it out so i have to assume there is occassionally great stuff up.   no beer on tap? wtf? and i have never heard of most of the beers...thats ok, ask the staff for reccomendations based on what you like and you won't be disapointed. i had a beer in a wine sized bottle...how cool am i now?  in the back room they have live music and things of this nature. a stand up bass...i am in!  seriously this place in unpretentiously pretentious. or the other way around. one way or the other it is a great place to meet up and have a laid back great time.",1

"the deep fried barbeque ribs were decent.  tasted pretty good, nice caramelized sauce.  it comes with a yogurt sauce that complements it nicely.  they don't boil the meat which i'll give them props for.  the fries were awesomely crispy.  however, they were salty.  the 3 sauces the fries come with were very good, but i couldn't even see the salt on the potatoes to be able to brush it off.    the mussels were delicious!  the bread it comes with was actually too salty too, but i was able to brush off a lot of it, and dip it in the sauce to wash it out a bit.  the curry based sauce was very good this way.  this is the only dish i may possibly ever go back for.  very good.  the burger they had trouble getting going.  i ordered it medium, got it pretty much looking like raw ground beef in the middle.  they took it back and seems like cooked it just on the side i had cut it, the cut edge was brown but still raw beef in the middle.  they took it again and we thought they said they'd redo the whole thing.  we got it back with the bites missing, burned to a crisp on one side and still raw in the very middle on half the patty.  we all gave up and they took it off the bill and gave us dessert on the house.  the little bite i had was decent, seems like they seasoned it with soy sauce or something.  at least that's what i tasted before the burnt flavor overpowered everything.  however, its pretty tiny for a 12 dollar burger, which is pretty hefty already for a happy hour special.    the strawberry shortcake was pretty delicious.  i would prefer a little more shortcake but it was good.  overall not too sweet, edible creme (i usually don't like whipped cream or anything like that).  donut holes weren't bad, came with a nice sauce though it would be better as a thicker sauce.  chocolate pudding cake was delicious, though it's hard to mess up.  its like slightly raw brownie batter or chocolate lava cake.  yum.  the sweet potato cheesecake i was less of a fan of.  it starts tasting like sweet potato and ends tasting something like cheez wiz.   all in all, despite the kitchen mess up i wasn't too upset over it because they really seemed like they were trying to make it right.  our waitress was awesome, and the bar staff was great too while we were there.  the drink specials are awesome, the food specials not so much (as far as pricing goes).  the food isn't very impressive at all with the exception of the mussels.  maybe i'll go back far mussels and wine, but i really don't see anything else worthwhile.",0
"only the biltmore apple store can make the typical shopper (me) feel like a total douche just by walking inside of it to be exposed to the cultish behaviors of apple fanboys and girls.  this must be, like, the ganges of apple secularism.  one might introspect, ""is this me?""  no.  its okay.  you certainly aren't one of the tools extolling steve jobs father's testicles for blessing the planet with the divinity who created the most streamlined electronic products ever exalted on god's green ge.  but look around, and this is what you will see at this particular locus.  interacting with the sales associates, these coal-shirted devotees, is what i imagine muhammad faced when he met his 72 virgins in heaven.  these virgins, however, are massively haughty and generally useless.   in order for one of them to grace your presence and acknowledge your need for assistance, one must either 1) act like you're walking out of their store with one of their pretentious product under your shirt, or 2) make an appointment with their ""genius bar"".  f me running.  what a crappy state of affairs customer service is at this place.   let me get this straight, i cannot get anyone to help sell me overpriced, buggy apple products unless i had the foresight to book their arses a week before?  moreover, should the frequently occurring apple jinx strike my ipod, its gonna take an appointment to tell me that you cannot fix it because you are not, in fact, a genius, but a $10 an hour fandork of apple products and you wanted the 5% employee discount?  the 2 times that i've had problems with my ipod (i know, what a shocker!), they've just suggested that i reformat, thus erasing all of my files and losing playlists, et al.  thanks genius.  thanks for keeping up the good fight vs microsoft, dweeb.  and thanks for allowing me to check out -- not at the cashwrap, but right here, where we stand -- amongst the packed section of iphones, where people are dorking out to these things.  i appreciate the dapper service, even though i'm plopping down the loot for two 'pods (which will inevitably be returned for two new ones in a few short months after i stump the geniuses over at the bar).    now, i'm just blue-skying here, but how about you treat me like an actual human customer instead of an atm machine, given that i've purchased 6 or so apple products within the past 4 years?     i hate that apple has been crushing the portable music market for several years now because their outposts for customer service are absolutely abysmal.",0
"my son wanted to treat his boyfriend and me to dinner, wanted something near the theater we were headed too and something they haven't tried.  i saw humble pie was in the area and asked if they were game and yes they were. now i have heard good sold things about humble pie from many friends so i was pretty excited to try them out.    it was sunday night around 5:30, we walked in and where greeted right away and asked how many in the party, then the host turned his back , a server walked up and asked how many in the party, i had to answer because it appeared the host had better things to do, why even ask if you didn't even care.  we were seated handed menus and drink orders were taken.  for appetizers i ordered the toasted ravioli,  they were stuffed with ricotta cheese and served with marinara sauce. to be honest this dish lacked flavor, prego sauce has more flavor that the marinara sauce that came with it.  1/2 the raviolis were toasted perfectly, the other were just hard. even though the dish looked great the dish didn't wow me.   my son ordered the lasagna, which was the winning dish of the night, everything cooked perfectly!  his date ordered the penne with vodka sauce with chicken (5 buck upcharge, when it came out it looked like adding the chicken to the dish was an afterthought, it was just a chicken breast diced up lying on top of the pasta. the sauce had great color but lacked flavor.   since i was at humble pie, pie is what i am getting right?  wood oven cooked pizza sounded amazing!  i ordered the bbq chicken pizza with smoked mozzarella, bacon, fontina, green onions and bbq sauce, the bbq chicken is one of my favorite types of pizza, so i was pretty excited. when i got my pizza it looked pretty amazing, but when i started to eat it, i noticed it was covered with grease, even my crust was soaked in grease, i couldn't eat it all, my belly was becoming a grease pit, it was just too much for me.     our server was never around (it wasn't that busy) the food was ok, the place looks like a lot of fun, the lasagna rocked, but my return rate very low.",0
"what an experience - that's all i can say after a recent trip to the new portillo's in scottsdale!  we decided to brave the crowds on a saturday afternoon before a spring training game.  thanks to an early game we got a good start at portillo's around 11am, which i think somewhat helped with the crowds.  thankfully we found a parking spot quickly and hurried into the line that was already outside the door.  inside was packed and a bit overwhelming for a person who isn't too keen on crowds.  after placing our order one person in our party stayed in line to pay and two of us looked for a seat.  it took a good 10 minutes walking back and forth to finally get a seat.  people were pushing and shoving the whole time - not fun.  once we finally were sitting and our food was received, we all calmed down and scarfed our food.  i had a hot dog, which was fab.  i really enjoyed it!  the fries were great as well... only wish we would have gotten more!  the hubs had an italian beef sandwich and we really liked it.  he got it plain and said next time he wants peppers for sure.  we all really enjoyed the food here, though the crowds were crazy!  not sure it will get any better anytime soon, but perhaps in the future when i am brave again we will give this place a second go around.  for now, i will wait to see if the masses die down.... i doubt they will!",1
"one of my favorite tempe spots, forefathers really instilled in me a love for the philly cheesesteak sandwich. when visiting, i always order the 2nd cheesesteak option with white american cheese, and either a side of french fries or their equally excellent sweet potato fries. for those wanting to manage their portions, their sandwiches also come in smaller sizes. after placing your order, be sure to go to the small refrigerator across from the soda machine and get a side of their sweet peppers to accompany your sandwich. this place has great food, and along with it a comfortable, casual dining environment. it also has friendly ownership and staff. it's been a while since i lived in phoenix, but whenever i return and come to forefathers, there are people working here who remember me and welcome me back. if you check out forefathers, i am sure you'll want to come back again.",1
"want to know a secret on how to waste nearly $50 in less than an hour? come to rigatony's! my husband and i live right down the street from here and watched as it was being built wondering what it would be. when we found out it was a rigatony's i became disinterested. i have never eaten here and had no desire to, that is until my husband decided he wanted to try it. he knew it was an italian place and he likes to find new places where he can eat a bowl of pasta. i stalled going here as long as possible but friday night i finally gave in and we went to dinner here. i think we came in around 6, which i guess is right before the dinner rush because there was no wait, but when we left less than an hour later there was a line out the door. and thank god we didn't have to wait because the people who line up to eat here are total fools.  the service was quick and our waitress was really friendly. that is the only reason this place gets more than 1 star. she was quick to bring us water and take our order. we decided on the portabello cloud as an appetizer, which sounded interesting. i ordered the fettuccine alfredo and my husband ordered some seafood with pasta and cream sauce special that was being offered. salad and bread comes with the meal and luckily i had read before hand that the salad comes with salami so i requested the salad without it. the only way that i can really describe this place is a lower quality olive garden. and i hate olive garden. the salad is basically the same with lettuce, red onions, tomato, black olives, and peppers, but instead of a decent italian dressing that i can stomach, this one is coated with cheese and a heavy dressing. i barely finished one serving, but i watched as the table across from me (two women and one child) devoured two bowls of it. ugh. the bread was just ok. its just bread. our appetizer comes out and it was not what i was expecting. it was a portabello mushroom filled with cheese and a few smigens of tomato and spinach, deep fried and placed on top of a pool of basil cream sauce. if you don't care about fitting into your pants the next morning, this could be tasty.   our entrees were the same. low quality olive garden fare. my $12 fettuccine was an embarrassment to the name. i make amazing fettuccine for less than $12 that can feed four people!! do people actually come here and eat this garbage when you can make so much better at home?? and apparently there is flour in the sauce to make it thicker. not necessary and made me lose my appetite quite frankly. my husband liked his meal at the restaurant but started to feel sick as we were leaving and we took our leftovers home but they ended up in the dumpster on the way into our house because we couldn't stomach the thought of eating this food again. when we got the bill and our total came to $40 i about passed out. i had to leave the tip in cash because i couldn't stomach the thought of adding more to our credit card. what a complete waste of money. the food was bad. bad bad bad. heavy, greasy, everything was covered in cheese or some kind of cream sauce. i hope this experience made my husband realize that food can be so much better. i hardly ate the next day just to counteract the amount of calories i ingested in this meal.  one more note. i know this is a ""family restaurant"", but seriously. if your newborn baby is screaming its head off and the restaurant is full of people, please take the baby outside until it calms down. its just downright rude when you let the kid scream in a place full of people who didn't come there to listen to your baby scream.",0
"in two visits to hula's, i feel it is a strong two star establishment and there are several reasons why i feel this way.  food quality seemed good, but menu items i tried were fairly bland and not very interesting, though i do find this holds true at many ""hawaiian"" restaurants. drinks here are stiff and during happy hour you can pick up a nice buzz for very little money, and this is a plus. the restaurant is nicely designed and modern feeling, hence the name modern tiki.   televisions here, i'm assuming, are reserved for 50 year old batman movies, cartoons, and hawaiian videos, since that's the only thing i've seen on the screens. i never understand movies in a bar with no sound, they don't make very good background ambiance as they are designed to be heard and draw you in. if sports were on, it would be great because you can glance up every now and then between conversations and see whats going on. you don't have to watch a whole plot unfold.   my last visit, after a day of mountain biking with a friend on squaw peak, we stopped here for happy hour and sat on the patio. they turned on the fire pit for us and even though we were seated next to it, it provided little warmth. the fire pit did however overwhelm us with the odor of propane burning. oh well. we asked to split the bill, mine card and my friend's cash. we handed the it to the waitress and i said ""put the remainder on the card"" yet she came back with two separated checks... both charged to my credit card. i asked why i would want the bill split up on my card and where the cash went. she said she thought it was a tip ($13 when the bill was $22) and i said no, you were supposed to take the cash off, then put the rest on the card. please refund my card the amount of my friend's meal, and apply his cash toward that. she argued thats not right and refunded both meals on my card, took the cash, and said we were good to go. i signed the bill but i wonder if i was ever charged. she was doing her business a disservice with her awful, awful, serving skills.  on another visit, the bartender spent my entire time there acting like he was too cool to be at work, i was bothering him by making him do his job, and i wasn't welcome to sit there.  this could be a nice spot if they cleaned up the service problems and added a little oomph to the food. for now, i say it's a pretty restaurant with good stiff drinks. service and friendliness is half the battle though. unhappy/dumb as rocks staff = unhappy customers.",0
"i was very excited to see something nice move into this location.  fresh and easy is relatively inexpensive, but i'm always reminded that they don't accept coupons (they only accept their own coupons) or award a bag credit like most of the other grocery stores.  i do like that they have a hybrid parking space right up front for me.  pros - this store attracts some really nice people to this rundown strip mall area.    cons - most of the produce here is neither fresh nor easy.  in fact, i've seen many items pass their expiration date while they're still on the shelf.",0
"homey, delicious, unique.. all words that come to mind when i think back on my dinner here.  first off.. they do take reservations for party's of 5 or more. however a reservation at this small place really just means a bump up in line. do not go expecting to sit and eat right away. its a small place.. and is popular enough to keep it busy with at least one or two groups waiting outside during the weekend dinner rush.  this place is run by a husband/wife team and i can only assume the younger gentlemen was also part of the family. can you beat food prepared by someones mom/grandma? maybe if yours is from the region your menu is from. otherwise i highly doubt it.  the food:  bandeja paisa: this is what i came for. after watching anthony bourdain chow down on this in the columbian episode i had.. had.. had to have this. chorizo, chicharones con carne, fried eggs, fried plantains, plantain patacones, arepa, beans, avocado, carne asada and rice. the only way this could have been better would be to have more of it! how do you make bacon better? you leave the pork back on it and deep fry it. even with my cold everything tasted amazing.  empanadas: we had three types chicken, beef, pork. chicken: was in more of a flaky, buttery, pastry type shell. i would say this was more of a pot pie in a portable package. beef/pork: both of these were more traditional. my taste buds were a bit off so i had a hard time telling which was which. one of them was slightly sweet and freaking amazing. i could have sat and ate a dozen of those. i believe it was the pork one that was sweet.  seafood soup(sorry don't remember the name): i'm not a fan of things with fins unless they are in a fish tank ;) my friend has this soup. i was a little worried because it smelled very very fishy and supposedly the only seafood in it was shrimp. to me when a shrimp has a very strong fish smell that's bad news. i have a feeling it was a fish based stock and that's where the aroma came from. either way he really liked it.  fillet with fried potatoes(again didn't catch the name of this. sorry for the major fail): this was a grilled fillet sliced in a dark sauce with ""fried potatoes"" which in this case were french fry's. looked a little odd to me but my friend loved it.  ecuadorian tamale: so after reading the other reviews i decided to skip on the red and green as they seemed to be standard mexican tamales. could i be missing out? maybe but i was there for home field advantage cooking. so i got the ecuadorian tamale. this was cooked in a banana leaf. i was having a hard time getting the banana leaf flavor but the rest of my party assured me it was there. again.. stuffy nose :(  flan de coco: wow.. two of my favorite things in one, coconut and flan. this was pretty good. i can't say it was earth shattering but the coconut was not overly sweet. the ""syrup"" had a nice deep caramelized flavor. the flan had a nice texture. i have had better but it was nothing to complain about.  plantain torte: this was not what i expect and in a good way! they had mushed up the plantains into more of a pumpkin pie like texture. i believe it was also mixed with either a blueberry or blackberry as the color was slightly blue and it had a hint of one of those two berries. this was my favorite out the the two. it was the perfect sweet. the texture was very nice. it didn't give me that instant insulin shock affect from a sugar laden dessert.  i will be back! sadly i'm not sure when because i have many many other places to try but i'll get back there sometime. there were still a decent amount of things on the menu i would have liked to try out.  pros: super tasty food prepared by someones equivalent of your grandma. very friendly service.. think dinner at a aunt/uncles house. wide variety from many latin american areas.  cons: only thing i can come up with really is the wait. this is more of a personal thing. i really don't like to wait for a seat somewhere. i believe you should be able to make a reservation and be seated within 5 minutes of arrival. but considering this is a mom and pop place, the type of place i would rather see everywhere instead of these chains, i can learn to live with a wait :)  i feel its a tad on the pricey side for a mom and pop.",1

"surprisingly good, i didn't expect much for a sushi place at tempe marketplace (a huge outdoor shopping mall). well, i was wrong - the food and service here are astounding. the atmosphere is stylish and open and the price was fair. try the crab legs and the spicy tuna roll. great place to eat before watching a flick.",1
"i went to the street eats festival this past weekend with bestie and study buddy.  luckily we arrived late and didn't have to pay an entrance or parking fee.  the lines were unnecessarily long and didn't move efficiently.  so happy i didn't purchase the 2 for $10 deal i saw on the phoenix new times daily deals prior to the event.  my friends got ice cream from sweet republic that they enjoyed.  the highlight of the day was the french fries from superstition farm! omg!  they were delicious, especially with the chipotle aioli sauce!",0
"following up on the recent review by another yelper:  this is not a ""fast food sit-down"" experience.  food is cooked when you order, by a small but caring staff, and the dishes come out when they are ready.    nothing is going to sit for a while under a heat lamp until every dish for that table is ready.  it's more of a ""sit down and stay a while"" experience, especially if there are several groups in the place at the time.  so, adapt accordingly, and you will love the food here and the people who run the place just like all the other 5-star reviewers before you.",1
"the meat is not smoked just baked i think.  the brisket is very fatty any lacks taste , the chicken is tasteless.  the mac & cheese is on par with boxed with some jalapeños added, the corn bread was cold, the cole slaw was so so. the buns for the sandwiches are very good.  if you are in the area just go to joes bbq, much better and real smoked meats.",0
"great for a quick breakfast.  the croissants are quite large, and the bagels are fresh and chewy.  it took very little time for the food to be ready.  i would go back to try lunch at some point.",1
"pub crawl, stop 2: i have been to the library a couple of times and like it. what's not to like about college girls dressed in school girl outfits, sometimes live music and beer? the flyer stated it was offering $5 lemonade drinks and absolute raspberry. this was apparently news to the bartender, the waitress and the manager. good thing i had the flyer (which they then kept). the bartender said they had to do something to adjust the price in the computer and it would be just a minute. the absolute raspberry was actually a rather big shot and was tasty. i asked for a bud light while waiting for my change - the bartender suggested bud because it was $2. i took the bud. another guy ordered a bud light and the bartender again suggested bud. the guy asked how much bud light was and was told $3.50, where bud was $2. the guy decided to stick with bud light and was surprised to see his receipt...he said i thought they were $3.50? the bartender said ""they are $4 actually..."" the guy left pissed. meanwhile this whole event was about 20 minutes and i still don't have my change. finally i received change (after drinking the shot and half the beer). i left $1 and moved to the back of the bar where i ordered a second beer for $2.   while i like the library in general, the negative experience with the bartender including the confusion on the drink price, the long wait for change and the incorrect price for the guy beside me deflated my opinion of this bar a little.",0
"i went to hana expecting wonderful sushi. it wasn't.  there were some very enjoyable things about hana, and although it wouldn't be my first choice, i would go back if the choice was up to someone else.  the location is very convenient.  the place is small, and comfortable.  it looks inviting, and the employees are friendly.  they have a very interesting menu, but i had sushi only on this visit.  the sushi is served in a decorative wooden boat. everything was very fresh, but not what i hoped for...   the sushi was not bad, it just wasn't great.  it was a bit loosely rolled, and fell apart too easily.  they used fake crab instead of the real thing, but did not make that clear on their menu, and they did not have a couple of the things on their menu.  i was really looking forward to their  tamago.  they had not made any that  day.  the waitress who corrected my order and refunded the money i was charged for the tamago was not happy.  it didn't seem to bother her that an item on their regular menu was not available, and i had been charged.  what bothered her is that she had to correct the sale and give me back the overcharge.    it wasn't the best experience, but as i said, the food was very fresh, and except for that one waitress, the employees were very nice.  i will probably give the place another try, it just won't be for a while.",0
"love love love los dos. love the atmosphere, love the decor, love the crap on the walls, love the sign that says, please control your kids (and friends). love the food. love the shrimp entrees, love the veggie burro (enchilado style, of course - deep fried and drenched in cheese), love the margaritas that are bigger than my head and love love love the oh so soft and chewy sopapillas (with honey, of course).  the service, on the other hand, is a little more... complex.  one time when we were waiting for a table, when the guy called my name he called, ""last chance for mark d"". last chance? so we jumped up and ran inside just before he gave our table away to someone else. i said wtf? he said, i called your name three times (he did so not call my name three times - we were sitting right in front of the door the entire time - there's no way). so i told him that. and we argued about it, went back and forth like.. did too, did not, did too, did not), until i spotted the other guy - the nice guy - standing behind him shaking his head (they've kind of got this good cop / bad cop thing going over there), and the nice guy was just shaking his head, as if to say, ""ah, don't worry about him, he's just in a bad mood."" so we didn't, we sat down, ate some fabulous food, downed some rocking 'ritas and had a great time as always.   here's the thing i want you to take away from that story: even though it does seem like there's always at least one employee ""in a bad mood"", and the service may not be exactly friendly, it is attentive. i've never had to wait very long for anything, or not gotten what i wanted, i just maybe didn't get it with a smile. and for me, for this place, that's fine. that's just the way it is there. i think it helps knowing that going in. in my opinion, the food and atmosphere more than make up for it. hell, i keep going back and back and back and back...",1

"i had the privilege of attending this past friday for the phx art museums ""first friday"" event. this time is was a floral themed event.... where local floral artists were paired with different pieces throughout the museum.   it was really very wonderful! i had not been to the phoenix art museum for many years (since the monet exhibit). and i had the impression that this time it was much bigger than i ever remembered it.  i loved the diversity of the art exhibits. my personal favorites are the more modern multimedia type pieces.  there was a live performance art group when i was there... they were awesome... but very odd all at the same time.   i look forward to attending again next month. i would very mch like to make it a routine.",1
"it's been almost ten months since mike c. & i stopped in here for the weekday lunch buffet, so it seemed time to give the place an update.  back then, the buffet was so-so, & i gave it 3-stars.  this time, i purposely came to order from the regular menu, hoping to get them up to 4-stars.  as you see, it didn't work out.  you enter this place to a huge, stylish patio, that looks as if it should have little swap meet booths going along the sides, but it nothing was happening with them when i was there.  the inside of the restaurant is large too, with big comfortable booths along the side & large tables that you could scoot together for a big quinceañera or whatever out in the center.  you take your seat, & receive a generous bowl of good chips & a too little bowl of mild but tasty salsa to go along.  no problem, they'll bring me more salsa when it runs out.  (ok, so far, we're at 4-stars, but now things start going cuesta abajo pronto!)  *  first off, for my server i get señor unfriendly!    :-o  *  i had read the menu on their website before i came in, & knew that i wanted to order a chile relleno & taco combo for $7.99.  so far, as i write this review, it's still right here:   www.tradicionesrestaurant.com  then click menus, double-click the any of the menu pages, select print all pages, open menu.pdf & go to page 4.)  *  it was exactly 11 am, & the menu above said, ""served from 11 am to 3 pm daily"", as you see if it's still up, but they hand me a dinner only menu & try to charge me way more for the same thing!!    :-((  *  manager mr. canada confirms that i have been given a dinner only menu (in violation of his own written, published policy!), & that's what he wants me to have.  *  i refuse to pay the higher price, so mr. c tells them to give me the $7.99 price this time but that they need to ""fix"" the website right away!    :-o  *  in a little while, mr. unfriendly brings my plate, but it has a chicken taco on it, rather than the shredded beef taco that i ordered!    :-(  *  i don't want to make mr. u any worse than he already is (having just seen the movie ""machete""), so i don't say anything about receiving the wrong taco, but i do finally get up the nerve to ask him for some more salsa to replace the tiny bowl that he has already clearly seen empty.  why did i have to ask??  too many problems here, & it's especially not ok for a business to try & cheat me on the money!  one f-ing star!",0
"i went about trying that happy hour i mentioned a while back. the prices were happy for westgate, i suppose, but still about the same as many other sushi bars throughout the valley.  that awesome saketini i raved about last time? it no longer exists! i tried to fill that gap with the cucumber tokyo mojito and the lychee lime martini, but they just can't compare to my first love. don't get me wrong, i'll knock back plenty of those perfectly balanced mojitos. but the martini? i appreciate using lychee in drinks, but the bitterness of the shochu vodka makes it a drink i'll only enjoy because of the lychee pulp. at $5.50 each, don't think your hour will be happy if you and a buddy have too many.  the sesame chicken was good after the first few bites, but just too darn greasy for me. tough to finish. the rolls available are all below par, and that rose roll was disgusting! i know spicy tuna isn't the best sushi filling, but not only did it suck, the way it was just slathered on made me roll my eyes.  along with that mojito (i'm guilty of craving one), the nigiri is some of the better stuff i had. the albacore was neat and delicious--but at $3 a pop (okay...$2.95), i don't think it provides the push to boost this place into 3-star territory.  i'll inevitably be back with people that don't know any better, or just love westgate in general. and i'll keep checking in. don't let it go to your head!",0
"i have heard exciting and molto delicioso things defalco's. see, ever since i took a trip to tuscany a few years ago, i am always faced with yearning for the freshest prosciutto, the perfect cheese and bread, and a wine to wash down the salty, meaty goodness with. e ecco!   i ambled in and was awash in italian grocery goodness. the giant gallon-sized cans of extra virgin olive oil with the italia stamp on it made me long for the olive gardens of yesteryear, the truffled gelato in the freezer was whispering sweet nothings to me... i had to hold myself back fiercely to not grab a basket and start purchasing everything.   i stood in line patiently-- it was mid-afternoon on a saturday and there was quite a bit of traffic. while i waited, i stared in the refrigerated glass counter at the stuffed mozzarella balls, the various italian salads and fresh-cut meats. i moved closer and laid my eyes on the menu. there she was: ""il purista,"" the greatest-sounding sandwich ever: prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, tomato, roasted peppers, extra virgin olive oil, & balsamic vinegar. che fortunato! i ordered it from the surly italian guy behind the counter. the sandwich was the perfect combination of flavors, but what was most impressive was the pile of prosciutto on it. i could not believe the quantity, quality and savory goodness. my mouth waters just thinking about it.  however, due to the fact that i had to wander around their close quarters for about a half an hour before i got my food, i think i will call ahead next time. they do have a sign that warns you about their process taking longer than usual, so i consider myself warned and cannot wait to sink my teeth into their food again soon!",1

"the location and atmosphere are tops, service is fine, food is forgettable.  i can say this because i ate there about a month ago, and now that i'm getting around to doing the review i can hardly remember what we had - a rare thing from someone who can recite an excellent meal course by course for years afterwards.  we did started with quesadia, and the four os us all got different dishes, all of which i tasted and not of which were either outstanding or offensive.  the red wine selection is heavy on the highly fruity/jammy styles.  the location next to the light rail on central, and with the big outdoor patio can make a trip to maizie's worthwhile if you are looking for a place sit, talk and nosh, if nosh isn't your key focus.  my husband and and i went with some relatives we hadn't seen in ages, and it was a great place to sit and catch up for a few hours.  and despite the crowd's that evening the server was gracious about not hurrying us out of there.",0
"more convenient to central phoenix than lee lee. their seafood is better than lee lee's but i do not like the pre wrapped produce here. this forces you to buy set quantities, which are often more than i need. i also find the selection and quality  of produce here inferior to lee lee.  other than those two differences, i think the rest of the stores is comparable and that prices average out.  unfortunately for me, i'm usually looking for specific herbs and vegetables and find myself driving farther down into chandler.",1
"i've always been partial to harkins theaters because they have the best seats.  i used to say, ""you know what would be the best theater?  amc experience, with harkins seats..""  guess what.. amc westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that.  i love this place.  it's frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it.  not to mention an imax.  the experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable.  nothing really more to say that it's a theater.  i do like the new stubs card that they put out.  yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it, but it's only $12 a  year.  not bad for all the free stuff you get.  another cool thing about this theater is the location.  if you are going to grab dinner/lunch before hand, ther eis a ton of places to choose from.  nice work amc on making a great theater!!  ohhh big big big heads up.  be sure to see a movie before noon or ya get to pay nice big money.   that's probably the draw back.  i'll still give you 5 stars.",1
"while the beans are tasty as other reviewers have said (they use lard in them; mmm mmm!) and the portion sizes generous, i just can't recommend you eat here based on the fact i found out they fry their nachos, and probably by extension other things using the fryer, in hydrogenated oil. you can ""feel"" it on the nachos, as they have a waxy coating when cooled.  i know not everyone knows or perhaps cares about the deathly spectre of hydro-oils (most commonly referred to as trans fats), but believe me: they're highly dangerous.  it's a damn shame, too, as most of the offerings at this place seem solid and they even have three-person mariachi bands at the ready to serenade you. in my short time in phx, this looked like it was going to be the best mexican place i had found yet. oh well, back to the drawing board.",0
this is safeway's local 'urban footprint' store - a mere half acre under roof with a tiny 9/10 acre parking lot in front.   they even have a useless bicycle stand jammed up against their back fence - useless because you can't fit any size wheel base between the rack and the fence it's jammed up against.  they used to know how to design urban footprint stores - there's a building still used as a grocery store that started life 80 years ago as one of the first safeways - at 10th street and pierce - only 1 mile away.,0
"v-day 2013, destination: roma garden ristorante! here is the synopsis:  ~fud/drink~ fiance got the fettuccine alfredo with chicken and asparagus. it tasted well and had the flavors just right, the sauces were just a tad bland and oily. i got the linguini pescatore with mussels, shrimp and other fresh seafood mixed in a white wine sauce. i see a common theme with the flavors not being too exciting for other diners, which is a shame. traditional cooking does assume that the flavors aren't supposed to overwhelm the entirety of the dish. if the flavors to you are bland, then i might suggest a place that over-emphasizes sauces, like the olive garden. i do agree, the white wine sauce was a less flavorful as others in the past, but i hate tasting the butter in the sauce, its a big turn-off in a dish. you have to  consider you are paying for the seafood, not the sauce...by the way, the seafood tasted fresh as it could be, the mussels  were especially fresh and flavorful. the shrimp also had the flavor you would expect from an animal living in the sea. the seafood was executed flawlessly, thus improving the pasta dish exponentially. the linguini was also cooked perfectly. the wines we shared were paired perfectly for our dishes, and although expensive, really tied the flavors of our dishes together.  honestly, if you come here, get something that is special. if you get a simple marinara, spaghetti and meatball dish....just why bother? make it at home, lazy. come here to enjoy something that is difficult to execute...that's why you eat out at a nice establishment in the first place. i hate seeing people complain that they can make it at home...go home and let me try your outstanding dish, i can't wait to try it emeril! **that sounds just like something gordon ramsey would say, with a few ""stupid donkey's"" mixed in.**   ~atmosphere/service~ romantic...is what comes to mind, of course. its a nice little spot with a cute little room for service, the tables are done up nice. no music is piped in, its a relaxing and calm atmosphere. the bar room area up front is done just right, its not too large/small or pushes into the main room ruining the vibes. high tops are available to sit at as well as a bar to walk up to. our waitress jen knew all the specials and did not rush through them on a busy v-day night. instead she took time to go over all the options and the wine selection. she provided us the best service i have had in a while from a server. she consistently would come up at the perfect time to check in on us, and she was so personable and friendly. when i mentioned the 10% check in offer (which i was unaware of until i checked in), she immediately gave me the discount with a smile. she received a big tip, she deserved it for making our night even more special. also the busser was a gentleman, he quietly helped put grated cheese/pepper on our dishes and without us asking put our food in our to-go boxes. the service is excellent.  ~extras/rating~ on an excellent note, you get 10% off if you check in on yelp! yay! that 10% went right back to our awesome waitress, who got a good tip, haha. we also got a free amaretto in a glass at the end of the night, really great touch to a wonderful dinner! this is a 4.5 out of 5 in my book, but i will knock it down to 4 stars because of the semi-bland sauce...but its a solid restaurant, instantly my personal favorite family-owned italian spot. jen once again was amazing, see if you can get her as your server. i highly recommend this spot!!",1
"always friendly, always clean, always fresh, always quick, always delicious. i go here for lunch all the time.  especially when i crave the yummy pizza creations or the greek salad or even when i'm not sure where i want to go - i know i'll always find something i like. there are always a good choice of pizzas to get a slice from (meat and not-meat varieties) and plenty of choices for your own pie.  my favorites are the greek pizza, the napoli, and the one with eggplant and pine nuts.  yum!  the new appetizer with hummus and pita is also delicious!    i like that you can get the salad and a slice lunch combo, and upgrade to a specialty salad for just a dollar more.  for a while there, i was always getting the greek pizza and a greek salad.  one time, the guy at the register asked my name and when i told him he said, ""that's right, i remember now.  i knew you were the ""greek girl,"" but i couldn't remember your name.""  that's when i decided it was time to change up the order. =)  p.s. go on ""two for tuesday"" when you can get two pizzas for the price of one (not slices) or just one for half price!!",1
"this was very disappointing!  we came for breakfast right after they opened up for the morning on a sunday, and the entire place smelled like cheap cleaning supplies which really did not help my appetite.  the smell was almost overwhelming the whole time we were there.    the service was very good and fast, definitely above average service.  however, the food was mediocre to just bad and it was way overpriced for the quality.  i had a spinach enchilada with beans and rice.  the spinach enchilada tasted good, as things that are 1/2 sour cream can't help but do.  it was low quality, high calorie and not very subtle.    the rice was probably my biggest complaint.  while it had a pleasant orange color, it tasted like...  plain white rice that was a little too old.  sort of crunchy where it shouldn't be.  the tortillas, salsa and chips tasted like they came  from a grocery store.    so all this would have been just fine if it hadn't cost like $11 each for our breakfasts.  this being arizona, i have higher standards for mexican food and this was way too expensive.",0
"i am a bit surprised at how many people refer to ice house tavern as a ""dive"".  it is not a ""dive"" in the true or hipster sense.  a ""dive"" does not have 6 flat panel television sets, a disc jukebox stocked with local music & a modern internet connected jukebox, a mean pulled pork sandwich or a great selection of booze.  it may be old (by phoenix standards) but it's no ""dive"".  ice house tavern is one of the best bars i've been to.  period.  unique to boot.  it's attached to an ice rink.  while i was there a range from mites to juniors were practicing on the ice.  i was even treated to watching a phoenix roadrunners zamboni resurface the ice between sessions.  as the practices died down the bar began to fill with hockey people.  it was amazing.  i was able to watch a red wings game with sound at a bar in phoenix.    according to a calendar of events posted by the door there is also dart tournaments, local comedy and bands.  i think they get punk shows.  i found out, after the fact, that a few friends have attended shows there.    the beer selection was most impressive.  have your pick of cheap swill or tenderly crafted micro brews.  a delicious pulled pork sandwich is the only proper eats offered.  if pulled pork isn't your thing you'll have to settle for snacks: corn nuts, slim jim and various candies.  great service too.  ice house tavern is a must and i look forward to future visits and, perhaps, the opportunity to explore events that happen here.  i know i have found a home to watch hockey games.",1
"i ended up here on my birthday and the bartender made a stellar impression on the phone. we called around 6-7 on a saturday night and he said he would have a table waiting.  i was thrilled to come in, and it was a nice atmosphere. they do well with the space they have. i was a little sad by the menu because they vegetarian options were limited.  i ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo with mushrooms. typically i adore this dish, i can make it from scratch so i'm a bit picky about it. it came out with onions which was not on the menu. i despise onions with a passion. i had to wait for the waitress to come back so i could tell her, that was a good 5 minutes. when told she rushed off without a word, although i was still trying to ask her a question. it was really abrupt. she was generally nice most of the visit but i was still thrown off by the weird behavior. apparently it was not supposed to come with onions anyway. the other gripe i have is that the sauce seemed watery and runny instead of the thick creamy sauce alfredo typically would be. the wine was very good, but again with the waitress i attempted to ask her about the wines and she did not seem at all knowledgeable while she dodged my questions. i'm not sure if we would make a return visit. service and the confusing food issues just aren't up to par with surrounding places. my friends enjoyed their food though although were also baffled by our waitress.",0
"love this place!  we are there every sunday morning for breakfast.  everything is good.  huge portions.  big fan of the hopple popple and corned beef hash.  pancakes, oatmeal and omelets are great as well.  the staff and service are outstanding, a great place to go, relax and have the best breakfasts!   love to sit on the patio.",1
"keep on walking......  my friend and i each tried different dishes and shared.  he got nice roast and i got a hamburger.  the place is really nice....open, bright....  ..but the food is just a big disappointment.  a hamburger + 2 good beers was $37.   expect to pay a lot for your food here.  both dishes were poor.....  sorry, really wanted to like this one....",0
"went last night when we realized rice paper was closed for repairs. the service was prompt and fairly friendly. we got the pear and prosciutto (i think it was supposed to come with arugula but it had spinach on it - can't quite remember) and the potato with garlic. both were okay, nothing special or memorable. the proscuitto was suuuper salty and needed more sweetness to cut it. & the potato pies leaks were tough, also it just needed a little something more, not sure what. we both agreed we had better pizzas at other places in phoenix that had similar flavor profiles & would prefer to go there instead of here in the future.",0
"unfortunately as of late the service has really gone down hill. i still think the coffee is great, when you can get it. if they are busy then they seem to really get the joe out, but if they aren't things slow to a crawl.  not to mention they have messed up my order or my friend's order the last four times we have been there.  they apologize or say thanks for being patient although i never understand why we had to wait.  they seem to have enough staff maybe it's how they manage the preparation.  i had stopped ordering espresso drinks all together and just  get the cold brew since it comes out of the dispenser at the counter.  it's really a shame it used to be my favorite spot for coffee.",0
"sekai sushi keeps it simple, so i will do the same with my review: the place is clean everyone was friendly it wasn't crowded at all (sunday evening) the prices were average (for sushi) but the food was fantastic.  it's a little hard to find, pushed to the back of the shopping center (which also seems to be rather nice and clean) but if you're in the neighborhood, two people can eat very well for $40 after tip.  thumbs up",1
"this place was pretty good, kind of strange servers and my tots were burned, so it doesn't quite make the five star cut.  i had the bacon cheeseburger, with the pretzel bun and cheddar cheese-- it was super delicious and really a big burger so i saved half for an after-drinking snack.  my boyfriend had the macgnarly burger or whatever it is called, which is a double decker burger smothered in thousand island dressing, and he had it on a brioche bun, which was really good.  the fries were good.  the sweet potato tots would have been better if they weren't burned, and if they gave me some garlic aioli on the side instead of ketchup (sweet potatoes and ketchup? ummmm no)  i also had a spicy bloody mary and that thing was delicious!  parking can be gnarly around there, but if you park in the structure and take the super short hike to rehab burger, then you'll be fine.  enjoy!",1
"i finally made it to the top.  i live 10-15 min away and appreciate it from here, have referred other folks to check it out, but have never even driven up there until today.   so beautiful!  it only takes one or two turns to feel like you are in a whole new place. no more cookie cutter houses.  no more liquor stores.  no more walgreen's/cvs on every corner - though i'm sure they're working on it.    we drove straight to the top of the summit peak not too long before sunset.  it was originally our plan to stay for sunset, but with the crowd there on a saturday we decided to save that for a weeknight because we didn't want to deal with those tiny curving ""edge of the mountain"" roads with 50 other cars.    even if you aren't up for a hike, just driving up and walking around is really beautiful. listening to others conversations there were out of towners, university students and folks from about 5 to 85.  the view of the valley from there was really amazing.  it looks so small and yet so amazingly big all at the same time.  everyone who lives in phoenix should make the pilgrimage.  especially those who don't quite appreciate it yet. you'll never see another view quite like it.",1
"this was my first hike in phoenix, actually arizona for that matter. it was the perfect december afternoon, mid 70's; a far cry from the low 30's in washington! we found a parking spot, did a few stretches, and got going. it was fairly busy with hikers, but everyone was very polite/friendly if you needed to pass someone or while waiting to let a downward hiker by. the views were amazing and pictures from the top are worth framing. i was a hiking virgin, but i think this place was awesome! i think i'm ready to conquer camelback now!",1
"the pizzas are great. my husband loves, loves, loves the padre. the hamburger and salads are so delicious.  the parking can be a challenge. just be patient, go early or late and pray for a good spot. valet parking is a decent option. we have brought our 3 year old daughter there for dinner and she does okay for a toddler. we just promise her a gelato from next door. actually, we end up buying the gelato and she eats that while we eat dinner and box up her meal for later.",1
"this place just made my cool patio list - good in summer or winter the way it is set up!  very neato!  menu offerings were fresh and tasty sounding without getting obnoxiously trendy!  we had spinach salad lightly dressed with evoo, next time i would ask for a sprinkle of balsamic to add at the table but that's just me.  shared a margherita pizza, liked the crust a lot, nice chewy rind.  they have a small garden area outside, not sure if its for looks or if i just ate some of it - either way its a nice touch!  friendly service, no rushing us from the table, will definitely return and bring friends.  in fact, already booked two lunch dates in january!  happy new year to me, found a new locally owned restaurant!",1
been there a couple of evening and sat out on the patio area where the waitresses ignore you until you jump up and grab one even though she run ever table around yours. she wont even look at you when you wave at them. had to go to the inside bar to order drinks instead and me snd my friend got sick drinking the overly sugary daiquiri and long island. had to leave early after feeling sick but did finally wave down a waitress and get some chips.,0
"i love going here to play pool and having a couple of drinks. i have never had an issue and the drinks are really good. whenever i want to go out and have a good time, i suggest mill cue club. my fiance and i had our first date here and have been coming back every since.  i love going on sundays because it is only $4.00/hr all day to play pool. it is usually not that busy either. if it is, i still have not had to wait too long for a table. the drink specials are really good too. i kind of have an obsession with one of the pictures on the wall too. random i know but i always take the table that is next to that picture.  i do try to avoid it on friday and saturday nights though because it gets so packed that you can't move.",1
"went back to america's taco shop last night for my fourth time. i used to think it is over-rated and too expensive, and after last night, i'll just say that it truly isn't very good. $20 for dinner for two is reasonable enough, but the food is absolutely the blandest, most americanized, excuse for mexican i've ever eaten. i grew up in phoenix, in a hispanic neighborhood, eating mexican for almost every meal every day. this place is not the least bit authentic... it's just a gringo excuse for mexican food.  the patio out front looks like some amateur do-it-yourself'er made a trip to home depot and built a budget enclosure. seriously? you put plywood up in your parking lot... that's not really a way to make a proper patio. i can't believe the city allowed this debacle.   the kid who took our order on our last trip didn't know what was on the menu and repeatedly asked the woman there what was included in our meal. learn the menu before you go up front and start working... this is not his fault, it's poor training and management.   please boycot this restaurant so it can go away and the building can be used for something useful. there are a lot of great places up and down seventh street, but this piece of crap brings them all down to a lower level.",0
"i am not impressed with this place, my original review makes this clear. however, the fact that they were closed on the sunday of memorial day weekend makes them useless in my book. i was bringing two friends who had never been there, and still haven't because they were closed.  businesses up and down central ave were busy, especially hula's. they could have gotten the overflow from hula's but they were closed at 7:30 on a sunday night.",0
"still looking for that ever eluding mexican food joint with decent taste and prices. i was disappointed once again! there are no combination plates here, which makes it very expensive. i ordered a pork burro, refried beans and ice tea, total $12.00...hardly a bargain.   seating is mostly two person tables if you want ac, a lot of outdoor seating with a outdoor bar,all sandy floors which is not my cup of tea.  needless to say, i will not be back, bad seating and decor, over priced and not memorable food.",0
"i live right up the street, so after checking the reviews i decided to go to tom's thumb for breakfast on a saturday morning last month.  breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out.  it feels the most indulgent to me and i'm a coffee fanatic.  i'll take all you can drink java over soda every day of the week.  you go to the counter to order - i give the basic breakfast a try: two eggs anyway you want them, choice of sausage or bacon and home fries with choice of toast.  so, over-medium, bacon, sourdough.  and a coffee.  simple enough.  my total was $12, kinda pricy for eggs and bacon, but ok.  i got an order number to take to my table.  they have a dog friendly outdoor patio which my pup and i seated ourselves.  the restaurant is more self service than not.  to be expected in a gas station joint.  my plate came about 10 minutes later.  the eggs were over hard, the bacon was greasy and soggy and the home fries are a packaged frozen product.  the overall plate was lukewarm at best.  i didn't think you could screw up bacon and eggs, but this is not the dish to order.  they had a number of mexican breakfast specials on the menu, and maybe they are better.  i didn't want that much food.    bottom line - eclectic interior, easy ordering, great patio, kinda pricy, bad basic breakfast.  stick to the bbq; sounds delish.",0
the tacos were too greasy the pizza was on cardboard and the wings kicked my a**.  if you like really hot wings this is the place to go.  honestly they taste good too.  i have had lots of hot wings and love hot food but the extra hot at zipps is intense.  that would be the only reason i would so to go.,0
"chris s. personally attacked me for disliking cucina tagliani.  so, i would definitely listen to him when he asks you to consider the validity of these reviews.  it may be upsetting for chris to read such hatred in reviews, but it is more upsetting to get a message full of hateful personal attacks.  i hope chris isn't the owner, he seemed to be mighty emotional over the whole thing!  i'm not the only one who hated this place, chris.  are you going to attack us all?!",0
i hate that they charge 75 cents to use a credit card and that they charge extra to get a flour tortilla on a taco.  i have had much better tacos for less money!  i will not return.,0
"i had high hopes for tradiciones, so my husband i paid it a visit for lunch on a sunday, on our way to grab some groceries at ranch market. first off, after reading some other reviews, i was worried about getting a cold shoulder from the waitstaff -- but nothing could have been further from the truth. everyone was really nice and the service was great. the mariachi music was awesome, although i'm glad they didn't come over and try to convince us to get a serenade -- i hate that. it makes me uncomfortable...anyhow, the chips and salsa were top-notch. but the meals were just ok. my spinach and mushroom enchiladas had a good green sauce, and i was pleasantly surprised to see they weren't stuffed full of copious amounts of crappy cheddar cheese. instead they just had *some* white cheese, which was nice. my husband ordered some chicken dish that came with a stew (sorry, can't remember the name). he liked it. we each had a margarita, as i wanted to try the cilantro margarita, but i wasn't too impressed. granted, for $7, it really packed a punch, but the flavor wasn't too spectacular. overall, i'd say the atmosphere adds another star to what i would consider a 3-star meal. i'd definitely bring out-of-town guests here, as it's a fun place with decent mexican food in a town where (sorry, everyone) i find it very difficult to find decent, reasonable mexican cuisine.",1
"i feel like ray's is a little more pricey than other similar pizza joints, but i rarely care. g and i have a little joke about how long it will take for takeout ... no matter what time we call they tell me the pizza will be ready in 10-15 minutes - and they've never lied! it doesn't matter if it is the super bowl, friday night at 7 or sunday at 2, your pizza will be ready in 10-15 minutes. i think it is because they don't deliver. the pizza is huge, a bit greasy, and very tasty. it isn't quite new york pizza, but it is pretty darn close. this is a family run business - you can see dad, his daughters and maybe some other family members (cousins?) when you pick up ... i like that. and the girls and dad are sweet!  if they're not busy, dad can tell stories about the country he grew up in that would blow your mind. they're a sweet family living the american dream, and they make a tasty pizza. yay ray's!",1
"i don't know what i was expecting... i thought this would be a nice place for a nice breakfast... i was expecting frills... and boy was i disappoitned! my mom had breakfast there with a friend at the downtown location and loved it. so when we were on a shopping excursion to scottsdale this was the natural place to go for breakster.   we entered the crazy busy resturant that was all hustle and bustle... i was excited. we sat down and pour ourselves some water and ordered our food. we laughed at the silly egg-centric western themed paintings and waited for our food.   when it arrived it was a bit of a let down. the eggs benedict were mushy. i wish the english muffin was toasted more and the hollandaise was luke warm at best and became cold before i was done with my meal. it didn't help that the skillet they served it in was ice cold! i would have preferred it on a warm plate. the country potatos aren't anything great - but they aren't anything terrible eaither.  my mom loved her sun devils egg scramble with bell pepers and onions.   everything really reminded me of denny's and ihop. nothing was substantial, other than the rudeness of my fellow diners. one woman sat and picked at her teeth with her bare hands! mouth wide open and everything!! another man came in without shoes!! not even flip flops! wtf?! i thought this was scottsdale?! the hell?!  to my fellow yelpers: it's nothing great, save your money and your time and try somewhere else.",0
"i cannot believe i've not reviewed this place.  maybe it's because after eating their sloppy, over-cooked noodles and sugary fast-food combinations, i always feel a bit queasy.  kids seem to love it for some reason, and all the chinese places in the neighborhood are americanized versions of real chinese food. don't even get me started on that swill they call ""hot and sour soup""  it is neither hot nor sour and it's consistency is the only relation to soup.  pei wei is convenient and satisfies the kids, but i typically pass on it because it simply holds no appeal for me.  so, i guess in that respect, they fill a need for when you don't want to cook for your hungry teenager.    the other day, while feeding my kids there, one of the cooks got up on the wok table and started scrubbing the backsplash.  it's nice to see they like to be clean, but is it appropriate for that heavy cleaning to go on when you have customers in the dining room - and other cooks still cooking stuff?  okay, well, on second thought, i can believe i've not reviewed this place.  on a positive note, service is great.",0
"i've been to tammie coe a couple times as i live fairly close to this location. they have some pretty delish baked goods.... i've tried the crack cake (chocolate and mocha deliciousness), red velvet cupcake (cream cheesy frosting of wonderfullness... but hard to eat due to the top being larger than the base and all of the sprinkles), ooey gooey cupcake (ummm yum!), and the brownie (just ok...way too much frosting). overall, i don't think this is the most delicious dessert in town, but it is very good and i would (obviously) go back.",1
"brat haus, it's been a while but i remember clearly how amazing the staff was!!!  we got to this establishment, very close to closing time and we were still treated very well. i didn't get to eat much here, i just had a drink, a few french fries and about half of a beer brat with the hot peppers ( i gave the other half to my friend, guys will eat just about anything). that was all delicious, and even better with the special treatment as my small group and i enjoyed the fireplace in the back patio along with a fine game of jenga, we were practically the only one's left by that time.  it was all super swell!! :)  thanks again brat haus, i must come back some chill day to try out that pretzel with queso fundido!! sounds delish!! :)",1
"i fought against purchasing tickets to hawaii on us airways.  because they have also give me issues.  1 day before our trip to hawaii, us airways sends me an email to check in.  so i clicked on the button and found that my name is not on the any of the tickets anymore.  what????  wtf????  i called the #800.  10 mins into the auto menu, the system says they have overwhelming call and told me to call back later.  and hangs up!  what?  i need to be on the flight tomorrow.  called them back in 5 mins.  and i have been on hold for an agent for over 1 hour.  this is ridiculously!  after wasting over 1 hour of my life on hold, come to find out it is a system glitch.  really!",0

"so, not following my own advice (ahem, never return), i returned here for a friend's birthday dinner a few months ago (i super love this person so how could i say no?). ha! big mistake. also, fair warning: there are several-a-caps-lock ahead.  the only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people). and of course because we were celebrating a super special person.  i'll keep this update short and sweet:  $3 for a can of soda? get real. i knew it'd be overpriced but i was at least expecting a mini bottle or something. but a can? come on. you bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it. fail.  your servers: idiots. first it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders. then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again. did you forget? were you not paying attention the first time we around? why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks? and on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them. forty-five minutes to receive drinks is bad. very, very bad.   also, not taking food orders until after we've been seated for one hour is bad. very, very bad. seated at 8 o'clock, we didn't receive our food until almost ten o'clock. two hours for food is very, very bad. do you hear that, st. francis? bad.  because i loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner, and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil, i ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda). funny, that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us. excluding tip. bad.  also, server: if you say you're not going to split a check, stick to your word or don't even try. now, i'm glad you didn't stick to your stingy ""i don't split checks"", because i could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people i didn't know so well. lucky for us, when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check, you split it for us. a couple others caught on and did the same, but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky.   because i realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore (or sweet, for that matter), i'm ending it here. note to self: heed own advice and stay away from st. francis!",0
"the menu is pretty lameski if you don't go in for a lot of meat.  here's my problem with matt's: if you order the cheese omelet and have their paltry selection of veggies added to it, you're paying more than you would for a meat omelet.  that's pretty stupid; meat costs more than vegetables, and is a bigger deal to store and prep.  how hard is it to offer a reasonable vegetarian option?    i've eaten there twice for breakfast and lunch, and quality each time was middling.  the hashbrowns were not good, really slimy and squishy on the inside.    not worth the wait.",0
"i have always heard bad things about ra so i never wanted to make it a place to dine for sushi... i do think that most negative comments were referring to the location in scottsdale if that makes any difference.  so what brought me to ra was a team dinner with my coworkers.  the drinks i had were a little sweet than i usually like, but still good.  we were sat right away and the service was attentive... everything i had sushi wise was very good.  i enjoyed this much more than what i had at kobe japanese steakhouse & tepan & sushi.  i would agree with other reviewers that the music is really loud and kind of out of place for a sushi restaurant.  in fact when we first arrived the music was at a normal level and then at some point they really cranked it up so then you kind of had to shout at the people in your party.  other than that i really enjoyed the sushi and would come back for lunch since my office is close.",1

"i have now been to pita kitchen twice this week, i suppose that in itself says something.  checked out this place for the first time when i went with a friend of mine on tuesday, we went less than an hour before closing and still received very prompt and exceptionally courteous service....very awesome.    said friend and i both got the gyro pita, generous portion and very fresh pita, it was definitely tasty.  the meat was tender.  also inside the pita is tomatoes, onions, and taziki.  the onions could be a bit thinner in cut as it was mostly thick slices.  and the taziki which they are very generous with, is a little thinner than i am used to.   went again today with my mom, she loves spanakopita, so was excited to find it on the menu.  it is listed as an appetizer, so i figured it to be small, and it was, but for the price of less than $3 it was still a good deal.  again, i had the gyro and it was right on with tuesdays visit.  *note to self: order gyro with taziki on side next time, they are super generous with it!  i don't know how the rest of the sides are, but they are generous with the fry portion, making the combo a very filling meal.  the regular fries are fine, pretty typical shoestring.  the greek fries are not as addictive as they are at my big fat with their lemon sauce.  however, they are still tasty.  they come with extra seasoning, some oregano and feta crumbles.  sprinkle a little lemon on it and they are lovely.  what truly stands out at this place is the service.  these people are genuinely gracious and appreciative to the customers coming in their restaurant.  i don't know if it is just the first week excitement, or if this is how it will always be, but the welcoming demeanor of this place i have seen so far, on top of good food at good prices will definitely keep me coming back.  welcome to the area pita kitchen, and thank you for bringing something new to this neighborhood in desperate need of variety and choices!",1
"after a long day on the golf course with my father and brother we decided to give the grind a chance. we were craving a burger and shake and wanted to try out this 1000 degree coal burger experience. unfortunately we never got to the food.  we sat down at 6pm on a saturday with out any problems, there was only 1 other table seated and now i understand why it was so empty. i am not a fan of pretentious places like this really. we are given some weird little folded up paper menus (that were stained with sauce) that when opened up read like i am at a fancy steakhouse. it took me a few seconds to even figure out where the burgers were on there. after looking though 15 or so different burger concoctions i decide on a $12 bbq burger and realize that i now have to fork over $4 more for some fries. $16 for a burger fries? wow, it must be good!  we all request a shake but our waiter (skinny guy with black moustache and goatee) explains that they don't have vanilla ice cream. he left and got us some waters and then when he came back we point out that there is a fry's supermarket a few stores down and perhaps they could send one of the 5 other waiters that were sitting at the bar doing absolutely nothing to go get a $3 gallon of vanilla. he rudely explains that they have been going to fry's for many weeks when they run out and it's too expensive to keep doing it so they were just going to wait until monday comes along and their regular ice cream is delivered. wow. all three of us look at each other in disbelief. did he really just say that? we actually pressed him again about how easy it would be for them to send 1 person to go get ice cream from fry's so they could make us the shakes that are on their menu and he got even more rude and told us the exact same story again. so because of their inadequate ice cream ordering skills the customer is now banned from ordering a shake  that is on their menu?   is this guy telling me that rather than make at least $80-$90 off the three of us that going down to frys to spend $3 is going to cause financial problems for the grind? in a business where customer service is so important and it's extremely hard just to get people in the door i am shocked that this server didn't care in the least about making the customer happy. in fact as we voiced our opinion out loud to him and the rest of the staff they pretty much laughed at us and did absolutely nothing to try and repair the situation.   all of this because a lazy, smart ass, waiter didn't give two hoots about the business or the customers in it. i would rather go to wendy's and give them $12 for a baconator than ever have to deal with that crew of amateurs again. i give this place a few months max before it is gone.   go to 5 guys if you want a hamburger done right, they are adding milk shakes to their menu very soon as well which will make it perfection.  i will be sure to let everyone i know how sad this place is.",0
"another great sushi happy hour place!! =)  i came here with a friend last week to try out their happy hour. i'm not sure what i love more, happy hour, or sushi. so when you combine it? doesn't take much to make me happy. lol.   they have happy hour from 3-7. we ordered a lot! i think i always over order every time i go get sushi. which is horrible since i'm tiny and don't even eat much. lol. we ordered the philly roll, vegas roll, dragon roll, salmon nigiri, and so much more. i really liked everything. it was beyond fresh and very reasonably priced for happy hour. i also ordered their lychee martini  which was delicious while my friend got some sake. we ordered about 6-7 rolls plus 2 drinks and it only came out to about $40ish!   they also do the tepanyaki cooking here which reminded me of benihana. we got there at the perfect timing which was around 5:30ish because it got extremely busy. i thought the service was good and so was the food. i'll definitely be back to get my sushi happy hour fix on! =)",1

"i love chompies.  i really do.  just stay far far away from this place on sunday morning / afternoon.  the place is incredibly understaffed.  table for 3 with a baby.  told us it would take 15 minutes to sit.  it took more like 30.  we sit down.  we wait 5 minutes, no waitress.  a table next to us get's seated.  they get greeted, get their drinks then get their food order taken.  then the same waitress comes over and takes our order.  so now we've waited 30 minutes to be sat and 15 minutes to have a waitress come to our table.  i ask for 1 scrambled egg to come for the baby as soon as it's ready.  10 minutes later a manager comes to the table with our egg.  it's undercooked and cold.  very mushy.  you would think being the manager, he's qualified to take a look at a scrambled egg and know this is undercooked.  it was quite obvious.  i send it back.  20 minutes later our food comes out.  still no egg.  i ask the food runner.  she comes back with an egg that cooked fine but freezing cold on a very hot plate (a very tell sign that these eggs have been sitting under a heat lamp for 15 minutes)  if the egg was for me, i would have sent it back.  but it's for a baby and i would have cooled it down before i fed him.    the food was great but never saw our waitress again after she took our food order.  if we wanted water or extra napkins, i got up and got it myself.    this isn't my first rodeo.  my wife had her baby shower here on a sunday and we got the same crappy service.  i need to remind myself to stop coming here on sundays.",0

"meh.  we come here every year for our brides of march pub crawl.  in general, it's a nice bar with a great patio and a fun cocktail menu.  this year, they screwed the pooch.  they were supposed to have food available and did not.  my friend was purchasing drinks for the table.  unsure of what i wanted, i flipped through the handy dandy cocktail list.  there was a page for grey goose cocktails, one of which was a grey goose orange.  it sounded yummy so i asked her to get me that.  the bartender apparently had no idea what it was so i got greg goose and orange juice.    if you're going to push top shelf liquors with ads on the tables, maybe you should have a look at the drink suggestions.  i also wonder if they had a run on glasses because there was a guy hovering over our table just waiting to whisk our glasses away.  buzz off, dude.  my vodka/orange juice flavored ice cubes were tastier than my actual drink.",0
"2.5 stars. i think i was most turned off by the crappy service at rogue on a recent saturday night for william f reed's shake dance night.  whether they were understaffed or what, i don't know.  but the wait for a drink at the dark dank bar was at least 20 minutes.   i spied mike's pitcher from a few minutes earlier and thought that would be a better deal since it took so freaking long to even get the attention of the bartender.  the bartender chick snapped at me and screamed ""no more pitchers!"" when she had just served one a few minutes earlier, so i had to settle for carrying around a bunch of pbr cans like an effing high schooler.  shoot, if i knew i would be lugging beers in my pockets i would have made alternate plans.  i'm not above bringin a flask.   the crowd is kind of all over the place, like glam and homme, except here it skews more indie punk rock or wannabe indie punk rock. i love me some divey bar, so i was looking forward to a decent time at rogue.  that bar experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  cheap ass drinks couldn't make up for it. i might be back, but i'm in no hurry.  the bar itself is dark and dirty (bathrooms vie for the sickest in town, parking lot vies for smallest in town), and i'm ok with that, but with the crappy bar service, what would the saving grace be?  the people and the music.  seeing a dozen or so friends (including bonnie and michael) randomly converge on this place after a concert rocked in my book.  and top that with everyone screaming and dancing to ""your love"" by outfield.  and that's worth at least two stars right there.",0
"i went here for breakfast the other day and it was very good! i was on the fence about going here, but decided to give it a shot, which turned out well. the place was pretty empty, but it was a weekday, so that is to be expected. our waitress who may or may not have been the owner (she was french), was attentive. the bf and i shared a chocolate croissant and it was delicious! i like how it was sweet but in a subtle way. i had the egg sandwich, and, unfortunately, they were out of butter croissants, so i had the sandwich on french bread. the bread was good, but i can only imagine how good the croissant would be. the sandwich came with a small salad that had the most flavorful balsamic dressing....so good and also came with very crispy, almost like shoestring fries, hashbrowns. all was wonderful. the bf had the nutella crepe and it was light and fluffy with, again, a subtle sweetness. i need to try this place again before i can give them a 5 star....but it really was yum to the extreme....  ps i really want to try their lunch (the sandwiches look great) and their desserts (i think i got fat looking at their display case...but so worth it)",1
"i was really happy to find a 24-hour mexican joint nearby.  the service was friendly, the ladies there really nice, the food tasted like just about all the other mexican places nearby (whateveriberto's, el favorito, rivas'), but was really good and filling.  why two stars?  well, it started with my  wife getting up in the wee hours afterwards having to spend a considerable about of time on the loo--it was the food she ate at amado's--right through her, and quite painfully.  i wasn't happy about this, and was even more upset when i began to purge myself--from the other end. . .  i know this is tmi, but i can't sufficiently express the agony involved in vomiting up anything containing chili powder.  oh my god. . .  it really is too bad.  i would have really liked to come here again.  the food was delicious. . .the first time around only.  unfortunately, we are going to avoid amado's in the future.",0
"fantastic food! i had the turkey and brie sandwich, omg seriously, so good. i just wanted more. the good news' the potato salad the sandwich came with, was equally fantastic. i left full and happy. i will be going back for this sandwich!! they lost a start because of service (one of the waitress' friends was at a table, and she kept just sitting and talking to her, meanwhile we had empty water glasses on a hot day), and also, prices are kinda high. mostly a great experience here, we will be back.",1

"my girl vanessa & i were in the mood for sushi saturday night & we decided that roka akor was going to be our destination!   i loved the modern look of everything about this place, from the dim lighting to the stylish furnishings. i can't believe we never checked out the bathrooms though, 2 girls sipping drinks & no restroom trip? boo us!   we opted to sit at the bar & took 2 seats facing the restaurant. i started off with a kirin light ($5 for a 12 oz bottle) & v got a glass of white wine. off of the izakaya (aka happy hour) menu we ordered: the kobe beef & kimchi dumplings (3 pieces for $5), their signature hamachi serrano chili roll (6 pieces for $5), their signature butterfish tataki (3 pieces for $5) & the cremini mushroom with soy garlic butter skewer (3 pieces for $2). loved them all except the roll, i guess we are wimps because we thought it was too hot. i hate doing so but v sent it back, they were cool about it & didn't charge us for it. disappointed with our sushi (the main reason for going out!), we decided to try a couple other rolls off of the regular menu. we ordered the spicy tuna & their signature soft shell crab rolls. the tuna was delicious but we've both had better else where. i thought the soft shell was ok but v hated it, the warm crab just rubbed her the wrong way i guess. she wanted to return that roll as well but i stopped her, i felt bad! still feeling hungry, (we must sound like major fatties w/all the food we ordered but i swear, small portions!) we couldn't resist & ordered the prime beef filet w/chili ginger sauce (medium rare). oh em gee!!! this was definitely the favorite of the night, it was so tender it melted in our mouths! the sauce was tasty as well. oh & we also shared their signature blood orange margarita, one of the best cocktails i've had in a while!   with all that food & drink our total came to about $100 (including tip), not bad at all for the location & quality of food. so our dinner didn't go exactly as planned but we had a great time & would definitely come back again, just not for the sushi!",1
"i've been coming to inta juice for at least two years now.  any time i feel under the weather, i zip right over for a shot of wheat grass.  i usually can't resist a large juice to go as well.  the service is friendly and informative when you have questions.  i never feel pressured or annoyed.  the prices are reasonable, and the quality is top-notch.  everything is prepared fresh in front of you from actual fruits and vegetables (and wheat grass!).  awesomeness!  the drinks are tasty too!  today i crawled in to the store in my pajamas and told the owner that i was ""dying"" from the heinous head-cold and rattling cough that have been ruining my life this past week.  he quickly suggested the amazon cherry, which contains a super serving of vitamin c.  i also added bee pollen and high-c supplement to my juice to ensure i am getting every natural healing element that inta-juice could offer me.  right now, i'm feeling refreshed.  tomorrow, i betcha i'll be feeling a little bit better.  :)",1
"i have entered the 7th level of hell, and it is zuma grill.  let me set the mood. it's friday night, i am out with some ""gym buddies"" we don't hang out often, one is like me, low key, chill prefers places like casey moore's, the other likes the clubs.   as we hang at casey moore's a debate begins of what we should do next,  club dude, wants to walk down mill and hit up some of the more club like places, with dance music, girls scantly clad, etc etc.  my other friend and i decide after a few hours of whining, that we should just head out and let our  club dude, do his thang. we reluctantly leave casey's, as i as good bye to my ""regular"" buddies, and head down mill.   after trying a few places, (library, sky bar or something) we settle on zuma. i immedately feel akward here, and realize how lame mill ave is between rula bula and casey's. i felt like i had waked into the movie idiocracy as i witness disturbing behavior and conversations about absolutely nothing.  coming from the art diverse,and somewhat intelligent low key crowd of casey's into this, was quite the decline into oblivion.    we ordered drinks, and drank...drank....drank. it was getting late so club dude, hit the pseudo dance floor that developed in the middle of the bar, and my laid back friend and i went out to the front ""patio"" so he could smoke. we continued our conversation about stanley kubrick while club dude, did his thang.   it was cool compromising, something i have learned to do better as i mature.  we all were able to be in our own environments for a period.  sometimes when you go out with new people, you don't know what you are going to get, but in this case we ended up having a decent time.   i don't recommend zuma for much, high priced drinks, really annoying atmosphere, and drunk people just falling out of the place, like lemmings on vodka.  however if that is your thing, than go for it. don't say i didn't warn you.  classy moment of the evening: walking by a table with 2 plastic fake glass buckets of ice, 2 bottles of moet's imitation champagne turned upside down,  now if that doesn't say enough, i am not sure what will about zuma.",0
"p. croissants has the smell of a few cafes that i have been to in france.  i got a turkey avocado croissant and a to-go black cherry chocolate one.  the lunch one was a perfect size and the flaky and crisp texture of the croissant was excellent.  the sweet croissant was pretty good too.  it wasn't too rich or sweet as i may have anticipated, which is perfect.  there are not very many lunch spots in the nearby 2 miles radius, and you can count on coming here for great quality food.",1

"this review is from their drive thru menu. be careful to really look closely at this chaotic display of a menu, you may think that something is one price and its actually another.  the items and prices are so close together in and in different sizing it looks like they just slapped updates up there and hoped everyone would figure it out.  i figured out i had made a mistake when i ended up at the window paying 5 bucks for a taro boba....with whipped cream that i wasn't given an option to decline (i hate whipped cream on drinks.) when i was completely caught off guard by the receipt handed to me, because the attended didn't let me know the cost before charging me and i stupidly had not realized that i hadn't followed their menu since everything was close enough to be mistaken for another price or item on there. i spoke up and asked about it, the attendant was rude about it. the boba was cooked well, however not enough of a pull for me to pay more and have to deal with rude service/chaotic menu. eh. another for the dnr list.",0

"really people?  maybe the meat dishes here are good. that's the only way i can understand why this place has such a large customer base.  initially, i was excited to see a vegetarian section on their menu with about 6 items on it.  we got one dish with tofu & vegetables, and another dish with vermicelli and fake pork.  the tofu dish tasted like it was cooked in fish sauce, and aside from it not being truly ""vegetarian,"" the tofu was awful and the wheat gluten meat is something you can buy in a can.  the other noodle dish was so bland that we had to add four different sauces to it, just to give it some kind of flavor.   i will give them props for being cheap...but we definitely will not be returning here.   oh, and their parking lot reeked of trash-juice-smell.",0
"wah sun is one of my favorite places to stop for fast fresh  inexpensive chinese food.  it is located in what was once a neighborhood with a good sized asian population, and while one or two of the most popular places in the neighborhood have either disappeared or gone badly downhill, wahsun thrives.  nothing at this restraunt is overprocessed or pre-readied.  even the eggrolls have larger chunks and are made ready to cook when ordered.    the food is cooked in a very hot wok, giving it a delightful seared flavor.  like many ""old school"" chinese places, they have a regular menu, and a menu that is more geared toward diners who read something other than english.  my favorite is their third menu.  leave it in the hands of the chef.... i prefer their stirfry flounder with bok choy instead of celery, so it is made that way for me.  i like scallops with snow peas in a ginger sauce instead of garlic, and they are happy to prepare that.  when i walked in one day, rose told me i had to try the crab because they were fresh that day.  i did.  i'm not sure how it was prepared, but i am certain it was not on the menu....  it was wonderful.  another time, i was greeted by rose with the words you like cauliflowers? because today i make cauliflowers for you.""  i have learned that no matter what it is, i should say yes.",1

"the fact that networks had four stars a few days ago and now only averages three demonstrates the potential impact of not treating your customers well, especially when six out of eight of them just happen to be yelpers who are not afraid to write about their bad experience.   i was part of the group of 8 that stopped by networks during last saturday's pub crawl (which was featuring drink specials and food samples from downtown businesses). this event was clearly planned in order to generate more business for these local spots, which makes the manager's refusal to give us $1 beer and wine or any sort of meaningful concession (when the downtown pub crawl materials said ""$1 beer, $1 signature wines"" with no ""off"" anywhere in sight) that much worse.   you are certainly free to check this place out for yourself and maybe these four one-star reviews won't do anything to change networks' core crowd of patrons, but i can guarantee you that networks lost the approval (and referral) of five very grumpy yelpers!  p.s. congealed, cold pizza cut into miniature slices doesn't count as a ""food sample.""",0
"i went to roka akor last night for a belated birthday celebration (mine) with my bosses. it was during yelp eats week which meant when we arrived with no reservation we were told our only option was to eat at the sushi bar. fine with me!   the first thing we all noticed was that we had no server established until about an hour into our meal. four people randomly attended to us until our appetizers showed up and then charles came over and said he would be our server.  also, two of us had arrived first, and one of the first people to approach us was a woman with two towels to wash our hands. except they weren't warm. i have never ever had a cold wet towel handed to me in a japanese restaurant, and kat said every other time she's been here they've been warm. when kate arrived a few minutes later, no one offered her a towel at all. rad.   we waited for about 15 minutes before anyone asked us about drinks, and then we didn't know who to grab to ask about appetizers. we did finally get the opportunity to order the butterfish appetizer, and when kate asked for the seafood and vegetable tempura, she specifically asked if only one shrimp came with the order could they please add 2 more. the server seemed very confused and said he would have to ask the chef. come on this isn't brain surgery people, add 2 shrimp, jesus.    one of my bosses ordered a beef dish for her main course which she enjoyed except that they left significant chunks of gristle on the meat. the other ordered the miso cod which was completely perfect and something i would specifically seek out if and when i return to roka. i ordered the 3 sashimi chef's selection and for $17 dollars i was presented with a huge bowl of ice and approximately one ounce of fish, 2 slices of scallop, 2 slices of the 'cheap' tuna, and 2 slices of salmon. the scallop was fine, the tuna was a bit spongy but the salmon was gorgeous.  kate had also ordered a mushroom rice pot which didn't make it to our table for an additional 25 minutes. and for some reason, they didn't leave the pot at the table for us, which kate said they normally do, as the pot serves 6 to 8 people, and we'd only had one small plate of it each. i was in the restroom for the delivery and plating of the rice so i didn't even see the size of it.  but i think it's extremely rude to pull a half-full dish without asking.   charles brought me a scoop of strawberry passionfruit sorbet with a candle in it which was very thoughtful but i wasn't wild about it and ordered the orange flourless cake with rose petal cream and raspberries for dessert. that was very good, probably the highlight of the evening.  kate had ordered a nectarine shochu ($14) that arrived in a 6oz tumbler with a 4oz rock of ice in it and only 2 ounces of actual shochu. she was extremely disappointed with the shochu flavor which was not nectarine at all, more of a grapefruit gasoline. we called charles back and showed him the ice to shochu ratio discrepancy and he kindly removed it from the table and our bill.   both bosses have been to roka a number of times and said this was not a typical experience for the restaurant. and this was a wednesday! that makes me believe roka think it's cool to offer up sub-par service during promotional menus, even to those not interested in the promo. i would go back for the butterfish and the cod if someone insisted, but i can get a better quality and value for sushi at yen over on 43rd ave.  the evening was at least saved with great company and conversation.",0
"wacky sandwich! damn, i love me some wacky sandwich.   backstory: someone left a lee's sandwiches menu on the kitchen counter. it could have been me; i'm really not sure. but i spotted it while making coffee, then spent the next four hours lusting after a ham, head cheese and pate bahn mi.   yes. ham, head cheese and pate. fuck you. it's delicious.  but it's also in chandler. i think. gilbert? edge of mesa? i don't really know, but what i do know is that the corner of dobson and warner requires that i cross both the 101 and the 60. both of them. in one trip. i was tired just thinking about it.   instead: arai pastry. japanese sandwiches. not the same as bahn mi, no, no at all. but it was euro-asian goodness, and that's what mattered.  spicy teriyaki chicken topped with a slice of american cheese (wha?), spicy mayo (not ""chili aoili,"" mind you -- arai is not that kind of place), jalapenos, lettuce and tomato. on a nice big wheat baguette.   spicy. random. delicious. and thanks to good ole american ethnocentrism, my stomach is more than happy to lump all asian sandwiches together under the same umbrella. hunger solved.   thanks, wacky sandwich!",1

"came here for pizza and wings last night and the quality was way off. :(    the pizza wasn't nearly as cheesy as normal and all the cheese wasn't even 100% melted, the crust seemed different that usual too.  less doughy and fluffy and chewy and more like a thin, flavorless, store bought, pre formed crust.  (and i'm sorry, but if you run a special for a $6 12"" pepperoni pizza and the customer asks for just cheese, why not drop the price a tiny smidge, considering that you aren't having to provide any pepperoni on their pizza?  almost $23 for a small pizza, two dozen wings and one large pepsi is kinda high.)  the wings also weren't up to par this visit.  they were badly overcooked, so much so that the drumsticks had all pulled away from the bone and shriveled into little balls of overcooked cooked chicken at the end of the drumstick.  (i can't think of any other way to describe it...)  i like my wings well cooked (like chicken jerky) but last night's wings were just ridiculously overcooked.  they were also woefully skimpy on the sauce, and too boot the butter that makes up the base for my beloved long wong's mild wing sauce was kinda off too.  it tasted a tad rancid.  not enough to make me not eat the wings, but still i could tell it wasn't very fresh like it normally tastes.  it made me pretty sad.  adding to all that the damn pepsi wasn't as rich and syrupy and delicious as normal.  this time i could clearly taste the carbonated liquid underneath the pepsi syrup, and the carbonation was the dominant flavor.  they obviously changed the ratio at the fountain drink dispenser.  (wtf??)  overall this visit was extremely disappointing.  extremely.  i am a huge long wong's fan, and i live right down the street so i tend to come here a lot, but after last night's visit i am not sure when or if i'll be back...  long wong's management, heed my words.  if a die-hard regular like me is contemplating finding another wing place, you need to take a good, hard look at what you've changed and change it back.  whatever penny pinching you did with the pizzas was no bueno.  also, the stinginess on the wing sauce and the pepsi mixture was not a good move either.  those were the things that we loved about your restaurant, and would come and brave the less-than-sparkling-clean conditions at your establishment to enjoy.  if you kill the food quality by skimping on cheese, using some crappy pizza crust, being stingy with wing sauce (on wings!  the very thing you are known for!!  do not tamper with a fan favorite!) and the syrup mixture on the fountain dispenser then there is almost no way i am braving that frenetic, overcluttered, hot ass mess of dining room restaurant to come back.  normally i can ignore all that junk on the walls while i savor the delicious food, but now that the food isn't distracting me, i can hardly ignore the random junk dangling from the walls and ceiling.  i am willing to bet you that others will agree here.  you may have saved a little on the ingredients that you just cheaped out on, but it'll cost you a ton in lost repeat business over time.  penny wise, pound foolish.  please change it back!",0

"whether you are going for live music and brunch on the weekends, a drink with friends or an enjoyable dinner out, st. francis has a little bit for everyone.    my indoctrination to st. francis started with happy hour and drinks with a few friends early last year.  since then, this place has become one of my favorite spots for a night out.  there are a few other places that are on my coveted list of restaurants... it is not an easy list to get onto and requires that the following criteria be met:  amazing food tremendous service clean and inviting atmosphere  st. francis is on the list of places that never fail to meet this simple, but important list.  last thursday we were in for dinner.  my wife had just arrived home from a business trip and we wanted to go out for dinner and we wanted something we knew was going to be great.  we ordered the veggie flat bread for an appetizer, french onion burgers and we even did cheesecake in a jar for dessert (which is rare anywhere... dessert that is).  the veggie flat bread is soooo good, the flavors are just incredible and they derive from the natural flavor of the veggies.   so the main course came and we realized the bread was a little stale, strange, but not a big deal... we let our server know and she immediately took action to correct the issue.  we were pretty calm about the situation, we had never had a problem at st francis before.  as it turns out, they purchased a new bread rack and it was close to the oven, unfortunately as we found out, the oven was also drying out the bread on the rack.  our server said she informed the executive chef who was said to have started looking at the bread and realized that the oven was doing a real number on the bread.  she said that the chef was taking corrective action and was sorry for the issue.  not a problem for us, we were happy that they were taking care of our order and making sure it did not happen again.    i have had bad experiences before, the difference between those experiences and my experience at st francis is worlds apart because the staff reacted immediately, they seem to care about what they do and the food that they serve.  anyone can tell me they are very sorry, but between saying the words and fixing the problem are real actions; notification of an issue, understanding what caused the issue, reviewing food that has not been sent out of the kitchen, addressing the concerned customer and checking to see if other customers were affected by sending the servers out to see if everything tasted ok.  not just words... actions.    go to this wonderful restaurant, embrace the relaxed atmosphere and enjoy their food.",1
"it started two weeks ago when i purchased my ticket from their window.  i was charged $2.50 for a service fee.  what service was provided?  all i received was a ticket and it wasn't a real ticket.  it was simply a standard receipt.  when i go grocery shopping or go to any store i get the same thing without being charged a ""service fee"".  at the club i was treated to a two drink minimum.  i ended up with two bottles of blue moon for $12.  that's not a typo.  you read that correctly.  $12 for two bottles of blue moon.  a guy sitting across the table from me said he didn't drink alcohol and was offered a bottomless coke for $13.  the server was obnoxious, took too long to bring out my drinks and irritated myself and the folks sitting around me.  during the act the server came around trying to sell shots on special.  why were we interrupted during the show?  a 15% gratuity was added automatically to my bill.  this does not sit well with me as i do not believe in standard mandatory tipping.  a tip is for good service and should not be included automatically on the bill.  besides, with good service i would have left a larger tip than what was added.   i could have lived with this and let it go but the waiter also asked each party if they would round up to 20% and leave a few extra bucks.  this was over the line and out of bounds as far as i am concerned.  the show itself was great and my review is not a reflection on the talent that performs at stand up live.  i do not enjoy, however, getting overcharged on beer and paying fees for imaginary services.",0

"i agree with some of the gripes written by other yelpers. we went to see bob saget last night and it was our first time visiting stand up live.  the website mentions that parking is free for the first three hours with validation, and $2/hr after that....but doesn't really elaborate where. we had to make a second loop around the block to find the ""hidden"" parking garage entrance on 1st ave. problem is this is very limited parking. we made three loops inside looking for spaces. tip: bring your small car!! spaces are tiny! once inside my husband and i were seated in the middle row shoulder to shoulder with other couples, which wasn't so bad as we were next to nice people, but it makes it difficult to get out. our server was back and forth to the table often, but we did have one drink error which she promptly fixed, and our food went to another table by mistake. so we waited an hour to eat. the comedy was good, acoustics, bathrooms, all good so no complaints there. good opening act for bob saget.  our bill was $54 for one veggie burger, two san tan ales, and two vodka rocks. oh, and if you order vodka on the rocks your bill will say $8 for the vodka, and $2 for the rocks. no kidding. we even asked our server about it. they in fact charged us extra for the ice in my drink.  no customer finds these unnecessary and frivolous charges fair. it left me with a very negative feeling at the end of the evening.",0
"now i've been to tia rosa several times and i've always enjoyed the food and margaritas.  i specifically love the grilled peppers and onions you receive with some dishes.  that said, last time i was there, i ordered a vegetarian burro ($12....which is already quite a lot for a burro filled with beans), and asked to have some grilled peppers and onions put inside, instead of cheese....and then the grilled peppers and onions on the side instead of the beans and rice.  my burro ended up costing $18!  $3 extra for each addition of the grilled veggies.  i could have got a better tasting burrito at chipotle...actually 3 veggie burritos at chipotle for $18...and those come with peppers and onions, and guacamole!  when you spend $60 on margaritas, and another $80 on food,  i would expect them to throw in a side of vegetables.",0
"i was browsing yelp and saw all the bad reviews of aunt chiladas. i laughed because of all my bad experiences there myself.   every time i have gone there for food i have had a horrible experience. they have very limited choices for vegetarians. now, i understand mexican food is not vegetarian friendly. i am half mexican myself. i know refried beans and tamales are traditionally made with lard and sauces and rice often have stock in them. i am usually able to ignore it if i can't taste it. or a server will be able to offer me vegetarian options.   every time i have gone there and ordered the vegetable burrito or cheese enchilada combo, the beans tasted horrible. the last time i ordered food there, i was with a very big group of family and friends. i ordered the bean and cheese nachos. the beans tasted and horrible and i asked the server what was in the beans. he said there was bacon in it. i told him i was a vegetarian and ordered the cheese quesadilla. he informed me that there was lard in the tortilla. i told him i would stick to the chips and salsa. he told me there was lard in the chips. i asked him if there was anything without lard and he yelled at me (in front of the whole restaurant) that everything had lard in it. i sarcastically asked him if my margarita had lard in it. he smiled and said no.   to be fair, i have gone there just for drinks in the bar a few times and had a good time. the bartenders were always nice and they had good bands playing.   so imagine my horror when i found out my high school reunion was going to be at aunt chiladas. my $40 ticket included a buffet full of lard. at least 2 drink tickets were included. but i wasn't going to let a bad restaurant ruin my night of reuniting with my high school chums. so i had a good meal beforehand and hung out around the bar all night. the bar staff was great and i had a wonderful time. :)",0
"i was so excited to see a potbelly sandwich shop was opening up in phoenix.  i had grabbed a delicious sandwich from potbelly many times while on the east coast and always loved their simple but great approach to sandwiches.  i had the ham and cheddar on multi-grain bread with mustard, tomatoes, pickles and hot peppers...it was so good!  the hot peppers sure do have a kick and really complimented the sandwich!  i recommend adding the hot peppers to any sandwich, only if you can take the heat!  if you really like the hot peppers, you can purchase your own jar for $6.95! it was their 2nd day open so some of the workers were still getting use to the feel of the place but you really cant fault them for that!  this will be a place i return!  thank you potbelly for coming to the valley of the sun!",1
"the food here is top notch, don't know where to find better chicken and waffles. i keep coming back, but there's something wrong when i have bad service over half the time.  i don't know what the deal is, but on more than one occasion we've had unpleasant waiters/waitresses. i don't ask for much at restaurants, but reflling water or asking for a couple more minutes to look at the menu should not warrant a skank face. maybe the serving staff had a bad day... multiple times... during the same week...  eh, who knows. i guess that makes it a ""legitimate"" southern experience, but regions don't excuse poor service. i suggest going for the classic combo, but don't be surprised if things go south from there...",0
"i didn't know what to expect walking in here. the misspelled name should have been a sign. the place was small and pretty full. the food was pretty good overall, except for over seasoned french fries.  my biggest dislikes were the attire and professionalism of the employees. seemed a bit inexperienced and undressed for people i want handling my food. the menu was confusing and poorly laid out.  the place had a 50's dinner feel, certainly not a ritzy upper class feel, so charging for sides separate from your burger seemed way over expensive. maybe if the place looked nicer and the staff dressed nicer i wouldn't mind paying so much. you can choose coleslaw or side salad. the coleslaw comes in a tiny little dressing cup vs. the side salad on a nice size plate. thankfully i ordered the side salad, but if i hadn't i'd complain about those serving proportions.   the place seems good for kids as they were running about.",0
"my wife and i enjoyed the 12 inch sausage and grilled vegetable pizza (grilled vegetables is definitely out of my comfort zone). the pizza tasted great, we spent $18 on this medium pizza, a little bit pricy in my opinion. they do have creative pizza selections, and cater to the wine drinkers as evident by their large wine selection and display of wine bottles in the dinning room.   i would describe the parlor as an upscale grownup retreat with a sophisticated vibe (i wouldn't bring small children here) but parking must be challenging on the weekend. the parking lot was packed on a tuesday night when i dinned there.",1
"after driving cross-country to get here, it was time for maximus to get an oil change. i looked on yelp for somewhere to go and like everyone else, was impressed with their great reviews. i was unable to go but my mom took my car for me and was very happy with their service and speed. she came back and recommended that i continue to take my car here in the future. and that is just what i've done.  i usually go on saturday afternoons and am in and out fairly quickly. the last time i went, i needed my air filter replaced too. they brought it in to show me how dusty it had gotten from all the haboobs. i would have believed them anyway, but i can see how a lot of other places would try to make some extra money telling you that you need it replaced when you don't.   they do a few other services too but i would call to ask first since they're not a full service auto shop. my boyfriend needed his brakes replaced a few months ago and he got quotes from 2 other places that said it would be $500+. he needed an oil change and of course i told him to come here. they do brake services too and did it for him for $300. they did it right then and there. we didn't have to come back or leave his car, how convenient and efficient!  the waiting room is small but clean and air conditioned. they usually have a few magazines to keep you entertained. you wont get through the whole thing anyway because they're that quick.   i'll continue to come back as long as i'm in the area and highly recommend them to anyone else in the area!",1
"i was really really looking forward to dining at benihana for lunch with my business team.  we were a few minutes late and the hostess informed us that she thought we weren't coming. what a welcome!  all 10 of us squeezed around the teppan grill and waited for our waitress. she took our drink orders and disappeared for five minutes. one of us switched seats and the waitress was completely thrown off when she returned with our beverages. what a personal touch!   we waited. and waited. and waited. had our drinks refilled, then finally the chef showed up. he complained that one of my colleagues was in the way of his food cart. he was sarcastic and condescending during the entire preparation.  the ""theatrics"" of it all were sub-par.  my memories of a joyous dining experience here were squashed.   don't be fooled--just because it's cooked in front of you doesn't qualify it as ""healthy"". everything is cooked in oil, heaps of butter, soy sauce and salt. the chicken was tough, but the sauce was deliciously spicy.   the afternoon and evening after that lunch i felt nauseous, bloated and useless. my saliva feels thick because i'm so dehydrated from the sodium and fat.    eating at benihana reinforces my commitment to eating food i can feel good about--fare that benihana does not cater to.",0
"it's not awful, but nothing really wowed me about this place. the chips and salsa are good, and their white jalapeno sauce on my chimi was great. the drinks, although huge, were pretty watered down and not alot of kick to them. probably not somewhere i would recommend to anyone for mexican food.",0
veerrrrrryyyyyyyyy dirty. i think i will buy them some clorox wipes and light bulbs for their sign out front. i made 12 u-turns trying to find this place.,0

"i feel like will ferrell in elf on seeing the sign for world's best cup of coffee: ""you did it! congratulations! world's best cup of coffee! great job, everybody!""  and really, the voted best sandwich in america sign is just like that.  it wasn't busy, but the girl at the counter seemed to be struggling. i overheard someone ask her what goes in a salad and her answer was ""i don't know, salads aren't my thing."" then i watched her incorrectly ring up the man in front of me, who politely pointed out she was overcharging him. eek.  i got the turkey sub, which isn't your typical deli sliced turkey, but more like the stuff you have after thanksgiving. i like it in concept, but it had a funny sweet flavor that wasn't working for me. the toppings on the sub were nothing special, and overall my sandwich didn't have much filling or flavor. i was eating at home, so i dressed it up myself.  the two stars come from the shop being tidy and the speedy service.",0
"i have been here a few times. was raining like crazy when i last went.  but, the place was still packed. we love it! the food is so very good.     we had a bit of a wait but, it is well worth it.   staff is friendly and the decor is very mexico looking, which is great!  lots of parking outside in the lot and you can even eat outside when it is not raining.",1
"a while ago my friends and i stopped by here for the very first time and i can't recall what we ordered but it was a thin crust pizza. the crust was crispy but not hard to where it tasted like cardboard. the ingredients tasted fresh and the pizza itself had tons of flavor! i loved it!   a week later, another girlfriend of mine and i wanted to go somewhere to eat. me being a pizza freak, i suggested pizza as told her that she had to try this place.  we got there and were seated. as i am sitting i look down at my empty plate and there was a freaking dead cricket on it!!! i was astonished! so we get up to leave; on our way out, we told someone and they said they'd seat us elsewhere! uhhhh no thank you, you can eat your own insect pizza!  no apology, no nothing!!",0
"the genius behind gallo blanco has opened up a new spot and we stopped by for paella!  i had been looking for a good paella since my trip to madrid and i have to admit i still miss my dish.. i will say that the mexican paella was pretty damn good! when you have great ingredients you have a shot at good food and when you marry that with this chef's touch you have success. they have similar dishes to gallo blanco but i appreciate the blend and uniqueness of plates like the español that change things up enough to make this another stop in my mexican stops.  try out the arroz con coco desert too, it was awesome!",1
"horrid.   i will occasionally determine whether i will attend a show based whether my love for the band outweighs my disdain for the clubhouse. some key points, in no particular order: staggeringly hot--i left the walkmen show early because i thought i was going to pass out. (when the band onstage complains that it's hot, they're probably not just making conversation...) horrible sound, especially if you are forced to stand in front of the speakers, which is hard to avoid. bathrooms? stifling, inadequate and revolting. beer sign that shines into the crowd and distracts from the acts on stage? annoying. random discarded yard sale items stored in the bar area? really? ever heard of a storage room? the fact that you have to stand by the sticky-floored bar area far away from the stage if you're drinking? ridiculous.   why do bands play here? one of the great mysteries of the universe. especially when there are places like the rhythm room nearby. the only positive thing i have to say is the guys they have staffed at the front door are always friendly.  added bonus: hope you enjoy taking your friend to the impound lot (it's across the street from tempe marketplace) because more than one of my friends has been towed from this lot before. so, if there's a sign warning you will be towed over the space you're parking in, believe it.",0
"north scottsdale is blessed to have habanero's in its' midst, and here's why..... all the other mexican food establishments in the area are corporate with little or no authenticity. mexican food in north scottsdale is pretty much styrofoamic. (is that a word? it is now). and then along came habanero's.  clearly this place is a family operation.  the menu has a nice selection and is very economically priced. fajitas are like $7, but we didn't get them. we ordered chicken nachos to start and they were wonderful. i liked that they were light on the cheese and heavy on the chicken. very tasty.  we also got blackened shrimp tacos and fish tacos.  all were excellent.  my little guy got the kid's cheese quesedella and he was happy. the tacos had great flavor. the bill was very low. keep up the good work and try this place before it gets packed.",1
"nowhere inspires my wrath more than tempe marketplace, except maybe a super walmart parking lot. but i think they're building one of those here, too. add in a babies 'r' us and you'd hit the slit-my-wrists trifecta.  kabuki would probably get three stars from me if it weren't located in the midst of this fakey-fake ""urban experience"" mall bullshit. but it is, so it doesn't.  plus, they make their iced tea with tap water and it tastes like shit.   but coworkers looooove lunching at tempe marketplace. it's close to the office, and it's easy to drive and park there (never mind that we could walk to mill ave.) so ok, fine. i'm game, unless it's maria maria.  i've been here twice -- once for lunch and once for happy hour. well, we tried to go for happy hour. it ends at 6:00. fuck you, too, kabuki. i work too late for that bullshit.   next time i'll just go to ra, where i might get severely injured eardrums from the ear-splitting club music bullshit. but at least they have cheap hh prices 'til 7:00. and they're on my drunk bus route home.",0
"my mom was raving about the grilled artichoke app she had here & said my hubby & i had to join her & my dad for dinner sometime. we went on friday night at 7:30. the place wasn't busy but it wasn't dead either. the decor is pretty dated & not really my style, but i did like the taller booths for added privacy.   my dad started off with a martini (which is so unlike him), my hubby opted for an appletini, i decided to try the cowboy sangria & my mom got a virgin pina colada. the boys enjoyed their martinis (hard to mess those up), mom also enjoyed her pina colada & my sangria was pretty good (too many seeds from the blackberries though). my hubby & i also tried their cranberry iced tea, he didn't like it but i did & drank both of ours. the bread & butter they bring out is yummy, i believe it was a pumpernickel. for an app we tried the grilled artichokes my mom kept talking up (she even ordered 1 to have with her entree, so that's 3 total!). 3 halves came on 1 order with a couple mayo-based dipping sauces, all i tasted was the mayo so i didn't care for them. the artichokes were pretty good but the server who brought them out told us that they grill them ahead of time & then microwave them before they bring them out, ew. my parents shared the steak & lobster special, dad chose the 8oz top sirloin (med-rare) & upgraded to the 9-10oz lobster tail for $3 more. for sides they chose the wedge salad & baked potato. hubby went with the steak & seafood & had the filet mignon (med) with fried shrimp, for sides he chose the wild rice & broccoli. i decided on the 6oz bacon wrapped filet mignon (med-rare), with the garlic mashed potatoes & broccoli. the lobster was bland & needed seasoning, the sides were all generic tasting & my steak was very rare (dad's was also but he enjoys bloody red, i prefer more of a pink). for dessert we all split the chocolate fudge cake. it was seriously enough for 6 people it was huge, but pretty good.   total (not including tip) was about $160, which isn't bad considering all the food & drinks we ordered, but the food was boring & tasteless. service was great though, which is why i gave 2 stars, the food deserved only 1!",0
"i'm not a vegetarian, but who can honestly resist any manner of hash slung by a cult? a cult right around the corner!!!  you dont even have to travel to california.  i came in with a good attitude, ready to acknowledge ( if not worship outright) all appropriate deities - but left a bewildered non believer.    we endured baffling service, and it pains me to say it, because there was not a hint of rudeness. just communication obstacles that i suspect involved more than language. to make a long story short, we had no idea what we ordered, despite numerous attempts to probe our waitress for such rudimentary information.  it was comic, really, until the food arrived.   my mother's vietnamese entree was more a greek tragedy of inedibly chewy mock chicken (she had asked several times for something easy to chew). mine was better, but i've forgotten what it was.  the seventh heaven salad was ok (more like third or fourth heaven) and we both liked the cup of complimentary chicken soup. that was a nice touch, and something we could all understand.   it took several minutes to communicate that we wanted a knife. i ordered  thai iced tea, which unbeknownst to me was 'code' for ice water. it's hard to get too mad though.  despite the confusion, it's about the cheapest sit down restaurant around.  people seemed nice, in an interplanetary way. we had what amounted to a disappointing pot luck, and the service was extraordinarily weird.   bon appetit !!",0
"silly name, friendly staff, small interior, generous portion, fresh flavorful ingredients, good value for the money. i had the gordon's wrap off the to-go menu - seasoned chicken (thigh?), lettuce, tomato, cucumber, potato salad wrapped in a tortilla. it came out within a few minutes. only downside was that it was a bit messy and falling apart with all that goodness contained by a thin tortilla, but quite tasty! i couldn't imagine staying for a sit-down meal because as others have mentioned it feels more like a carry-out place, but i may have to try it next time. oh, and they have signs up saying they are addressing concerns about the wait times for orders which i think shows they care. good for them -hope it works.",1
"glad to have found a dope local spot for a gyro. i finally checked this spot out for lunch and am happy as a clam. caled in my order and was ready in about 10 minute. i got the gyro pita with feta, onions and tomato. it comes with a side, so i went with fries. next time, i think i'll try the salad or potato salad. the gyro was perfect. great grilled pita, super good tzatziki (sp?) and just the right amount of flavorful gyro meat/veggies. the fries were bland and soggy, but that didn't bother me that much. i saw a ton of other stuff on the menu that i can't wait to try. can't wait to go back.  ***parking*** i found it super easy to park on the east side of central on garfield and pop a quarter in the meter to just walk across, that's probably the easiest way to handle it",1

"first let me start off by saying i say i don't go here willingly and go when the group of people i am with want to go. ok, ok, i am a sheep. this place just goes against everything that is right in this world.   getting an overpriced drink here is like a herculean task. there are always about 5-6 people deep around the entire bar waiting to get a drink. so you have to stand in the major thoroughfare in the hopes of getting drunk enough to somewhat enjoy yourself.  whilst standing there you get bumped into by drunk bachelorettes, db's, and out of towners who think this place is the tits.  i mean that spells fun in my book.  i have never eaten the food here, save the cotton candy.  so i don't know if it is any good.  the one redeeming quality is that there is no cover and the line is never very long, so you can come and go as you please without having to have the tell tale stamp the next morning.  oh, don't get me started on the bull!",0
"sauce is another restaurant that i really want to like more, but just can't get any enthusiasm for every time i go there.  the two star rating is perfect for this place.  it's ""meh"".  always just ""meh"".  it's never amazing, it's never terrible.  even this review is gonna end up being ""meh"" simply because there's just nothing to say about the place.  if you're looking for something to eat that costs just a bit more than it's worth and leaves you feeling just a little unsatisfied, well then, sauce is for you.",0

"a generic name for a generic chain of generic italian food.  there is a hint of greek flavor in some of their dishes, due to a certain type of greek cheese used in some of the pastas, but other than that, the dishes we had were just ok, nothing too special.  their redeeming quality is that entrees include a drink, soup or salad, and dessert.  entrees will run you around 11-15 dollars.",0
"i've never, ever used the word ""meh,"" but i have to for this place.  it's really cute, decorated nicely and the waitstaff was great, if a bit slow.  fresh homemade tortilla chips and salsa were the key to my enjoyment of the food here.  i pigged out on them!  julia and i were in that ""i'm so hungry i'm cranky"" mood, so i stuffed my face with the chips forever.  fresh baskets were brought often, as well as each of us getting our own salsa bowl.  oh, and a complimentary bowl of guac can't hurt, either! then the entree came.  i was wanting ooey-gooey, cheese-smothered enchiladas.  i got the mushroom and spinach.  it came with a side of black beans and rice.  the enchiladas were made properly: the tortillas were soft-fried properly before adding the fillings.  but, not a lot of stuffing!  a few mushrooms, a few leaves of lettuce and that's pretty much it.  they were ""covered"" in a green sauce.  barely covered in green sauce.  i was disappointed, to say the least.  the rice?  nothing fancy.  the beans?  meh! the only thing that saved my meal was the company (julia and dossty!) and the never-ending supply of chips.   i probably won't go back.  mariscos playa hermosa is right near there and i'd make that drive anyday!",0
"cadillac ranch seems like the scottsdale away from scottsdale. i've been here a few times and the crowd has always seemed stuck up.  i can't comment on the food as i've never tried it... so all i'm commenting on is the bar hoppers and the bar tenders.  the bar staff was nice one time... but i think it was just because i went there when it was slow and they (she) would come talk to me. however, the other time i went i may as well jumped behind the bar and made my drink myself... i'm not even sure they would have noticed. maybe this isn't a slam to the bartenders themselves as maybe they were understaffed... as it was to the owners.   i dunno... i just haven't had the best time here.",0
"meh.  my standards for quality froyo are high since i frequent yogurtology (shea and scottsdale), yogurtland (i'm the duke in scottsdale), and sometimes i go to mojo in tempe.   this place has ""ok"" flavors. i had the original tart, that was quite a bit tart. the toppings are ok. my friend really liked the fact that they have banana chips, but that's because we usually eat our froyo at home and we were far away from home, and she didn't have to use her personal stash.   since it made her happy, i gave this place an extra star. i'm cool like that.  hmm...let's see. they have a snow machine. not really sure what this is for. it seems out of place.   it's far from my house, and not really worth my drive. i guess if it was by my house, and i had no other options, i'd frequent this business.   this is the one time, and one time only that i will say this.....thank god, i live in old town scottsdale.",0
"ah,cibo. i was really expecting to be won over by this place and would have been if it wasn't for the horrible service from our waiter, james. drinks and appetizers were lovely, so we asked james for pizza recommendations. he recommended the di notte and the capriccosa. initially, i was put off by the artichokes listed on the capricossa, but after a quick consultation with my boyfriend, we decided it would be fine and followed those recommendations. our pizzas arrived, the di notte and vegetariana. wait, what?  we left the vegetariana untouched and called james over to correct the mistake. he caused a big, loud and embarrassing scene, presenting as defensive and aggressive as he raised his voice and refused to correct the error. he insisted that we had ordered the vegetariana because we didn't want the artichokes on the capricossa. when we pointed out there were artichokes on the vegetariana and that it wasnt our pizza, james said, ""well, they're only on one quadrant of the pizza. you want me to pick them off for you?""  when there is a table of 12 to verify a story, and two costumers have a different version of the event than the server, i think it's time to admit the mistake and move on. i was shocked by his behavior and apparently so was some of the other staff as they came over to apologize for his rudeness. i have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant before, which is not something i had ever expected to say about cibo.  the food and ambiance were wonderful, but if service is poor, it ruins the experience and makes me reluctant to spend money here again. maybe i'd consider if we could get melissa as our waitress, who remained sweet and attentive and made efforts from the cash bar to make us feel welcome again. service is such a key element in a restaurant and our server was entirely blind to this fact--although i guess it didn't matter much to him since his gratuity was already added in.",0
"hands down, crudo is one of my favorite restaurants in phoenix.    everything on their menu is phenomenal. i highly recommend the ahi and the albacore; the fish is so fresh and delicious that i'm practically salivating just thinking about it.    i've eaten in the restaurant several times as well as sitting at the bar for happy hour.  their bartender micah has got to be one of the best mixologists in phoenix, and will blow your mind with some amazing creations.  there's been many times that i've asked him to surprise me with a drink, and he's put together some truly delicious off-menu cocktails.   i really don't have enough good things to say about this restaurant.  i took my mother here once when she was visiting from san diego, and she now insists that we go here every time she's in town.  so if you haven't been yet, go!",1

"more than a year ago i wrote a review about lucille's and i wasn't impressed. this weekend i made my first re-visit since writing that review. this time it was friday night with ebony k., her friend, and her friend's parents. the restaurant was accommodating to changing the original reservation from 3 to 5, and we were seated quickly.  overall the food was excellent - you can read about it in ebony's review, but i will say my chicken was excellent. as a side i ordered the sweet mashed potatoes (which everyone ordered). as a tip it is mashed sweet potatoes and not some type of sweet mashed potatoes. also i went with the cheesy grits - and they were that. the chicken was moist and had a great flavor. everything about the food and the atmosphere was excellent and much improved from my first visit (but i still didn't eat the watermelon slice)....  one thing that was a little below the food was the service. while the staff was very friendly, they did appear to be a bit slow. we asked for vinegar and for hot sauce; we asked for hot water for coffee; we asked for diet coke after the tea was weak. each of these requests had to be repeated twice.   i have to say, i was more impressed - the atmosphere, the company, the food was all excellent. a little less with the multiple repeat requests and it will be excellent. and thanks to ebony k. for getting me to give lucille's a second chance.",1
"i had two gift certificates to this place so we tried it.  i wasn't excited after reading the reviews but it is like watching a movie someone says is bad.  you really want it to be better than it is.  the ambiance is very stale.  my husband actually said it smelled ""old"".   we were the youngest people in there other than the staff by 25 or 30 years.  the manager was incredibly friendly which was a plus but our server was very slow.  the food tasted like cafeteria food very average.  my husband had a steak on onion rings and i had coconut shrimp each right around $20 a plate.  they serve a lot of food you could easily share an entree.",0
"if i was reviewing only the sandwiches here i'd give them a 5 star review! the sandwiches here are the best. they make them with super fresh, the breads are great, and they simply put together great combinations of ingredients. you cannot go wrong with the sandwich option. the pastries are also fantastic! everything from the scones to muffins are delicious!   unfortunately, the breakfast burritos and coffee are just mediocre (ironic when it is called the coffee shop).  my recommendation is to come here for lunch. it is a wonderful spot for lunchtime!",1
"the hot chocolate at scratch in scottsdale is to die for - so, i have been not so patiently waiting for scratch to open up a mile from my house.  i went on their soft opening to order my beloved hot chocolate and they said they didn't have the chocolate ganache at that location yet but to try back in a few days.  okay, no worries, it was their soft opening. i understood and went back to eagerly waiting.   about 2 - 3 weeks after my original visit, i went back to finally get some of this parisian hot chocolate!  we sat down outside and ordered french fries, a latte for my man, and my hot chocolate.  the latte came.  the water came.  the fries came.  the hot chocolate never came - now, i was being patient because i know this takes about 5 - 10 minutes to make at their scottsdale location.  when i inquired with the waiter, it was obvious he had forgotten it and came back 5 minutes later explaining the cafe did not serve the hot chocolate - but the pastry shop did.  the pastry shop downtown was not open yet and no one in the cafe knew how to make it.  then why the hell (pardon my french) is hot chocolate listed on 2 different menus for the cafe?!   i felt like the whole visit was a waste because we would not have ordered the watered-down latte or fries if we were informed about hot chocolate at the beginning - after all, we were really only there for that.   i'm about to give up on this place and fly to paris.  edit (04/04):  i was walking the dog around the neighborhood and noticed the pastry shop was open.  i asked for a hot chocolate.  and, get this, no one there knew how to the work the machine to make it. ahhhhh!!!",0
"first of all omg, they have the best ice cream in town, or even in the us.   i'm normally frozen yogurt girl, but this ice cream is amazing.     so, i have been here a couple times now.  the first time i had the coffee ice cream. it tasted just like coffee, but better.   then the second time i had the peanut butter, coconut and butter pecan.  now these 3 flavors were amazing together.     all i can say is that i know that i will definitely be coming back here for ice cream in the near future.  :)",1
"i think this place could do a lot better considering it is one of the premiere farmers markets in the city. have only been here once so will update as we go more often.  i did buy some handmade soap. it turned out to be wonderful. it smells divine and is all natural. i prefer it over lush soaps.  the food trucks were nothing what i had read about in the online reviews. we only saw like three or four and the one we wanted to eat at, her catfish ran out just as we approached the window.",1
"i have had much better bbq, with much better service, for way less money than at lucille's.  i was excited to try the place because my parents had really talked it up, but maybe i just went in with too high of expectations. the hostess had misplaced a few brain cells and asked our party about 5-6 times what our name was, even though they had one of our numbers to call when the table was ready. our water was ok, but super slow when it came to the checks and actually checking in on us. i liked the biscuits, but they were not amazing, a nice touch after waiting for so long to get a table though. no one in my party was amazed by their meals but one of the most disappointing was the mac and cheese. it sounded so good, but came out dry and mushy- gross enough to turn you off of mac and cheese for a couple of weeks.  so-so food, extremely loud restaurant- it will take a while before i consider to give it a second shot.",0
"i really love this place!! nothinglike a fun sunday meal with my family to make me love it even more. we stuffed ourselves with delish catfish, fried shrimp , and tasty hazelnut mahi. service from rocky was  really fast , effiecient without that fake cloying attitude. felt like we were the center of the restaurant. funny how things like fast drink refills, quick service and welltime plate removal can do that.   and here is the kicker of the evening ..i know have ordered or tasted every dessert on thier dessert tray, scary but true. did you know that three of their desserts are made fresh there the rest including cheesecakes are made in texas and brought in. i got the fresh brulee  . yummy.   can't wait to go back.",1
"this review gets a 5 star just on the chef himself.   as i walk in, the lady that i believe owns the restaurant seats me, but is a little busy with some other tables.. i was taken back some since the chef noticed me and comes out of the kitchen and proceeds to help me out with the choices on the menu. no kitchen staff has actually ever given me personal recommendations on food, talk about awesome!! i ask him about the purple corn drink on the menu, so he gets a small sample of it for me. kinda fruity, sweet, but not an overwhelm of sugar. so i ordered a glass of that.  as my eyes scan past the rotisserie chicken dish,  i asked him if i could get that, in which he says they only serve that fri.-sun. damn. he then helps me pick out the pollo saltado (stirred fried chicken with fries).  they automatically bring a bun with a special spicy sauce with every meal, the sauce has the perfect spice to it. the dish itself was slightly oily, but was pretty good. could have used a little more rice, but the whole thing was definitely an interesting and new taste for me.  excellente!",1
"i was pleasantly surprised by this museum. it has a lot of great artwork and the collections are diverse too. they have modern art, mexican, asian, impressionism (monet!!!), paintings, sculptures, pottery, and funky stuff. you can spend a lot of time there. it is spacious and a well kept museum. i really recommend it. i say go on first friday so you don't have to pay the admission cost.",1
"met some friends here on a friday night and waited over 2 hours to get a table. i have never ever waited that long to get a table, anywhere but i am soooo glad we did.  the service was impeccable and the food was to die for.  so good and different than anything i have had in a long time.  the prices were great too, which just made this an amazing experience all around.  totally would get 5 stars if i didn't have to wait 2 hours.",1
"not quite as good as the main location, but still kicks ass!  my only critique is that they don't serve a complimentary chunky salsa along with their hot salsa.    get the agua fresca, try an appetizer (we like the queso dip w mushrooms) and finish with one of the many torta options they have.    personally, i love anything with steak at los reyes.  if they cool it fresh, it's incredible and very authentic!  my wife had the steak fajita plate thing and i had the steak torta.  her steak was obviously fresher and hotter.. absolutely delicious!!!  mine was warm, but not quite as freshly cooked.  still tasty as hell, but i wish they were more consistent.  they have some cool fresh fruit options here.  both in the agua fresca and in their dessert options.  not too pricy either!  note:  the main location was featured on man vs food (food network),  adam had the loaded torta (forgot the name but you'll see it!)",1
"wow, daren says this place has the best orange chicken and i don't know if i could find him to be more wrong.  no offense to daren, he's a good guy with good reviews but this chicken was terrible.  it looked and had the texture of calamari - not chicken.  the sauce they drown the things in was excellent but the texture of the chicken was disgusting.  i couldn't possibly ever go back here simply because of that.  i'll stick with china chili's orange chicken, thank you.",0
"i remember driving down the alley a while ago and passing a garbage can with a rather sophomoric retort to the restaurant's quickly declining food quality. while callow, i admit to having giggled and nodding. accurate, in a sense, that the phrase was ""puke bread"". basically, yeah.   i am somewhat biased, as i did work there for a bit, but in this particular scenario, i feel i can identify what other reviewers have noted in regards to the service.   just so you know, yes, the servers are nonplussed about you being there. no, they don't actually like the food, and chances are, they have a different manager than they had the week before.  so, why two stars you ask? have you seen the martinis? whew. worth my $10.",0
i'm just gonna do the damn thing and give this place 5 stars.... they seriously have the best coleslaw ever!!! i hate coleslaw and this stuff is really good. i love the cilantro in it and how it is not too saucy unlike myself.,1
"this is my first to visit this place, though i've passed it several times. my friend and i just finished having days from hell  at work and we needed some vino to soothe our frayed nerves. i suggested going here to give it a try and also for a change of scenery. upon walking in, we were greeted warmly. we sat ourselves on two really squishy couches (not comfy). well, we got our wine order and were left to chat. first thing i noticed, the music. i began to contemplate whether or not  ""it takes two"" by robb base was a good music selection while trying to unwind and chill with a glass of sauvignon blanc..hmm i'm still thinking no. second thing i noticed was that the really young servers and bartenders were talking about deep issues of the world, but it was the explicative shouted out by the bartender who was making a very serious point, that caught our attention. i believe my friend said ""classsssy!"" in response. so i guess that if you want to chill and have a mellow chat, my wine cellar is maybe not the place for it. maybe it was an off day i don't know. on to the wine prices. i've never seen a wine bar that had all one price for all the wines on their list. it's silly. really. and the happy hour prices aren't that wonderful. the glasses are 10 dollars, but at happy hour they're 8. not that big of a price break considering 8 bucks is usually a regular priced glass of wine elsewhere. just an observation. food... not spectacular. we sent back the hummus platter we ordered because the bread was cold, i mean out of the fridge, slap it on the plate cold. the hummus was just not tasty at all. and i love hummus. we then got the bruscetta platter, we ordered the basil, tomato,mozzarella, and the sun dried tomato with goat cheese. both were very tasty. then we moved on to the chicken sticks with lemon grass. not my favorite. yes you can have too much lemongrass. i don't know if we'll go back to visit my wine cellar. i doubt it. at least we gave it the good college try.",0
"found this place on accident looking for a new sandwich place downtown. i have been here quite a few times, and for 7$ getting a huge sandwich is quite the deal. highly recommend it, just get their early because this place fills up at lunch time with a line out the door sometimes.",1
"i thought this place was crap, but my gf didnt think it was that bad. the menu was nothing special, typical phoenix restaurant choices. they ran out of the scallop dish at 7pm. we waited about 45 minutes for our food on a wednesday night. the choices were overpriced. and my mashed potatoes were cold. nuff said.  gf thinks the mussels were good though.",0
"i like to think of myself as a very fair-minded person...almost the embodiment of the word...not ""person"", ""fair""!  i am like a living ""spirit of justice""...right down to the blindfold, the scales and the toga (exposing  one manly boob).  no one is going to put the peek-a-boo brassiere of prejudice on me (like the bushies tried to do to the actual spirit of justice a few years ago)...no siree!  so it was with love for all burgers and objectivity in my heart that i rolled in to the grind on a couple of warm afternoons, not so very long ago.  and i just wasn't very impressed...the burger wasn't bad by any means...but it wasn't great either...esp. at the price point...unfortunately.  i expected more!  * more burger choices...only three choices on the menu...it's called the grind...do they only ""grind"" enough beef for three burger choices? maybe they will cobble up something else, if you want, but frankly...i'm paying for them to figure the menu out and prepare the food for me...if i want to figure it out myself, i'll stay home and make my own.  * more flavor...i've tried the place twice, burgers both times and the peppercorn burger and the sweet and starchy burger (i may have that wrong)...both were...what's the word i'm groping for here...adequate...completely...adequate. i kind of expect a place like this to knock my socks off (if, of course, i were to ever wear socks), but it just doesn't.  * more for my money...it's $16 - $17 for a burger and beverage, by the time i tip...i'm not complaining about the price...i'm complaining about what i get for the price!  * more better service...ok, i know...bad grammar...i should say ""better more"" service...the joint wasn't exactly jumpin' either time i dropped in and yet getting a beverage and lunch took a long time...a really long time...a 90 minute long time one of the times i was there...how long does it take to undercook a burger on a super duper unique and special ""one million degree"" grill? the burgers should have vaporized in the time it took to get them to the table!  but in fairness to the grind (always the hallmark of my little yelp stories), i made sure that i re-tried some of my other favorite burgers...you know...wcg, fez, daily dose, modern burger, davids, zinburger, lucky boy, even in-n-out!  ok, you caught me...it was really more of an excuse to go on a burger binge...i do love them so!  at any rate, all of them still measure up quite nicely...and all of them make better burgers than the grind!  the grind is certainly nowhere near the bottom of the barrel...the décor is very nice on the inside (although the little old mall at 40th and camelback is where restaurants go to die...not pleasant from the outside).  the wait staff seem nice enough whenever you get a chance to see them and interact with them (which isn't that often during the course of a lunch, as it turns out)...i don't know if it's a kitchen issue or that the wait staff is ""slower than ass end of hard times"" (a saying from the depression era...no, the other depression era...although it certainly seems apropos enough these days).  res ipsa loquitur...  so, as i stand in judgment...the very physical embodiment of the spirit of justice...my judgment is that the grind is a 2.75 star experience, and as everyone knows, justice is blind, favors no one (except the wealthy) and never rounds up...so 2 stars it is.",0
"i love ikea. its just goodlooking cheap furniture. which is excellent for me since i change my mind about stuff so fast, it wont cost me an arm and a leg to decorate that way. i also love their lingonberry jam and swedish meatballs. oh ikea you only have one problem. tempe. wy must you be in tempe? why must it be that everytime i go in you i must see some rotund mormon mother waddling around in her demin jumper gone shapeless dress? why must you be a day trip? its okay though... i forgive you ikea.",1
"i needed to shave the bottoms off some doors after installing new flooring, and i found duane ""diamond d"" on this cool website called yelp.com. i gave him a call and he came out the next afternoon - he sawed the doors, did a few other things around the house, was very pleasant to speak with, and the price tag came in less than i would have expected.   highly recommended.",1
"this was our first time visiting the parlor. we had friends in town and came here after visiting zoo lights. they were able to seat us immediately and took great care of us. the ambiance is great and since we had a little one with us they took extra care to make sure he had a cup with a straw and something to snack on quickly. the adults started with a meat and cheese platter which was awesome!!!! for pizzas we ordered a 12 inch salsiccia and a 10 inch pesto. both were delicious but the salsiccia was the favorite of the table. i can see why it has won awards, it is delicious! we will definitely return!",1
"quaint looking place, but i don't understand the draw.   food is okay but nothing special and service was below par.  now i haven't dined with this business since it moved to this location.  last time i ate at the farm house it was a tiny farmhouse alongside the road. server was kinda slow and really not familiar with the specials cuz ""she doesn't usually work on thursdays"".  whatever.  i mean there are only two (2) specials and juevos rancheros can be complicated. well i will get back to the food... the ambiance is kitschy, simple, and sorta rustic.  the restaurant is small so it is no surprise to see long lines outside this place on a weekend morning.   so i ordered the juevos rancheros special and my son ordered the pancakes with eggs and bacon.  we determined we could have had a better breakfast elsewhere. seriously.  pancakes seemed to be from a mix and my juevos rancheros were nothing more then eggs to order on top of corn tortilla and topped with red enchillada sauce (canned?!) with refries (canned?) and a sliced potato on the side.  oh my, don't tell my nm, mexican, tex -mex food fans. now canned isn't such a bad thing if it is done well but this seemed straight from the can.   and on top of the less than mediocre meal a guy in the booth behind me was kicking on my side of the bench, talking loudly on his phone the entire time we were there to his homie about a girl with issues (his words).   prices didn't seem appropriate for food.  maybe because of the location but certainly not the food. not coming back.",0
"a friend and i went for lunch today to gingerroot.  they had what looked like a buffet but they called it 'combination' (means it is not all-u-can-eat), though you could do the a-la-carte menu.  they had about 7 options at the buffet-looking counter - all contained 'meat' (shrimp, pork, chicken, fish, etc).  i had the laing (coconut milk w/ shrimp and taro leaves w/ pork bits) and the chicken adobo.  the lady (maybe the owner) was very friendly and was very welcoming and even gave us little plates to sample whatever we wanted to sample before we ordered - that was really helpful!  i absolutely loved my chicken adobo - it had so much flavor that i found myself sucking on the chicken fat just to get more of that flavoring.  sadly, after i devoured the chicken, i started on the laing and found i could not stomach it....at alllll.  i drank some water and gave it another shot.. nope, not going down.  i think it was the stark flavor difference between the chicken and the laing that made my nostrils pick up something in the laing that just did not appeal to me.. maybe it was the fishyness of the shrimp, or maybe the slight tang/bitterness of the taro leaves... or the smell of pork fat mixed with coconut milk.... not sure, but when i taste-tested it earlier, i was excited to eat it... after the chicken, i couldn't even smell it .. something was so off-putting.  how odd is that?  anyway, i can't hold that against them - i approved it after tasting it at first... i guess something was obviously off with me.  the bill was cheap (7ish or so for me) .. and i took a turon to go (banana/jackfruit/wrapped in rice paper and fried to a crips/topped with browned sugar) ... so yummy!  i would return becuase the service was great - friendly, not stingey with portions (generous), educational, genuine; and the chicken was stellar.. plus the other dish my friend got was also super tasty.. so i know there's more there i could definitely try next time.",1
"this is one of my favorite pizza places!! it's a tiny little place with hardly any room, but i think that's what gives it the charm that it has. the pizza is delicious and the girl who normally works the counter is super friendly. they have great lunch specials for those looking for a quite bite. did i mention how much i love this pizza?",1
"this was my first visit ever and i have heard so much about this place for 2 years now!  i had a margarita pizza and the pablo salad  (shared with boyfriend). the pizza was good, thin and crispy and the salad was massive and delicious. our friends had the pablo salad and the shrimp salad and both were great.the service was a little slow since we ate at the bar, but that's because it was busy. our bartender was nice and polite and found the time to chat with us for a little but despite being busy.  the menu is so huge that i think i was a little overwhelmed at first but would love to go back and try some of the other items.",1
"even with the new openings of boba shops over the years since my review of the street, i still find it to have one of the tastiest places to get dessert and drinks.  they have added ramen and dumpling soup to their menu, for a ""hot eats, cool treats"" type atmosphere, only korean style!  the quality is still the same, although the ""diamond ice"" (a.k.a. pat bing soo) is served in a disposable styrofoam bowl instead of a glass bowl, probably for easier clean up.  they've expanded their drink menu, but my favorite is still the fresh fruit smoothies where you can mix up to 3 fruits for a refreshing cool beverage.  the boba is also still quite good, with a perfect mix of chewiness and sweetness.",1
"while i'm not buying the whole yogurt fad, i will admit there are some pretty good yogurt places around town. yogurt is good when its done right, and when there are some 'exotic' flavors to try. acai berry from yogurtland is absolutely one my all-time favorites. but then you have places like this which focus on mediocrity.  i'm not trying to bash on this place, but if you've been to both yogurtland (near asu) and zoyo you'd be confused as to where you were. i'm not even joking. the yogurt cups look exactly the same sans the logo, and the dispensing machines look the same to the tee, including the cool lcd screens above them. i think the only difference between this place and yogurtland is that this place has mediocre flavors.  flavors...that's pretty much the only thing that matters when it comes to frozen yogurt. while its awesome to have the basics, this place seemed to play it too safe. if i want plain vanilla and chocolate yogurt i think i'll just go to mcdonald's and get an ice cream cone. the only thing this place excelled at was a plethora of toppings. i would have to say there are over 3-4 dozen different toppings. i suppose if you want a large variety of toppings then this place isn't a bad idea. however, if you're trying to eat healthy (what's the point of eating yogurt if you're not?) then what's the point of toppings?  i can understand how such a coincidence could occur, both franchises probably use the same exact supplier. this just makes things confusing. it's like having to pick between honda and toyota. both are 'japanese' cars manufactured in the us, and have comprable features. it comes down to personal preference. you have to take each for a test drive and figure out what works best for you.",0
"this is the first time i have ever been here. my boy and i came here for brunch on sunday morning.  it is very clean which is nice, however, i did not check out the restroom,so i cannot rate it. the food was excellent. the breakfast potatoes were really good.                                                         i had the fritata which was fabulous with spinach inside and crumbled feta cheese on top. my boyfriend got the wrangler, his was really good as well except the bacon. he said they used to serve better bacon and this was a cheaper version of something eatable.                                       other than that though very good. i liked the coffee it was quite strong. the pieces of bread that they give you for toast are huge, also very good. they don't have coupons which is a bit of a bummer. however, if you are looking to splurge this is the place. it was a little loud in there because, there was a table of children.                                                                                but, hey , what can you do??? kids are loud!",1
"i'm probably the lone dissenter in the land of five star reviews here, but here goes.   i wanted to love matt's. it's adorable and close to home.   i don't eat pork, which eliminated a good portion of the menu right off the bat. that's fine, it's not like i expect restaurants to cater to me, that's what my kitchen is for.   i had the cheese omelet. it was good, but could have used some spices. the hash browns were ok, despite the fact that they were floating in their own grease.   matt's is great if you like breakfast with a bucket of grease on the side. it made me sick, so i won't be back.",0
"this location is a bit of a hike from mi casa, but it's worth the drive. in general, i think sauce is a little pricey for lunch but the price point is perfect for dinner.  i usually get the thin crust pizza with sausage, pepperoni, onion and peppers and tell them to hold the mushrooms. the meatball panini is an excellent choice as well. last time my wife got the bruschetta which she thought was fabulous. i saw another patron scarfing down the spaghetti and meatballs, so that's the next item on the menu i'm going to try.   i love the casual atmoshere where you can kick back and relax and have a mellow conversation. there's plenty of seating and the parking is plentiful in the evening since the coffee shop next door closes before dinner.",1
fantastic place - they have possibly the freshest fish in the valley.  their menu is extremely interesting and the servers are eager to make recommendations and describe anything on the menu you don't understand.    i do recommend a reservation at dinner at it's gets rather crowded.  don't miss the cocktails made with sochu.,1
"this will be short and sweet...which i usually don't do. aj's fine foods...has fine food and great presentation...but the prices are absolutely not worth it for the exact same products at other stores. i guess there is only one kind of customer that would shop here...and that is a foolish one...again especially for the same exact products. eat, drink and be merry my friends...just don't do it at aj's fine foods.",0
"yuppha's is my favorite thai spot. its got great food, atmosphere service, and even a live band on some nights. its a fun place with awesome food. i have yet to be disappointed after countless meals.",1
"this place has super tasty food! for a casual dining place where you order at the counter and seat yourself, i was really impressed. i ordered the chicken kabob entrée with a salad as my side. the salad exceeded my expectations - it was very fresh, the lettuce was crisp, and it came with a lot of toppings: bell pepper, olives, tomato slices, cucumber, red onion, and chunks of feta cheese. the dressing was a nice basic vinaigrette.  i was expecting my chicken to come on a stick, but it was actually just big chunks of chicken on a bed of rice with a side of lettuce, tomato, and red onion.  i didn't mind because it was actually easier to eat that way. the chicken was flavorful and juicy and the rice was delicious and cooked just right. it reminded me of something you would order at pita jungle, but it cost about $3 less here.  this is not the best mediterranean food i've ever had in my life, but for $9 it was a great value and really tasty food. i'd definitely come back again!",1
so good  so freeaking good   sooooooooooooooooo good  my wife hates my love for kokomo  the young ladies working are always so friendly and nice. they keep that place very clean.,1
"$8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg, two greasy strips of bacon, and a stale muffin. they say it's pricy because they get it local? it has to have substance to be considered anything. so whack.",0
"if you've been to the other locations, you're already familiar with the food (which, by itself, is probably 3-stars) and the chambord margaritas (which, by themselves, garner 4 stars from me), so i won't delve into those things.  i love the location, although parking is a problem.  the complimentary valet is a nice touch, but it takes a while for them to bring your car around because it seems like the poor guys have to run all the way down to missouri to park your car.  the windows are huge doors that they open up at night, which is a really nice touch.  the design is much more open and light than their other locations.",1
"i had a chicken panini and was more than enough! it was dinner and lunch!  they have this special bread that is like a big bun. the people is very friendly and patient to explain their different options. nice place, and for sandwiches it was just good.",1
"total ripoff!.  i ordered an iced tea, a salad, and a filet mignon and my total bill was almost $55!  to add insult to injury, i was still starving when i left.  the salad was beyond bland and consisted of about a dozen small lettuce leaves with a couple of strings of purple cabbage that were completely under-dressed resulting in overpriced cow feed.    the filet cost $32 and came with nothing but 3 miniature beets (and i mean about the size of a radish) and 2 small lettuce leaves.  the meat was completely under-seasoned and bland as you could get.    so that's it.  for about $40 i got a minuscule piece of meat on a paper thin slice of bread, 3 radish sized beets and a few lettuce leaves.  i wanted to hit  in and out burger afterwards to kill my hunger pangs.  what a weak meal!  i'll will never go back to this establishment again.  granted it has good ambiance and stylish decor, but that only makes it a restaurant of style over substance.   i know these guys have major overhead to pay for in their new location, but ripping off your customers is not the way to do it!",0
"i went here excited by the prospect of mixing alcohol and ice cream, the perfect combo!  we braved the downtown scottsdale crowds and lack of parking on a saturday night just so we could try the ice cream here.  i asked the attendant which rum based ice cream he'd recommend, which was the strawberry amaretto rum.  it sounded delicious, so i decided to go with the recommendation and get a scoop to go.  eating it in the car on the way back home, the more i ate, the more the ice cream tasted like cherry.  on second thought, i didn't taste any amaretto or rum in the ice cream either.  i couldn't taste any alcohol in the ice cream.  then, i came to the realization that i was given a scoop of what tasted like cherry cheesecake ice cream, non-alcoholic, not strawberry amaretto rum, even though it was labeled as such.  disappointed, it tasted ok, but i'm not a fan of cherry cheesecake in general, and i was wanting a signature alcoholic ice cream dessert.  so due to mislabeling, i'm going to have to dock a lot of stars.",0
"been to two of the locations and this one was not as good. the food nor the building measured up to my first visit to a scottsdale location, which madr me a fan.   here i had to send my chicken katsu back because it was cooked so hard that it was not enjoyable and not eatable.  the macaroni salad here isn't as creamy and good as it is at the other location i've gone to.  and the cabbage comes cooked on this plate at this location.  the restaurant is bigger  here but the place isn't kept as cool as it needs to be to dine in comfort on a hot day.  then there's an awful overpowering smell of water damaged ceilings/walls that just made me think this location wasn't clean.",0
"still as good as i remembered!   this visit around i tried the following: alcapurrias (picadillo stuffed croquette made from tropical vegetable masa) tostones (twice-fried green plantains) arroz con gandules (pigeon peas cooked with rice, pork, olives and capers) mofongo (crushed plantains and pork cracklings) sangria made with red wine cortadito (café cubano laced with steamed milk)  between the tostones & the calypso chips, i prefer the calypso chips.  the arroz con gandules is very good, you can really taste the saltiness of the capers. the mofongo were my absolute favorites :d  they are very basic, but who needs more?! as far as the cortadito goes, i'm pretty sure that i could feel my pupils dilating as i was drinking the tiny cup down, lol. if this is a diluted cuban coffee, i'm not sure i'm ready for the real deal! even though it was strong, or perhaps because it was so strong, i feel like i'm hooked! :)   word of warning, if you don't like garlic, you need to really consider your choices. i don't think there are many dishes made without the use of garlic.",1
"**** outstanding ****   whenever i need to ""get a away"" but don't have the time to actually pack up and travel, i book a massage and spend the afternoon at joya.   the joya spa is immense, but not intimidating... the decor is moorish luxury at its finest,. although many spas have attempted a ""theme"" none have applied it as well as joya. the environment is soothing and authentic without being overbearing or tacky.   i suggest to arrive an hour and a half early, to relax, swim, enjoy some beverages at the private spa pool on the 2nd floor ( breath taking views of camelback mountain ) and enjoy the facilities. relax in the spacious facilities... including steam room and hot tub then follow with a cold ""deluge"" shower. imagine 5 gallons of chilling water released all at once... amazing!!.....it ""shocks"" your body back into reality. then hang out in the lounge area, watch some tv, enjoy some fruits, tea or water and wait for your treatment.   although the entire staff at the spa is fantastic, for me, the shining star of the massage staff is jean baptiste. his technique is brilliant! i always feel great after his massages, which i cannot say about past massages at other spas here in the valley. i find his massages to be intense, yet relaxing, he pinpoints and addresses stress areas in seconds... its like having a physical therapist, sports medicine and masseur all at once. outstanding!   inquire about their current spa happy hour, a massage for about $115.00 including tip...and if you plan it right, you can be rested and out the door by 5:30p to walk over to the mbar for their happy hour!   imagine...two happy hours in one day.. a quarter of the way to having a lindsy lohan lifestyle!",1
"i have been to la bocca about 6 times, and each time this place has been very good. i have tried several pizzas, several salads, the antipasto plate, and the bruschetta. all have been really tasty. so i went here tonight with the bf before we went to see stephen hawking for his birthday (the bf's, not sh's). we went for happy hour, intending to just get a bruschetta plank, but ended up being super hungry and getting a bunch of food. we were seated right away, which was nice. for happy hour, all wine and beer by the glass is half off. we ordered some wine, i got the riesling and he got the pinot grigio. i really liked the riesling and he liked the pinot, but i wasn't a fan. to each his own though. so we ordered the bruschetta plank with the prosciutto, fig, and mascarpone, the tomato, mozz, basil, and balsamic, the pulled pork and peston, and the garlic, arugula, and goat cheese. they were all excellent. so in comparison to postino, i'd say these are on par (with the tomato and mozz one being way better here). plus we didn't have to wait forever for the food. each piece of bruschetta is smaller than the ones at postino though. we ended up ordering a margherita pizza. this was so good, it was exactly what i expect in a good margherita pizza. it had whole leaves of basil and the mozz clearly came from a ball of cheese and not shredded cheese. it all tasted really fresh. i thought this pizza was much better than the marg. i got at classic italian pizza a few weeks ago. the crust was a lot less burnt and the toppings tasted fresher. then, cuz it's the bf's bday, we got an order of tiramisu. mmmmm this was so good! the tiramisu did not have an overwhelming alcohol flavor, but a very light coffee flavor that was very tasty. it had a really good sized piece of tiramisu with two little wafers in it and some chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce on the side. it was excellent! this was one of the best meals i've had in awhile, and i don't know if it was the wine, but this was also the best meal i've had at la bocca.",1
"although we usually don't go out on a monday night, we had a guest in town and the next day off from work so the opportunity had to be taken advantage of! i always forget about this place as it's tucked away location doesn't lend itself to a highly visible sign to jog my memory.  there was a jazz band playing and a $5pp cover charge. we opted for cocktails this evening rather than wine. although they were very good, two of the selections we wanted were ""out"", which is a little odd.  we got the tomato-mozz flatbread, the manchego cheese and the fondue as well. everything tasted very delicious as we cleaned out plates! service was good and the decor in this place is so awesome. it makes you feel like you're in the basement of some speakeasy. bar stool tables, couches, it's very cozy, dim, cool. need to come here more often!",1
"the wait can be a bit extreme at time but if you bring a friend to talk to it helps the time pass.  however, i wouldn't recommend waiting out there in the heat if it's 100+ outside that's for sure.  as for the food, the pesto pork chops and rosemary potatoes will satisfy any man's appetite.  in general, the handful of times i have been there never disappointing but i also have never been blown out of the water either.  i will still keep going back though.",1
"while we were finishing up at forefathers, i checked my mobile yelp app to see what else was in the area.  zoyo popped up and the reviews were good so i asked my daughter if she wanted dessert.  silly me, of course she said yes! it was a short drive to zoyo.  i passed it the first time cause my gps said it was on my right but nooooo it was on the left.  we made a quick u-turn and there we were.    it was clean and well lit and nicely laid out.  if i remember correctly there were either 10 or 12 different flavors.  i had red velvet and banana.  yum!  the red velvet was delish!  my daughter had rv and cake batter.  they had all the standard toppings and the topping area as well as the yougurt area was very clean.  the young people (oh god i sound old!) that were tending to the counter were pretty efficient and friendly.  there was pleanty of seating too.  some nice larger, round tables and then what looked like a hallway had some smaller tables for two.  there were also tables outside.  it was a saturday night and there seemed to be a steady stream of people coming in while we were there.  some stayed, some got theirs to go.  they also had two flat screen tvs on the wall .  one was playing the bee movie and the other had soccer.  overall our experience here was a good one and we will be back.  i may even bump it up to 5 stars after i try more flavors.  although if they always have red velvet......but then again it's good to try new things.  thank you zoyo!",1
"i actually love this little place. it's clean and the staffs are friendly!   first time i came here i got the torta cubana and the torta mexicana. both tortas were good, but i definitely loved the cubana much more. the torta (i think this is the bread part) is tasty and soft. i could probably just eat the bread itself, but the mix of meat and the juices...that's a whole new taste bud there...so good!  they have a few salsas and grilled veggies free for grabs. they also have ice cream or gelato; not sure which one. i haven't tried any of the desserts, but they look tempting.   came back and got the tacos de ribeye which is so good!!! they give you lots of meat and i love how it comes with a slice of avocado on each taco!   i didn't even know they had pastry on the other side of the restaurant until the second time i came...lol! i came here 3 times within the first week that i discovered this place. i'm actually not much of a sandwich person, but the cubana satisfies me completely. =o)",1
"first visit was not that impressive.  service was great, place was nearly full but the flavor profiles were way off with limp texture.    the tom yam goong soup was extremely sweet, not so sour and lacking spice but had a generous portion of shrimp and mushrooms.  the pineapple curry was made with canned pineapple that was excessively sweet and limp.  the pad kee mao had vegetables that were limp from overcooking. we had water for drinks so these three items totalled the bill to $39.00, tip additional.    every restaurant has feature dishes, we must have chosen some of the wrong items.",0
"the white picket fences and fake pigs adorning the place doesn't make me feel like in memphis at a backyard barbecue, but the styling is definitely a bit different than other bbq places.  some food items are good and others are not. fortunately you're able to mix and match menu items with the availability of combo plates. unfortunately, the chance of all those items being good is slim.  sauces are good, atmosphere tries to be very southern and the menu offers lots of options.  a lot of the food served has more fat than meat though. portions that should have been cut away are smothered in bbq sauce with the hope you won't notice.   there are better barbecue places in the east valley, much less the south, which is what this place tries to pattern itself after.",0
yet another cheap novelty shop that tries to pass itself off as artsy.   i thought this fad had ran it's course by the late 90's!,0
"loved the ambiance of this place. very chill, trendy, and homey. everything feels so familiar..in a: i feel like im at home drinking and listening to music with friends kind of way. possibly because it is a bar inside of a house? will definitely go back!",1
"if you're in the mood for breakfast food, it's solid. i live around the corner and have been going here for five or six years. the lunches are just ok.",1
great little hideaway.  been here for lunch and brunch and every time it's consistently good food and service.  a regular in the rotation...,1
"ok, i rarely give establishments one star, especially not when i initially gave the place three stars or above. i will have to make an exception for sun asian kitchen. the first time my husband and i went there (the experience i based my first review on), the food definitely wasn't outstanding or authentic, but it was decent. the fact that it was the only non-hole-in-the-wall asian place in south phoenix also made me settle on a solid three stars.   last night, on my way back from tucson, my husband called in an order and i went to pick it up. we got the crab wontons, chicken chow fun, and mongolian beef. when i got home with the food (after waiting 10 extra minutes for the food to be ready), we sat down to eat, ready for some standard but satisfying chinese.   well, we were in for a big disappointment. the food was awful, literally disgusting. to start with, the chicken in the chow fun was literally formed and the farthest thing from breast you can get - my husband said it reminded him of the way the chicken meat in mcnuggets used to be before they upgraded to all white meat. i figure if mcdonalds can make the switch, so can this place. i picked out all the chicken, hoping that the chow fun would at least be decent, but it was super-oily, so much so it was almost inedible. the crab wontons had literally two flecks of artificial crab in them and were basically stuffed with straight cream cheese. not good. the beef was also terrible quality, the only saving grace of the dish being the flavorful sauce and scallions. we both felt really sick after the little we did eat and wished that we had taken our $25 and gone to panda express instead. yeah, it was that bad.   the biggest irony of all is that the restaurant actually claims that they use top-quality meat. on their website, they state that they only use  ""top quality meat, seafood  and  the  freshest  garden vegetables to cook your food  to ensure  an authentic and memorable eating experience."" yeah. right. i know there's a recession going on, but serving meat worse than mcdonald's is inexcusable and will certainly keep us from spending our valuable food dollars there. a place called pan asia (advertises itself is having sushi and chinese fusion) is about to open up across the street (24th and baseline) in the center; it will be exciting to have another asian restaurant in south phoenix to choose from, and i hope that the competition will force sun asian kitchen to live up to their own promise to use only the highest-quality ingredients.",0
"fantastic experience from the moment we walked in the door. the atmosphere is modern and casual, staff are very accommodating, and the food is inspired. after dinner we ventured out back in the alley and upstairs to explore citizen r&d - a hidden away cocktail bar you have to ask about inside cph - quite an experience!",1
"front door the size of my college dorm room and decor inside as old as the hills. but the food is great. a little hole in the wall that always comes through in taste. my girlfriend is addicted to the carnitas tacos. tiny street vendor style things, she can't get enough of them.   i go for red chile and am always happy when i leave. yeah it's not fancy, yeah, it's never going to make it into phoenix magazine. but it's good. period.",1
i can't really say too much about the food because we didn't have a chance to eat here.  we waited so long at the front without even being greeted that we just walked away instead.,0
"always love coming here for the great food, great family atmosphere and the wonderful staff. been coming here since they opened their doors. way better food and especially prices than l&l or ono hawaiian. my kids eat up the musubi (spam, rice, nori) and the mac salad is ohh so good. i always bring family here when they are in town for some good island food. if you know a good easy recipe, just ask them and they just might add it to the menu. i keep meaning to get them the recipe for lau lau and crispy gau gee but i keep forgetting to bring it in. my favorite is the katsu, curry, and ribs (so good). take homes include musubi, mac salad, and my daughter's favorite is egg drop soup (you have to ask special for this item).",1
"most of the reviews i've read for this chain are mixed and i have to agree.  there were some great deals yet prices on other things were just okay.  the produce was not appealing at all.  if you're willing to hunt for bargains, you could probably do pretty well here.  i don't think i will make this part of my regular shopping.    note: they do not accept credit cards.  cash or debit only.",0
"so far so good.  the better half and i checked out the fresh & easy which will be in our new nabe once we move.  pretty cool.  we picked up stuff to make our own pizzas, a bunch of prepared finger foods for our finger food fiesta dinner, and some chicken and delicious-looking korma sauce.  i'll update once we've tried the food and see where things actually sit once we taste everything.  i liked the store -- kind of a small selection on some things (like only 2 kinds of dog food), but overall the selection of items was well-rounded and i'm eager to taste the house brand stuff we bought.   the staff was all super friendly and helpful.  one women who works there chatted us up about the products and highly recommended the tapioca pudding. i bought some and i'm looking forward to trying it. she said it's like crack it's so good.  that's an enticing vote of confidence.  more to follow....",1
"great work from the kitchen, but epic fail by front of house... if only that great food hadn't died on the pass! (6-8 minutes waiting!!) beer arrived ""cool"" and flat. (how long had it been sitting there?!) goddamit!  [it looks like yelpers zachary v. and dan p. got it right before me. poor service since at least a few months ago!]  the french onion burger was well-conceived and the ingredients were great! --perfectly-cooked medium-rare burger --gruyere on top. great choice, perfect flavor, but already hardening and cold --grilled onions were juicy and not too salty --even the bun was buttery and delicious --tater-tots perfectly cooked ### too bad it all arrived lukewarm and dead.  you know (or perhaps you don't) what ""dead"" food tastes like. if you don't know what that means, think ""taking home a to-go bucket of fried chicken with a side bucket of french fries"". when you arrive home, it's just faded! the fried chicken may still be kind of crispy and slightly warm and the fries may be tasty, but they've lost their life. they're dead! you go (or you should be going) to a restaurant to taste well-prepared food, from fresh, high-quality ingredients, presented just moments after cooking.  here's the timeline: # arrived, patio table filthy from previous diners. where's the support staff? (nowhere) # host didn't even notice how dirty our table was and take action to clean it # nor did our server when she arrived to ask us if we wanted waters. i had to ask her for a towel to clean it up. oh, was this supposed to be a sawdust-bar? # +12 first service (to take drink orders) 12 minutes. # +19 minutes orders taken ## +22 minutes beer arrives. for a place called ""cold beer"" and cheeseburgers, i want to be *drinking* a draught beer no more than 6 minutes after i sit down. ### the beer is flat and ""cool"". at +22 minutes, i was going to drink it anyway. goddamit! i am so mad at you right now! +35 minutes, the table next to us, having arrived after us, receives part of their order (2 plates) before us +43 minutes, the table next to us receives their other 2 mains. ## +45 minutes, our food arrives, dead +50 minutes, i sent it back saying i don't have time now to wait another 20 minutes for more food. +55 minutes my colleagues sitting at a nearby table get their food, having arrived a few minutes after we did # +75 minutes, i have to flag down another server to get our check  other suggestions: * redesign your menus. beer and alcohol menu reads like an index card i'm using as a cheat-sheet for a lecture. * as you present the regular menu, explain it to me. tell me that the apps and features are on the front, and the burgers (!) are on the back. talk to me about it, and get me excited for what i'm about to eat. don't just drop me and run. * it's *&@#$'n october in phoenix. the weather is fantastic. you gotta know that folks are going to want to find a place to sit and have a great lunch (beer and a burger) on a great patio. how can you not properly staff for a mildly busy lunch service?! * where are the busers, runners and support staff? (read: nowhere!) offload some of this work from the servers to let them do their jobs properly.   note: there may be a problem with my phone, but when i went to check in here and my gps put me on top of the restaurant, it fell to 24th on the list of ""nearby restaurants"". :/",0
"one of the best resorts.  whether as a hotel guest, or just as a guest walking on the grounds.  staff is kind, the drinks are pricey but delicious and they have the prettiest walking paths around.  there are plenty of private paths to take a romantic stroll, there are cacti and succulents to make life interesting, and there are gondaleers singing and willing to take you for a gondala ride.  if you are really adventurous you can karaoke in the karaoke grotto.",1
"eating with a fork is optional - how great is that?  (not a first date recommendation my friends!!)  good service always.  interesting menu options always.  wishing i brought more friends so we could order more variety - always!  personal favs - the collard greens and the spicy beef, skip the rice and eat more magic sponge stuff (i think in the bible they called it 'manna from heaven"").    all round neat place to eat especially if you get bored with mainstream corporate chains like moi!",1
"my 2nd time here, last time was part of a big group, this time was much better! able to relax and enjoy it! had kimow chicken and must warn, it hot! but i like my thai food hot!! my date ,he had the beef panang(red curry beef) also had thai iced tea for drinks, definitely needed something cold and refreshing!! and for dessert, omg! had lemon ginger cheescake, was fantastic!!  love this place and plan to return!!",1
"aaaaaahhhh olive garden.... as always the food was devine. our server, becca was amazing! our glasses were never empty and the food kept coming and coming! for once the wait was very short and thank god because i was starving!",1
i really love this place but tonight not just the salsa but also the hot sauce was sour. maybe it was because of xmas i assume theu closed. we asked for the manager and he brought out fresh salsa that was also sour. i cant think of any reason that would be acceptable. i know for a fact this placw jas a clean kitchen but maybe they need to revisit the inventory and product rotation. we got 10 percent off. but so me one please give me a reason why i should go back? thank fully i did not get sick. also let me add i love their crispy chicken tacos.  tonight is just wasnt good.  let me add that i have provably ate 100 of them over the last 15 years.,0
"so disappointed in my latest visit to kazimierz. i have been here before for live jazz and really enjoyed it. i liked the flights and the food.  however, we went here sunday and i was sorely disappointed. firstly, we picked it because a local website said they do flamenco music on sundays. i should have checked the website of kazimierz itself since there was no flamenco music. that part is not their fault. what is their fault is that the band they did have was, frankly, below average. a guy on drums, a guy on guitar sort of muttering very quietly into a mic for a few minutes between sitting with his buddies drinking for about fifteen minutes. not worth a $5 cover, folks. get some real talent in here, please or don't charge me the cover to watch the ""band"" drink and goof off with their friends at the table next to me.   secondly, we walk in and the place is totally done up in christmas decorations. it just really cheapened the whole place and i don't remember this place being so kitsch. i felt sort of gross and like i was in a bad sitcom. my first visit here was sort of that magical experience of finding somewhere unique with a great atmosphere of elegance, chic but relaxed at the same time. now, seriously, i wanted to laugh out loud when i walked in the door.  thirdly, service was awful. slow, snobby and inattentive. i don't recall that from my past visits. our waitress was seriously abysmal and more than once i was tempted to flag down someone else since she was just so cold, unhelpful and unfriendly. do you want me to order more so i can give you a bigger tip or don't you?   fourthly, we really wanted to have some cheese with our wine so we asked for a food menu and were told, oh, yeah, we closed the kitchen early tonight. just as an fyi, the bouncer taking my cover charge should have said something, or your website should have said something, or the server should have said something when she first graced us with her presence. we were there at 9, not that late, seriously. i have checked their website and there was nothing about them closing early, a little miffed about that.  so, overall, pretty disappointing and i have to say while it's dressed up like someone's trailer park, i don't think i'll come back to spend a lot of money on some average local band someone knows and bad service even if the wine is good.  the one thing i liked was the tour de france flights they had offered since it is that time of year. i'm still giving it 2 stars because i have had a good time here in the past.",0
"i liked them a lot until i had to call them to get the discount fare for the toddler but since i was booking our tickets together (because a two year old legally can't fly alone so i had to) on the phone, i wasn't getting the lower internet rate.  that's extortion!  i'd much rather do the entire thing on the internet.  then he tells me that the child's fare goes off of the regular rate which is only one dollar less than the internet rate.  what the hell?  why would i ever want to sit on hold for 25 minutes to book a flight to get this crap?  then they tried to get me to pay $15 more for the next class up (i know, upper class on southwest - strange).  i asked what i got:  1.25 times the miles (yeah, you heard right 25% more - that's going to get me far), first boarding and a free drink.  i clarified that with a child i get to board first anyway (they confirmed this).  then i asked how much a drink costs.  $5.  so essentially they are asking me to pay $15 instead of $5 for a drink i may or may not want (then again, i'm traveling with a child so who am i kidding, i'm going to need a drink).  and to top it all off, they tell me we can't do on-line check in because beckham doesn't have a picture id.  i tell them but he does have a picture id.  he has a passport, in fact he has two.  the southwest person tells me no one has two passports so i tell him that no, it's true.  the toddler and i both have two as we have dual citizenship.  (not that we would need them to fly to california so the whole conversation is entirely pointless now.)  the southwest man being the all-knowing scholar he is tells me that's impossible and illegal.  i take a deep breathe, tell him he's right, i'm wrong, how stupid i am.  i must be thinking of my library card.    why are things so difficult sometimes?",0
"this place is heaven for an antique lover, just make sure you set aside enough time to go through it all.  you will find great pieces and items are amongst this whole place, with lots and lots of choices and options and the prices are really reasonable.  my gf found an amazing solid wood coffee table for $199 that would easily go for over 1k had she gone somewhere else.    it's a fun way to spend the day with a friend or loved one and just relive the past, too.",1
"although in metrocenter which has really gotten run down over the years, castle & coasters (or golf & stuff if you are as old as me and remember when they changed the name with the new outdoor rides) is pretty cool place to take your kids between the age of 8-12.  the mini golf is fun but you will most definitely get lost in the many different courses (big deal, its still fun), the roller coaster is cool, the bumper boats, bumper cards, and golf carts are just awesome if you don't mind waiting in line, the new clothes line is cool but my 9 year old was to short.  they have a 2 story obstacle course that is safe for kids but a fun challenge that my son loved more after he did it.  there is a smaller coaster in the back for younger kids which is nice if you bring a 5-7 year old that doesn't want to go on the scary coaster.  the game center is really old and looks the same as it did 20 years ago when i used to go.",1
"this past friday, i was downtown with some friends, one who had turned 40 and had never been to a comedy club before, so why not!  tickets were only $22!  wow, ok, to see comedians from chealsea lately show, ok why not!    we received 2 for 1 drink passes to go to the bar next door and they would give us a buzzer to get in prior to people waiting in line.  ok that seems like a great deal!  umm..the 2 for 1 has to be the same drink, the waitress somewhat rude, and kept asking if we wanted food..nor did she tell us that we can bring the second drink into the show with us..9:45 came and went, and they were still not allowing people in.    when we finally got in, we got center area in the second seating area, so people were walking past us all the time!  and i mean all the time even with the comedians performing!  seriously, people don't have to get a drink that much! at least , do it between acts!   but no, all through the show.   so our waitress, rude and just unfriendly..2 drink min., of course some prices were not on the menu..a coke $3 in a plastic cup, seriously!  and then i was asked at least 2 times,to get my 2nd drink,  during the acts! seriously, can i watch the show!  i just asked for a bottled water to go, she came back with the cap off, so i asked for the cap and she did bring me a new one.  $5 for water.  i got the macaroni and cheese and it was just horrible for it to be $12..so our check was around $50. i wouldn't complain, if it was good but it wasn't at all.  and again, people in front of us the whole time! even the waitress were standing in front of us, taking the peoples orders in front of us.  and like everyone else, we had to wait afterwards for the bill which already had the gratuity added, nor did we add more, service did not deserve it.   comedians were ok, not as funny as i thought they would be.   all in all, i probably won't go back.  i went to standup scottsdale and had a totally different experience for the better.  i would've thought this club was in scottsdale  and stand up scottsdale was located in phoenix.",0
"i love breakfast places.  after 10 years in the bay area (where breakfast places are an art), i thought my breakfast dining days were over.  not so...thank you orange table!!  a slice of neighborhood heaven in scottsdale's civic center.  the coffee is good, the service was warm and welcoming, the menu is varied and yummy.  i loved the art on the wall and the vibe here is very neighborhood hang out and very little of the starbucks cookie cutter.  bonus that you can bring your dog!!",1
"yuck.   i've been dragged here a few times, food is always terrible. why is everything always sticky here? i've tried the big dad and the chicken tenders, both really gross. chicken is really chewy and the meat for the big dad sandwich is like, i don't even know. it seems like it has been stewing in a crock pot all day and then slopped onto your sandwich. really gross meat. the sauces can't help the horrible texture. unfortunately this is one of the only places that sell fried okra.   the service seems to have dropped off the map too. every time i order a side of ranch, i never get it and always have to ask for it. every time. i'm shocked at how many good reviews this place has, must be friends of the owner?   if you want some real bbq, try pork on a fork just down the road. blows this place (and pretty much every other place for that matter) away.",0
"in a city with very little in terms of indie bars, this place is probably the best.   i'm not sure why people are so down on this place in yelp. i only go there on saturday nights, but the drinks are plenty strong (if not too strong), there are usually alot of people dancing come midnight, the staff and djs there are really cool, and the music is the best of any place in phoenix.  all that being said, it's not that great of a place. it's very small, has very little space at the bar, has no patio where you can drink, has virtually no parking, has about the worst public restroom situation you will ever find, and they constantly run out of certain beers like bass or harp.  its really dissapointing that the best venue that phoenix can do for it's best indie dance night is a dive like this place, but its still worlds better then paying assloads for the terrible music and people at scottsdale and tempe bars. it does feature some really cool decor, great giant plush booths, a pool table, an awesome juke box, cheap strong booze, and the best indie dance night in the city.",1
"i hope i don't get lynched by the lucky boy-loving yelp mob but this place wasn't outstanding or anything.  it was good but nothing spectacular.  the burgers reminded me of dick's in seattle and the shakes reminded me of frisko freeze in tacoma.  that's a good combination, no doubt, but i just don't get the 5-star love.  it's good but not amazing.  it's an awesome spot and the employees are friendly and speak english.  i can't complain about that, i guess.  in any event, the food is pretty good so go by and check it out.",1
the sea salt and caramel is to die for!! yummy!! even with the smallest size you get so much. and i love the little wafer on top,1
"i've been meaning to try this cute little pizza shop forever and we finally took the plunge last night. i grew up on papa johns and pizza hut living in a small town and while i love those too, i also like the fancier, more simple pizzas that come from cibo and the like. i wasn't in the mood for the fancy types of pizza and pomo doesn't deliver so we decided to give it a try. after looking at the menu, i was excited to see that it was organic and seemed like a fairly healthy choice when pizza typically can wreck a diet.   we ordered the pear and gorgonzola salad (large), a small american pizza and a chicken sausage rustica pizza. ordering for delivery was quick over the phone and the total came to $30. that's a bit steep for delivery considering the regular chains have some incredible deals now but oh well, i decided it was worth the try! estimated delivery time on a sunday evening was 30-45 minutes.  i was pleased that the pizza's arrived much faster, probably closer to 20 minutes. the salad was large and for $8.50 it was pretty good. the balsamic vinaigrette dressing was a bit sour but it complemented the salad pretty well. as for the pizza's, neither was that great. i had requested extra sauce and my first piece of american basically had all the toppings slide off when i grabbed the piece and the dough was undercooked. i thought because their crust is advertised as thin and crispy that it could have handled it but it didn't even come close. the overall flavor was decent but the presentation reminded me of something you get at a pizza buffet. it looked like a highly processed pizza to me and i know papa johns is way better if i'm going to go that kind of route. i had one piece of the chicken sausage pizza and did not like the sausage at all. it looked really processed in this weird oval shape and didn't like the flavor at all. overall that pizza, minus the arugula (because since when is peppery lettuce so vogue?!?!) was pretty bland.   sadly, we won't be ordering pizza from here again but i might swing by for the salad sometime. one star for the salad, one star for the fast delivery.",0
"$5 glasses of wine. need i say more? ok. i'll elaborate ;)  amazing butternut squash soup. uh-may-zing. i couldn't eat the whole thing because it was really rich, but enjoyed the few bites that i took and thank gabi m. for the awesome recommendation. i noticed that they have a tasty sounding minestrone, but it include sausage, thought this was odd, but don't know much about italian soups, so maybe it's not that nonsensical?   post soup i had a tasty salad with grilled chicken. i'd say the salad to chicken ration was just a touch off, tons of greens, not much protein. however the veggies were fresh and crisp and it wasn't so overly dressed to a point that i felt bad eating a salad. there are a slew of other menu options including paninis, a burger that sounded killer and a nice looking dinner menu as well.   know before you go:  call, make a reservation, and ask to sit outside. period. if the weather warrants it, it's beautiful, and much more interesting than the interior.",1
"4 1/2 stars - really great place!  the decor is nice with cool artwork and beautiful flowers on every table, the service is friendly and food is authentic and delicious!  there happy hour specials are pretty good as well!",1
"i was afraid this place would be overrated, because most breakfast places are. i usually think, how hard is it to cook up some eggs? and most places can't cook pancakes and waffles better than my mom. i was very wrong, this place was so, so, sooooo good. i had the salami egg scramble with hash browns, everything was cooked perfectly. the toast that came with fresh preserves and butter was amazing! my husband had the waffle with real maple syrup (a requirement in my mind) and sorry mom, but this one was actually better than yours. with the waffle came a side of the thickest, most flavorful bacon i've ever had. i would come back here for the bacon alone! this place is well worth the wait.",1
"another great addition to downtown phoenix.  first, the westin hotel is absolutely beautiful and the restaurant/bar is no exception.  the indoor and outdoor space is great - relaxing and cool.",1
"had some apps & drinks here a couple nights ago. they have a really nice patio & it's a pretty nice location.  i'm all about food though.  we had mini chimis, beef taquitos & spinach artichoke dip - nothing sexy. seemed like the mini chimis & taquitos likely came frozen in a huge bag - have enjoyed ones we've gotten in the frozen section of the supermarket more. the spinach artichoke dip was kind of bizarre too. tasted predominately of cream/sour cream without much flavor.   would go back for a social thing but if we ordered food here, definitely would try something different.",0
"i really really really want to like the district!  but both times i was there, i had awful service - all due to the kitchen screwing up the orders.   the first time i was there i had the pork loin with the mac n' cheese.  after being the last one getting her food by a few minutes, the pork loin = not cooked on the inside.  i told the server and he said, no that is the way that it should look and went on about how they cook it back in the kitchen.  when i showed him the meat...he then said ""oh no!  that isn't how it should be at all!""  takes my food away.  20 minutes later...new pork loin.  with my waiting (everybody was done by then) not having it done the first done, etc...i should have thought that i would have been compensated for something.  nope nothing!  oh! and the server kept on forgetting to refill my iced tea...huge pet peeve.  2nd time was last night and my friend and i were sitting at the bar.  we ordered off the happy hour menu with the cheeseburger - no onion (me) and plain hamburger with nothing on it but grilled onions for my friend.  and we ordered sweet potato fries.  after a half hour (and we had tickets to see conan in another 45 minutes) our food comes out.  mine with onions and my friend with cheese and no onions.  oh, and no sweet potato fries.  we tell the manager the mistake and took our plates away.  we also told the manager and the bartender that we had tickets and had to leave soon.  10 minutes later...our burgers came out again.  mine was correct, my friend didn't get her grilled onions.  the manager told us that they do not grill onions.  ooooh-kay!  and still no sweet potato fries.  uh, where are our fries?  the bartender never put it in the system so the manager made him do that before we could get our fries.   running late....we scarfed down our food.   at least we were only charged for our iced teas for this catastrophe.  the end!",0
"i am pretty sure ted's has its status as a go to place here in az because of nostalgia. there are many places out here that are really not that great but because growing up these poor bastards had no good food are way over-rated at this point. ted's dogs are passable, their brats are just poor. the fries are awful. the last time i went there i had to fight vomiting for a bit after, i had two hot dogs (not usually a nausea inducing amount). thankfully there are better places popping up all the time now. better step it up ted's all those people who've been going here for years are gonna die and you'll be out of luck.   also the teenage staff makes the experience no better!",0
"first time walking into smashburger, and my last.   i've been doing crossfit for a month and two weeks now. so i've been eating very clean. i allowed myself a cheat meal today, since i've been doing so well. i figured i'd check out smashburger, being that i was at desert ridge. what a disaster!   i got a simple cheese burger with fries. the burger itself was jammed with salt, i didn't even want to eat it any more. i mean, did they unload the entire salt mine on that single patty??   i'm only giving this place two stars because the cashier was very friendly. otherwise, it would've only been one star.   i might have had a jacked up patty... however, i will not be returning.   wasted my dang cheat day!",0
"got to try cjb today and man i'm a happy camper. we bought a deal of buywithme.com where we paid $15 for a $30 certificate. it's great because we normally to to korean bbq in mesa, but this place is now my new favorite. we started with an order of the gyoza (4.95) they were lightly fried, crispy and just perfect. paired that with a large korean ob beer ($6). we decided to go with bbq combo #1 that came with bulgogi, daeji bulgugi (somewhat spicy pork) and dalk gui (grilled chicken). these are actually the three things we usually get, so it worked perfect. the combo was $30 and easily enough for 3-4 people, with the panchak (mixed side dishes) and rice. the bulgogi was awesome, super thin and great flavor. the dalk gui was pretty good, just seasoned chicken. the piece de la resistance was absofrigginlutely the daeji bulgogi. now this is always my fave korean bbq dish, but this ranks up with the best i've ever had. while it did lack some of the heat of other daeji dishes i've had, it made up for it in flavor and just overall awesomeness. the grill they had there was unlike anyone i'd seen, it was better when i had them crank up the heat and let it warm up for a bit. it was this odd round grill thing, but definitely did the trick. we finished the meal with a coconut boba. all total, using the coupon we ended up dropping a whopping $28 with tip. even without the tip, it still would have been a hair over $40 which is great. killer service, great atmosphere and rockin food. great to have a new fave korean bbq spot in the valley",1
"we love going to babbo, especially on a monday or tuesday for $5.99 spaghetti and meatball night!  check in on foursquare and get a free garlic hummus spread for the bread (delish).  go for happy hour (until 6 p.m.) and get even more discounts on drinks / appetizers!  the staff is always friendly.  the have indoor and outdoor seating.  the cookie dessert is amazing also.    we especially like to sit at the bar area since the view is better and the bar staff is exceedingly nice.",1
"the food is pretty good here, and the soft pretzel and cheese is excellent. there's great breakfast and lunch options. i've had good & bad experiences here with the service.",1
"it's in a neighborhood that looks to be conducive to quality mexican food.  i mean crap, chi chi's cabaret is right up the road (apparently).  but i think the food failed to hit the mark in terms of outstanding mexican/sonoran fare.  it was lackluster and not very tasty.  lots of decent reviews caused me to go out of my way to eat here with my family.  the prices were a little steep for the food they gave.  $12 dollar enchilada plates and $10 dinner specials.    i'd have to say the stand out entree of the night was my plate.  i ordered the mp-1 which was basically a green tamale dinner.  it was actually pretty good.  i like the hint of sweetness that is present in the masa.  the beans were decent as well and tasted homemade not canned.  but there wasn't anything very 'green' in any of the flavor of the entree.    otherwise, everything was pretty standard.  service was great.  food came fast.  but all in all, i wasn't knocked off my feet.    i might possibly give this place another chance.  i really did like the ambience and location.  we'll see.",0
"great food, great ambiance - but a little spendy.  it's an easy $100 lunch but the burger is one of the best we have ever had.  we have never tried dinner, only lunch.  well worth the stop.  great for kids too and has the feel of the tropics.  it's a real gem in kierland.",1
"been here before and the food was decent, this time was really good.  i got the black bean burger that comes with shiitake mushrooms, cheese (i think jack) and awesomely good, grilled maui onions...the bun was perfection! i added the side green salad, and that was also very tasty!  not only did we have a great server, but each month they pick a different charity to donate to! (i think it's a percentage of their sales on mondays).  super cool:)  i also really love what they did with the space...i used to come to this plaza a long time ago to rent videos from movies on central (rip).  they really jazzed the place up while still keeping the integrity of the original.",1
